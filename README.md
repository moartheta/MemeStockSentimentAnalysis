# Overview 

The scope of the project is to look at some momemtum stocks that are most talked about on social media platforms, and more specifically, are hyped by millenials. Perform sentiment analysis on 5 momentum stocks - Tesla, GameStop, PLTR, PLUG, and NIO. <sup>2<sup> 

We will use various tools and machine learning models to predict prices using closing prices of momentum stocks and perform sentiment analysis on these 5 highly touted stocks on social media platforms.

# Hypothesis
## Does social media chatter matter for stock prices?

*"Is what people say really a driver for stock price movements?"*

Our hypothesis for this project is to determine whether social meda chatter has an impact on the price movement of certain stocks regardless of any financial fundemental analysis.

# Model Summary

Elaborate on the predictive model used, describing why it was the best choice for the data.

# Data Cleanup & Model Training

*Describe the exploration and cleanup process.
Discuss any problems that arose with preparing the data or training the model that you didn't anticipate.
Discuss the overall training process and highlight anything of interest with the training process: Cloud resources used, training time required, issues with training.*

# Model Evaluation

*Discuss the techniques you used to evaluate the model performance.*

# Analysis Results / Observations

*Discuss your findings. Was the model sufficient for the predictive task? If not, why not? What inferences or general conclusions can you draw from your model performance?*

# Postmortem

*Discuss any difficulties that arose, and how you dealt with them.
Discuss any additional questions or problems that came up but you didn't have time to answer: What would you research next if you had two more weeks?*
