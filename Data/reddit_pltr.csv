"Part of what happened with GME yesterday, some things to consider moving forward.",0.98,"Long time first time yada yada yada... tldr at bottom

So did you see what all those stupid articles on whatever ad-infested websites were saying yesterday?? “GameStop soars another 50% from EPIC short squeeze, up 69% (nice) at time of halt.” You see this and think omg it’s actually happening. Wrong. Anyone with half a brain that doesn’t use the word retard while writing an article can work for those asinine media companies. So while a couple of us are partly qualified for those jobs and are able to fit the rectangle block in the rectangle hole, our pristine vernacular of the English language may have us shown the door (maybe the same one our friend at the helm of Citron is on his way through). Now even a former Boglehead like me should be able to figure out that the short squeeze has not been mcsquozen. Quick quote before we get into things...

I think it was Denzel Washington who once said “If you don’t read the newspaper, you’re uninformed. But if you do read the newspaper, you’re misinformed.” Definitely something to think about in this day and age. 

Anyway moving on. As probably many people at this point have already said, what happened on Friday was a gamma squeeze. This comes from MM’s having to hedge from all of us degenerates buying options. They however work a little differently than us when it comes to limiting their exposure. Us morons have to have 100 shares of a stock to be able to sell a covered call against it. If we had less than 100 shares, we may as well be as naked as the GameStop shorts. There’s this little guy called delta (frankly if you don’t know the Greeks it may be wise to take a quick break from options and learn those little buggers) that MM’s use as their indicator of how many shares they need to limit their exposure. Delta is a number between 0 and 1. Say you buy an option and the delta is .41, MM’s have to buy 41 shares to limit their downward exposure. But as the share price moves closer to the strike price, delta will increase and thus the MM’s will have to buy a few more shares (and vice versa with price moving down). So with the sheer amount of those otm options purchased yesterday (looking at you 55-60 calls), MM’s had to hedge accordingly, but as more people bought those calls as the price became closer and closer to the strike, it created a fun feedback loop where the MM’s were then forced purchase those additional shares as delta increased. So then after the halts, call buyers near and far took their profits which caused the MM’s to unwind their exposure bringing the stock price back down. If you bought $3,000 worth of 60c 0DTE and sold at the right time, you would’ve made a cool million+ (I know right what the fuck?!?!). So could this happen again next Friday? If a lot people expect a gamma squeeze like this to happen and buy a shitload of way otm calls, then it could be a self-fulfilling prophecy and there will be many new millionaires made next Friday. I personally have some PLTR calls I’ll be selling next week after demo day to try and fuck around with some 0DTE’s and most likely get burned lol. But don’t you ever listen to someone who says they know exactly where a stock price is going in the future and always do your own DD. 

Anyone else find it very odd that the highest strike price call option was only $60, AND THAT IT FINISHED ITM???? Either way calls with new strikes have been written (anyone see those 1/29 115’s lmao). 

So moving forward into next week, don’t be scared or discouraged if we have some relatively flatter days, we’ve been 💎 🖐 this far. Personally I would sort of like to see GME consolidate a little bit in the beginning part of the week (this is healthy for a stock - increasing exponential growth of +50% every day, while it looks just dandy on your account, cannot be kept up at any longer term rate). Also, as of today GME has 8 more days for their fourth quarter earnings. You know what this means? Buy PowerUp rewards, buy a console for your wife’s bf (preferably a bundle), buy used games (maximize profit margin), or fuck even buy Thor’s battle axe and use it as a butt plug for all I care (we know after the past two weeks that’s about the only thing that will fucking fit). An unexpected revenue and earnings beat, as well as profitability, may absolutely send this thing to the stratosphere. Why is nobody talking about Reggie as well as our three wise men from RC Ventures??? 

As a side note there’s also a lot of new blood entering from this publicity. Be nice to them -we were all beginners at one time so answer their questions, as basic as they may seem. Also be careful about what DD’s you may read, they could be using this platform for their own malicious benefit rather than the good of the group. 

TL;DR - gamma squeeze made some people rich as fuck, may happen again next Friday but it also may not. Don’t be scared of consolidation next week. Buy some shit from GameStop in the next eight days. Squeeze has not been squozed. 

And finally, thank the O.G. GME gang for the hundreds, probably even thousands of hours they collectively put in to help us all.

Be patient, be well.

"GME Benefits 4 All (Children’s Hospital, Employees, and young customers in hard financial situations) 🚀🥜",0.98,"I’ve noticed a lot of users making similar threads and those are all wonderful. I’ve been trying to get attention to Children’s hospital for over a month but my efforts haven’t gotten any attention. I’m also including other people because of things I’ve seen whenever I’ve gone to GME stores. 

This post will include 4 scenarios where we can help out. (There are plenty on Autism already, just don’t do Autism Speaks)

You don’t have read all of them, just navigate to what interests you. 


1. Children’s Hospitals: This one is close to my heart, and a brief story about it will be included at the bottom. 

I’m buying [PUR Memberships ](https://ibb.co/CKmS9h0) on their behalf AFTER speaking with someone in charge and verifying etc. Full details at bottom. 

2. Sad side of GME: I’ve seen so many young customers come with their parents (usually minorities) and want to buy a product, but the parent realizes it is above what they were expecting and could afford. Given how small stores are, everyone in the store hears that and the kid is just embarrassed.


3. The employees, remember today is a pro day sale. Perfect time to drop by with pizza &amp;amp; goodies or something else. Shoutout to u/txbustanut but not everyone has to do something similar. It’s all relative, just like how many shares we can buy. 

4. Offer few $10 GC to random people (maybe even to customers who are in store today but aren’t pro members...they can use it and become one...)


#Speaking of shares

Never feel bad or ashamed that you can’t buy as some people on here. Buy anything you can, you don’t need to be a whale, you need to be an ant. Ever noticed how ants work together and carry big pieces of food? Well folks, we are all ants, some just bigger than others. Do your part, we break down walls, and we all feast together and can spread the wealth. 



Alright, I’m going to include my original post from after we went private but couldn’t post here...mainly because I’m going to own up to what I said about BB and PLTR. I was wrong about it, however, the money put into those would’ve still got more returns yesterday in GME and definitely going forward....


#1. Children’s Hospital

Call up your local children’s hospital, ask for the donations department and speak with them. 

#little story time

I have a cousin who had major health problems when he was 9, he spent most of the year in the children’s hospital. I spent many days taking care of my other cousin / his 8 year old brother when the parents were working. It wrecked havoc on their life, but nothing gets me more than seeing how it affected my cousins. 

The one in the hospital would question if he would be “normal” again. The other one that I would look after, one time he turned around and asked if God really exists, and if he did, why is he doing this. 

**Holy fuck, I was just in my 20s trying to bang chicks before Tinder**...I didn’t know how to handle situations like this. 


Anyways, now that I got your attention...

Ask the person in charge of the Donations / Children’s Lifea department of what’s acceptable etc.

If you’ve remembered my posts, I’ve always had plans of starting a mass donation / charity effort. 

Based on my conversation with the lady in charge of the department, this is what she said would be the best option for that specific location, yours may vary. 


I offered to have a PUR membership and give them a choice of digital vs physical copy of Game Informer. (**Digital would require every kid signing in to same account...so not a possibility and best to go with Physical.**)

 No this isn’t specific to GME, but if you’re playing 💎💎💎🚀🚀🚀.

If you’re not playing GME, you can still make some kid’s day. 

Anyways, the lady said physical copy would be best because they can decide who would be the best candidate to enjoy it. 

You can also use the hospital’s phone number and let them know to utilize the account’s certificates for toys etc. There’s usually quite a few stuff on clearance that they can pick up, or you can etc. 

Maybe you’ve got more tendies to spare, ask them if they would be interested in Nintendo switches or traditional consoles. Buy used ones...with warranty...so if something happens, they can easily be swapped out. 

Ultimately it’s about making some kid’s life a little better in the dark, alone, segregated (even more now with Covid) and miserable time they are going through. 

Love you all, even the 🌈🐻, the ones who think BB has a chance, and the PLTR buyers in end of Nov.




#2. Sad side of GME

##This applied to me...I experienced this growing up. 

I had to save up money at 9 ( $70 )to buy a GBC (seemed forever) and bought a N64 + 1 game when everybody else was buying newer consoles. That’s all I could afford with money I saved and how long it took me to get enough money. 

I love my parents, I’m grateful for them. They risked everything for me to come to America and have a chance at life. It’s hard to understand that a young age, but I am grateful for them and still grateful to have them. But at a young age and not being able to afford things that everyone else has...well it affects the kid.

Well it’s not because of GME, but GME’s tiny store and close proximity layout makes it more noticeable than any other store. 

Ever been in there, and you see a kid <14 come in with a parent? They come in for a product and the kid is excited, then the parent finds out the price and realizes that it was beyond what they were expecting. 


Needless to say, the whole store hears it and the kid is crushed and visibly affected by embarrassment. 

Anyways, it happens often, it may not be every time you go in, but I’ve noticed it too often. 

I’ve thought about offering to cover, but that would add on to the embarrassment of a stranger doing it in person...


So, how about making a great relationship with the store manager or lead etc, and offer to have a “special GC” for that reason. 

Fill it up with $50 or whatever you feel like on a monthly or however often / after big plays...and ask them to use a portion of it for such customers.

This shouldn’t be customer wanted $80 product but up sold them with $100 product and offer to cover $50 with that GC....


It should really be like “hey we’ve got a customer who has donated some money and we can cover the extra $15 here etc”

Thoughts?


#3. Employees: 

Goes without saying, they are the front line and face of the company to the average customer. Today is PRO day, even dropping by with pizza and drinks would make a huge difference. 


#4. Random people:

Buy 1 or a few $10 GC, offer them separately and different times / places for people to claim them for free. 

You’ve now made someone save $10, and they will use it towards something at GME. Let them know it was made possible with the PUR membership and now they can have their own rewards and benefits for only $5...customer for life. 


Thanks for reading, make your tendies in whatever ticker you want, but 💎💎 hand with GME because we haven’t even started the squeeze. PS I personally believe in the long haul 2023 turnaround....",2021-01-23 16:32:51

-got a nice upgrade to BUY, ER Is around the corner. I don’t think the algos picked up the upgrade yet

[SPCE](https://i.imgur.com/qKQ1nS4.jpg)
-somebody rushed a bunch of calls through EOD. My best guess is imminent space launch

[NVAX](https://i.imgur.com/ebyj4B7.jpg)
-saw deep OTM calls coming in towards the end of the week. Could be big news coming, or could’ve been an assumption based on all the weird vaccine news about PFE and MRNA that came

Many more to be added Monday probably since it’s statistically the best day to follow whales. Some of these already had decent AH pops yesterday.

GME - Short Squeeze Power Level 9000,0.96," 

Disclaimer: **please check my work**, not an advisement to buy or sell or anything, etc. Just recording what I'm seeing, hope it's correct.  
(note to mods: original post contained banned tickers just by way of comparison - removed in this version, inclusion not important to thesis)

**Attention retards:** After Friday's short bloodbath I wanted to see if we'd made it through the squeeze for now and if all the low-hanging fruit had been shaken out. **Apparently not.** In fact, it's looking even harder for the shorts to borrow now.

Since [iborrowdesk.com](https://iborrowdesk.com/) only updates once a day in the morning for GME, I went to IBKR to check to see if the data there was more current. Turns out that yes, it had updated as of 1/23 and lo and behold, our **power level is 9000.**

**🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

**GME|USD|GAMESTOP CORP-CLASS A|36285627|XXXXXXXW1099|-32.6198|32.6998|9000|**

32% interest to borrow rate, 9000 shares available according to IBKR. That's $585,000 worth of available stock to short at Friday's closing price - 0.0129% of its total market cap.

According to the chart at [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME), this was down from 1,200,000 shares as recently as 1/18, one of only 4 times in the last 3 months that many shares had been available. The squeeze last week plowed right through that firewall. Now it's gone.

**Reading the chart:** ""Outlined below is a snapshot of the sample file output which includes the stock symbol, currency of denomination, name, contract identifiers (IB’s and the ISIN), rebate & fee rates and shares available.""

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**What I think:** This is going to be a very long weekend for short sellers to think over whether they want to keep up their strategy. We could be looking at another monster squeeze in the next week if the momentum continues and the big boys start unloading their positions. The pressure cooker hasn't even been turned on yet - my thinking is that we're heading to the Oort Cloud.

**Disclaimer:** I \*assume\* most ITM calls that get exercised this week aren't going to be available to short following the weekend - although I could be wrong.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**By way of comparison:**

BRK B|USD|BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC-CL B|72063691|XXXXXXX07026|-0.1700|0.2500|>10000000|  
BAC|USD|BANK OF AMERICA CORP|10098|XXXXXXX51046|-0.1700|0.2500|>10000000|  
BB|USD|BLACKBERRY LTD|131217639|CA09228F1036|-0.2767|0.3567|4100000|  
PLTR|USD|PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES INC-A|444857009|XXXXXXXA1088|-7.0276|7.1076|1300000|  


Major stocks Berkshire Hathaway and Bank of America have basically unlimited shares to borrow at 0.25% interest. Blackberry has 4.1 million available at 0.35%. Palantir has 1.3 million available with a much higher 7.1% rate.

Do NOT sell GME for BB/PLTR/anything until we hit $1000+,0.9,"I've been seeing a lot of PLTR/BB posts and people saying they're rolling their GME gains into these stocks. Shut up. Stop.

Mods have created a false narrative that the GME play is done for by making GME gains threads posts (who could this benefit??? Think critically.) Meme stocks mooning upon GME halt, RH WSBers did not move a 56.7B cap (PLTR) that fast upon halt, along with BB/AMC/? shortly thereafter. Who would it benefit to pump these stocks and take eyes off of GME upon halt? Think. Paper-handed fucks posting realized gains, bots talking about selling. Think about it, nothing is coincidental here. This play is no where near done. You paper-handed fucks will rue the day that this hits high triple/four digits.

I'm not shitting you. Price action today looked to be largely result of a gamma squeeze (MM's selling smooth-brains their FD's, MM's think FD no chance be ITM, MM's not buy a lot shares hedge, uh-oh FD's ITM MM's buy lot shares to stay delta-neutral). This means short-int is still high as fuck (AKA the highest % in history). This means unprecedented possibility in terms of price. Do not fucking sell. Do not fucking buy options. Hold shares! No more of this paper-handed bullshit.

Numerous meme stocks pump upon GME halt -> maybe draw a bit of a certain group elsewhere? Coincidentally, they pump when it halts, when gains threads are posted, and when threads are unpinned. Hint: us small guys don't move fast enough to pump that quickly upon halt. These guys are hurting, bad. Hold.

TLDR: Fuck off with the BB/PLTR shite, diamond hands GME.

We are poised for a 30% growth rate since 2017 and that number is not going to stop, as the company is still MOONing and expanding its venues

To quote [u/Healthy-Cash8610](https://www.reddit.com/u/Healthy-Cash8610/)

>For my analysis, I projected Callaway and Topgolf's revenues out to 2025 with the above-mentioned projected growth rates, and came to a combined revenue estimate of $6.63B in 2025. I then discounted this revenue back to current year at 15% to get a number of about $3.3B. With ELY currently trading at a P/S ratio of 1.51, this would imply a target market cap of about $4.98B with the discounted revenues and the current P/S ratio. The current market cap of ELY with the stock trading at $27/share is $2.54B. Based on my analysis this gives a potential upside of 96% with a price target of $52.85. 🚀🚀

If you are pussies who didn’t get onboard $GME, quoting [u/FatVegain](https://www.reddit.com/u/FatVegain/)

>GME is a literal war for the future of retail investors, so I’m holding my shares strong. Fuck short sellers. But $ELY is a definite steal right now considering Top Golf alone is worth $2 billion. Share price should double to realize it’s true marketcap. I think this will gain some momentum very quickly. Glad to find this gem before it catches up to its value. 🚀🚀

It has good fundamentals too

>I think $ELY is one of the better ones as it actually has a solid investment case vs just being picked because it has a high short interest ratio

Now I’m the only one getting onboard this. My fellow $GMEers & $BBers all know how undervalued this stock is. We are absolutely going for a ride up the moon once earnings are released on Feb.

But I want some opinions on our 2nd favorite Palantir. I saw a chart and lines drawn on it showing one of the most perfect symmetrical triangles with a strong uptrend preceding it. I was like ok that's pretty.
Then I saw some DD about demo day? I was like that sounds cool. Maybe they announce some data management software that helps with AI. I don't fucking know... But I bought 1/29 calls.

After today they basically made the most perfect triangle. Price consolidated until it crossed the two trend lineswhere they converged. Amazing. Mooned 25% my calls started to print like J-POW's

But what the fuck is demo day? Is it actually gonna be lit? Like is dude gonna be up there dancing like Elon? 
Do I hold until after demo day?

To all 💎🖐️: About giving back,0.96,"It's been downright inspiring to see how some of our lives have been changed with our stalwart meme stocks GME, BB and PLTR. We get to set the price on our exits, we get to dictate play. 

Seeing posts about those donating to charities is extremely heartwarming; I could never imagine people with the sole purpose of making tendies could band together like this. It definitely cuts against the ""idiotic retail trader"" narrative media has been pushing. 

All I would say is (as someone who knows you only though memes, rocket emojis and loss porn) that there are so many people who have had their lives changed in the completely opposite way this past year. It would be nice to see this sub band together and give back to our respective communities. 

This isn't a message to to organise a collective charity effort or push each other to donate, but just a reminder that out of the 2000% gains we're about to make from the 🌈 🐻 fuchs, 1% could change someone else's life, and give back some dignity to families using cash from crooks like MM who would rather have all GME employees out on the street in the middle of a pandemic.

WSB to the Moon and Beyond,0.9,"Started investing about a year ago and like many other beginners I didn't know jackshit of what I was doing (I still don't sometimes) Had losses and my impatience made me give up. Fast forward to August and tried a second time and same thing ended up happening. Well, November came and I decided to try once more. I started with a small account, and it's still small mind you, something that should be taken to the smallstreetbets subreddit really. Anyways, came across this subreddit and decided to try investing, the WSB way. While I may not be walking off with huge ass bags of tendies I am walking away with something and sometimes that's all you can ask from the market nowadays. Someday I may be able to make those juicy gains but for now I'm trying to help the cause with what little capital I can afford to give to buying BB since that seems to be the next move, came in too late to join the GME/PLTR train. So while you guys may be degenerate gamblers, you're ***my*** degenerate gamblers. Thanks WSB, may you impress your wife's boyfriend with your gains someday

"PLTR BOYS: HOLD THE LINE THROUGH LOCKUP, AND HERE'S WHY",0.97,"It's me again, your HSR Filing boi. First of all, congratulations to all you beautiful diamond handed fuckers who have been holding since our fetus first hit the market, and especially those of you retards who bought at $33.50.

I know the natural plan here for a lot of you is to sell right after the earnings call skyrockets our baby close to the moon because you're scared of how many shares are being freed up in expy.

I get your concern, *but I'm not selling, and here's why you shouldn't either*:

Lockup expys can indeed send a stock price plummeting. Everything simple about what you know re supply and demand.

They can also, NOT. (See Snowflake's brief dip to skyrocket after lockup expy). Are insiders going to sell? Hell yeah. But are institutional investors (who currently only hold \~12% of PLTR's shares) also going to buy? Hell yeah. [https://fintel.io/so/us/pltr](https://fintel.io/so/us/pltr)

Sure, insiders have been selling PLTR stock. Employees have been sitting on ESOPs with $1 cost bases for years. *But many of these shares have already been sold through the marketplace.* You think Daddy Karp is going to sell of all his shares after 17 years of forming this beautiful fetus only to sell it less than a year after IPO? NO (see my last fucking post). You see all these posts about ""the volatility and not-worth-it because of lockup expy"" articles? Do they smoke screen sounds familiar? Just like the bullshit gay bear articles we've been reading all month?

IMO, it's not worth the risk trying to speculate when (if any) the dip will be, because you might miss the fucking gravy train to heaven over a few percent.

**TL;DR: HOLD THE FUCKING LINE THROUGH LOCKUP EXPY, SEE YOU AT $420.69. Never bet against Karp and his ramen hair.**

Positions: STILL 850 shares, and a tit load of calls for may '21, nov' 21, jan '22. Haven't sold a single one.

&#x200B;

After market close, my dad walked up to me and asked to see my GME shares. I showed him my portfolio, and he asked, ""Are you also a part of the reddit army?""

GME🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Some context: my dad has been investing for 30 years: he is the type of person whose balls tingle when he gets a $1 dollar dividend and when his portfolio goes up 7% in a year. And today, he asked me about GME and the ""reddit army"".

PLTR🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

If my boomer dad knows what's going on with GME and shittron, then we know we're in trouble: even the most traditional investors know about r/wallstreetbets now. This is not a good thing.

GME🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Throughout the past couple of days and especially in the past couple of hours, I have seen my wsb feed become filled with posts showing screenshots of this sub being mentioned in countless news articles, treating this as if it were a great accomplishment. We are all over the news, but all this publicity is a bad thing for our community.

PLTR🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

The wsb twitter and the shittron research fiasco has not helped us: they help the media portray us as one voice and as an institution, when in reality we are many voices that are just looking to make some tendies. As you can see by my conversation with my dad, the public sees r/wallstreetbets as an institution. We need to stop any more acts like these that will cause us to get more publicity: this could get the SEC involved and have our community taken down and investigated for market manipulation. As u/Engine3er said, ""We don't need SEC to do us what your wife's boyfriend does to your wife.""

GME🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I do not want to see this community taken down: I have been here for a while now, and now primarily use reddit just for this sub. This sub is the only sub that I view(the other word is a banned ticker symbol) by new - although that may have to change since it is becoming filled with so much garbage and low effort posts from new members. You guys have become like a family to me. So we need to stop all this stupid shit and go back to just being a couple of autists trying to reach the moon.

PLTR🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Because of the influx of new people thanks to our publicity we need more mods. There are almost 2 million retards in this sub, and most of those retards are newly discovered. Despite the size of this sub, there are only 19 mods? We need more mods so I can view by new without having to scroll through a bunch of shitty posts that contribute nothing to this sub until I find a well-thought-out dd or meme. I would love to be a mod, but I've never done that before and have no idea how to even apply.

GME🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Sorry for the big ass blocks of texts and poor formatting, it must have hurt your smooth brains.  
These are just my thoughts regarding the quandary surrounding r/wallstreetbets, but I'm just a 15 year old autist who has only two stocks in his portfolio. Please address any mistakes I made in the comments, I was kinda ranting about this and didn't do any proper research other than listening to what my wife's boyfriend had to say about this. Please comment your thoughts on this so the fucktards who go straight to the comments know what's going on.

PLTR🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Thanks for coming to my ted talk.

GME🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

tl;dr:

* publicity is bad, stop doing stupid shit that will land us on the newspapers
* we need more mods
* stop making low effort posts
* stop treating the mess between Melvin and Shittron as if it was a war

Price and Number of shorted shares - correlation vs causation 🤓 ft. PLTR,0.91,"There is case made for prices not just reflecting simple buy and sell but also the amount of of available short shares to a greater extent. I'll take PLTR as an example, you look at PLTR when the price is low you can almost guarantee that the number of shares available are very little.

On **Jan 6th** the number of shares available for that day reached it's lowest and that's when the momentum swung back leading to the increasing trend seen below. On **December 15th** we also reach the lowest number of shares available and once again the momentum swings back.

Possibly because after reaching their lowest point you can't keep shorting so people start covering. Now this doesn't always happen but I can see a pattern that when there is a downturn and there are no available shares left, the direction of the trend reverses.

&#x200B;

[Points where shares available were lowest](https://preview.redd.it/f4wfn7lhkyc61.png?width=1115&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7aa29b08a026a1f979046f7cfc8e7d64901781d)

[iburrowdesk shares availalbe for PLTR](https://preview.redd.it/7ngpi1y6nxc61.png?width=1194&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff29e05ddbfe07cbfd30917b955ab1fcac21d8f1)

Just in **January 20th** PLTR shares available were around 200,000 and now it's at 1,000,000 and the price is starting to increase once more from the huge dip.

[Shares available were lowest before we see the huge rebound we saw today](https://preview.redd.it/0c395n68txc61.png?width=329&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa509c5a044839422db4fb41155868e120a3846b)

Now this doesn't always happen because on December 24th the price actually decreases to it's lowest. A possible explanation for the reversal is that a stock can't be shorted forever and when it reaches near it's maximum they start getting unwound. Also, it could just be a counfounding factor as short sellers know more about short interest than we do just like some shortseller said.

Now another reason that I can put some support to this theory is that in **October** when PLTR was trading at $9.00 the number of shares availalbe to be burrowed dropped from 6.7 million to 200k Probably even lower because you can't even see this on the graph.

&#x200B;

[When trading at $9 in october shares available dropped from 6.7 million to 200k](https://preview.redd.it/38zid15dsxc61.png?width=241&format=png&auto=webp&s=c77f35343a1af3c2dce3c27b3f3caf4964157126)

Another ticker is SPWR the number of shares available to burrow was very low and the price has been increasing astronomically with the new government giving lots of support to green energy.

Going back to GME - this was when citron tweeted about the 5 reasons and the shares available plummeted. Now it's near 0.

[GME shares available when citron tweeted which started shares available being near 0](https://preview.redd.it/0squxres7yc61.png?width=429&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ec01fefe08b7d33241a1bcb8f1d62f0d74ff026)

Did WSB inversers get a Margin Call today?,0.97,"Almost every WSB meme stock is up today - GME, BB, PLTR, CRSR, FUBO etc. The spike in BB directly correlates to one of the halts that occurred in GME, and I don’t think it is coincidence. 

What I think happened - due to a small gamma squeeze that happened in GME today, this forced the shorts to cover by closing other short positions. (shorts in PLTR, FUBO... you get the picture.) 

What does this mean for us autists?

The shorts of GME have TRIPLED down!! They foolishly believe that the short interest in GME will not result in the largest short squeeze in human history - and they are WRONG. 

TLDR: Mad money to be made in any WSB meme stock in the coming days if GME continues to rise and the shorts have to continue to cover!

"Are Surges In GME, PLTR Related?",0.91,"Total speculation on my part here, and perhaps the professionals who frequent here can help us out on figuring out if the lemon has been squeezed.  A preface, as many posts today have said, QUIT MAKING THIS SHIT PERSONAL, DOXXING IS NEVER COOL.  This is about making tendies.

Citron has been most public about shorting GME, and y'all have well documented this week's PR cluster surrounding that, culminating in the announcement that they'll no longer talk about it.  

We also have quite a few posts that the bump today was someone's margin call.

More quietly, PLTR has been steadily climbing today, and is knocking on the door of all time highs.  A reminder that [Citron called PLTR a ""full casino"" way back in...November.](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/palantir-stock-price-target-short-selling-position-citron-research-pltr-2020-11-1029845368)

Presuming they've still got their position in PLTR too, and PLTR gaining 25% today, we know they're hurting.

Both GME and PLTR are ""hard to borrow"" stocks, with GME's available shares to short well documented daily here as well.  Anyone have a read on how many PLTR shares are out there, and whether we've got a squeeze going on now there?  And, just possibly, if a certain firm is going dark today not because of Doxxing, but because every time the phone rings, margin is calling? 

Whether it is Citron or not, it seems that today was a great day to be long meme stonks, and a horrible, horrible day to be a short seller.

"UPDATE to Oct 27 DD for PLTR, with further explanation",0.93,"Follow up to my October 27, 2020 post ""**PLTR about to fly as high as those 2009-2017 DRONES over yemen""**

In the post I mention that with a new president, the US will most likely adopt a foreign policy similar to 2009-2017. In light of the new administration, I would like clarify and address some issues that have come up since my first post.

""Over the last month, Citi and Credit Suisse both **downgraded** the shares to a sell rating or the equivalent."" **(and people think we're dumb lol)**

Reasons include:

1. ""On Jan. 13, Citi analyst Tyler Radke cut PLTR stock to 'sell' from 'neutral.' In addition to valuation, Radke cited [“the lapping of Covid-19 related contracts”](https://www.barrons.com/articles/palantir-had-a-huge-run-up-in-2020-citi-says-its-time-to-sell-51610556595) this year and in 2022 as a reason for his downgrade.""
2. ""On Dec. 18, Credit Suisse’s Brad Zelnick [lowered his rating](https://www.barrons.com/articles/sell-palantir-stock-credit-suisse-says-questioning-valuation-51608315660) on the stock to “underperform” as well. Zelnick noted that the company’s “valuation \[is\] disconnected from fundamentals” and the stock is well ahead of itself. Additionally, the analyst warned that Palantir could be hurt by customer companies being reluctant to spend a great deal of money on contracts going forward.""

Well, I'm hear to say **fuck the nerds at Citi and Credit Suisse**. To address the first point, **PLTR didn't start as a COVID tracking company**, they started as a fucking **""track and kill terrorist""** company. COVID contracts are just icing on the **PLTR freedom dispersing cake**.

The valuation is disconnected from the fundamentals???? What. Just because these analysts **don't understand** the company, does not mean they need to **make some shit up**.

**(Most IMPORTANT)** Lets think about what PLTR does: big data. **Their data isn't your covid sick grandma**, it's **secret government documents**. Even if a worthy/better/less expensive competitor presents themselves, **which military or government official will take the risk of transferring large quantities of classified data**? NO ONE. The threat of spillage or losing secrets is a bigger deterrent than saving a couple million dollars. PLTR may get other competitors in their space, but **no intelligent person would take the risk of transferring TOP SECRET/CLASSIFIED data to a new platform**. It's not going to happen.

The idea that PLTR is not a solid company blows my fucking mind. This shit hasn't even started to fly.

TLDR: PLTR is extremely misunderstood. Just because Citi and Credit Suisse can't read numbers, does not make them right.

Unrelated, but you have have a DD without fucking charts or graphs. There are intangibles when it comes to a companies value. I can stare at a fucking cool graph, contract list, or an article about them ""potentially"" losing a COVID contract all day. It's not news until it happens. Grab your balls and hold strong.

I'm suspected that the runs from a couple of days and today Gamma Squeeze on GME probably forced some Shorters to cover their short position on GME by unloading their other heavily short position on wsb meme stock such as PLTR and other stocks to cover their ass.

Now PLTR is in the stratosphere without someone pulling them down even the hit pieces and also BB got another run from nowhere today even there is news of insider unloading their shares.

I expect to see more run on the stock market next week if this is true. Short are burning hard, and a lot of money is changing hands.

TLDR ; SOMEONE HEAVILY SHORT WSB MEME STOCK AND NOW HAVE TO COVER THEIR ASS BECAUSE OF GME

$GM & $F are jokes.,0.53,"Ford and General Motors are jokes. People in wall street are going crazy because these two stocks are years behind in EV's, the Microsoft deal is somewhat good news but using AI for cars takes experience and lots of data. I'm big on EV stocks and growth stocks, it doesn't take that much to impress me as long as there's potential and see proof.  GM and Ford are making EVs that have expensive old inefficient batteries and no software to make the motors independent to make them more efficient, they have no charging infrastructure and terrible milage. I'm more likely to put my money in $GOEV, $NIO, and Lucid motors when they're public. Startups have to innovate to stay alive, big carmakers have to put out a joke car so their investors think they will do something. Tesla has shown their innovators even while having the largest market cap and only delivering 500k cars a year. Telsa has the leg up in every sector but manufacturing power, which will change very soon. They have better software, better Machine learning, they have more EVs on the road giving their AI more data which makes it way better, their car efficiency is much better and they know how to make an EV  (now). They have better design and engineering, Ford and GM have a few cars combined Tesla has 4 out right now and 3 more on the way.  Ford and Gm even show that they are dependent on startups, remember GM and $NKLA instead of developing their own cars because they're too lazy they try buying a truck company that was public for a few months and no real working trucks.  Rivian and Ford not much more to say. Rivian is good but under funding from a joke car company, they will buy Rivian cut corners to make an easy cheap car. Ford and Gm arent innovators, you want a big car company that is somewhat serious good luck their plan is to buy a start-up.  Everyone wants TSLA to go to them, china loves tesla and they usually hate American companies that should prove how much countries want EV makers. The whole point is GM and F are jokes they got so used to making the same car and not needing anything they forgot how to innovate and bring change. VW their liars they can't even make a good ICE car how do you expect them to make a clean energy car without making an ICE emission problem almost no other carmakers have. You may see I'm a hardcore Tesla bull. You want 3 real cars $NIO and $TSLA and Lucid motors. You don't like Evs then GME and PLTR.  🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀. you can't make a car company into a high tech car company, you can't make a high tech company into a car company. they have to be one company, not a partnership.

[DD for idiots.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxl1ku/tomorrows_best_play/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

I’d like to start off by saying, this is not about $GME.

It’s about $PLTR. 🚀

I’m going to state my opinion on GME first however so I can get the criticism out of the way. I made my profits, got in at about $37, and I honestly doubted myself if it’d go up. I believed in you guys, and believed in u/DeepFuckingValue more than anything. I admit; I cashed out today at $71 per share. I made some good returns and whether or not it continues to rise is beyond me, I hope it does but I also hope that all the people who get in today don’t become bag holders. It’s really stressful, especially not knowing where the peak is gonna be. However, this is where I draw everyone’s attention to the best play yet to be made.

Today in PLTR’s unpredictable (yet predictable if you check my linked posts) journey we saw a good 15% run, and is still continuing to do so. Reason being that there’s a major demo-day happening for $PLTR on Tuesday. Followed by earning reports shortly after. This means everyone’s wanting to buy in now before the weekend and not having to get in last minute on Monday the day before. This small gain is only a fraction of what $PLTR is capable of doing, I recommend reading [this deep dive for retards](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxl1ku/tomorrows_best_play/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) if you’re clueless on why Palantir is a good buy. 

Here’s why I’m making a part two:

WSB is unstoppable, if you’re still a doubter. That’s probably because you’re a paper handed fuck who checks RH every hour of the day and wets themselves when they see -5%. If you want to play a little more passive for guaranteed free money, PLTR is the move. Upon this demo-day and earnings report I’m expecting nothing but good news, which leads us to lockup. 

Lockup will be happening very soon as well, that’s when 80% of the current stock that’s unavailable to be trader because it’s held by insiders (employees and some investors) will able to be publicly trader. You may think that’s a bad thing, however it’s not. Yes, I do think lots of shares will be sold off. Although, this allows huge investment firms to be able to finally get their hands on some PLTR shares that they haven’t been able to receive since its DPO. If major investment firms start claiming those shares upon lockup, then this is the inevitable moon we’ve all been waiting for. But what if they don’t buy up these shares? That’s where we come in. You’ve done it with $GME, you had faith in DeepFuckingValue. Now, have faith in $PLTR and Shuffil. You can either buy some shares now, which may seem high but I promise it’s only a fraction because $PLTR is the best long-term hold currently in the entire market. That’s a bold claim, but we all know it’s true. Just look at its infantile competition $SNOW, which IPO’d at @$200+. Take those $GME tendies and set yourself up for the Tesla of data analysis, something all companies will need in order to succeed in the future. 

TL;DR: Buy PLTR with $GME tendies. PLTR demo-day next week, followed by earning report shortly after.

🚀TSM World Domination: Beyond the moon.,0.78,"Don’t call me crazy yet, let me explain.

If you’ve been on this subreddit or know anything about meme stocks, you know about the stocks that have skyrocketed recently. GME, AMD, PLTR, AAPL, TSLA, NVIDIA, CRSR, etc. 

There is a stock that almost all the big tech companies, EV companies, and meme stocks had in common. TSM

If you don’t know what TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing) makes computer chips. You definitely own at least one TSM chip, whether you know it or not. 

Here is a list of a few of the companies that manufacture their chips with TSMC: (from [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20leading%20fabless%20semiconductor%20companies%20such,such%20as%20Allwinner%20Technology%2C%20HiSilicon%2C%20Spectra7%2C%20and%20Spreadtrum.))

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Apple Inc., Nvidia, Intel, Qualcomm, Xilinx,  Altera,Texas Instruments. 

It would take me years to research every single product that TSMC manufactures, but here are a few of the most significant ones that I found:


AMD:All AMD chips are manufactured by TSM any reason to buy AMD is also a reason to buyTSM 
   AMD CPU’s: This also includes AMD Ryzen Processors which are the most bought CPUS on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computers-Accessories-Computer-CPU-Processors/zgbs/pc/229189) As well as the processors that go into many laptops. 
   AMD Graphics Cards: Apple uses AMD Graphics card in their Mac products. They are also in many windows PC’s and laptops, and they are used by miners. 
   Xbox/PlayStation Internals: The PS5 and Xbox Series both use AMD CPU’s and Graphics, which are manufactured by TSM. 

Apple: Apple manufactures All of its processors at TSM. TSM made chips are in every iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, Air Pod, etc. the new M1 Apple in house silicon Macs are also made by TSM. 

Nvidia: Nvidia is the world largest GPU company. They also make self driving processors for Tesla, Nio and other companies. 

Qualcomm: Qualcomm makes Arm processors. Qualcomm processors power everything from Samsung phones to smart TV’s to Amazon Alexa. 

Xilinx: they make most of the 5G processors that go in towers and phones. Samsung Phones use Xilix cellular chips. 

Texas Instruments: they make your fucking calculator. 

There are many many more companies that TSM manufactures chips for. They are also on a more advanced process mode than any other company in the world. Do some of your own research and find out what other products TSM makes. 

See how many products in your life are powered by TSM. 

Chances are, A TSM manufactured chip could be inside your phone, your computer, your TV, your smart speaker and other smart home devices, your wifi router, your cars radio/gps, your cars self driving system (if your car has it). Your wireless headphones, the cell tower in your neighborhood. Even your calculator.

The “cloud” is also powered by TSM. The servers that google, Amazon, one drive, Spotify, Palantir, etc. 

If you can find just one area of technology that does not, at some point, use TSM manufacturing, comment it below. 

If you can’t then buy some fucking shares. 🚀🚀🚀",2021-01-22 17:08:29

GME SHARES PURCHASED
https://imgur.com/a/WZ3O6Hr

First, forgive me for my cowardice. I should have joined you earlier but I was afraid. I am new to this. In time I hope to grow massive balls like you lot.

I also want to thank citron and andrew cleft. After yesterday’s ‘live stream’ I felt he lacked conviction in his belief, this was evident in the way he spoke. A lot of Ah’s and Um’s, complete lack of charisma and confidence. Subjective but still. That and he did say some stupid things like issuing more shares to pay down debt. Which generally you don’t do (but can). He shouldn't be giving management advice if his goal is to short a share. The most important thing is this, conviction and faith. Have that, which he, and to point I lacked. Already you have seen people who had the balls to jump in make gainz.  Also as u/An_EliteMind_Ihope pointed out, citron is clearly lying, thank you for sharing this friend. 

Also want to thank u/DeepFuckingValue for his hard work. If I miss anybody I apologize. I usually lurk here.

The other thing I want to share is for anyone that was afraid to invest. A few days ago I sold about 814 shares of Nio and realized a gain of about $41,901. I apologize for the proof.

https://imgur.com/a/VFryR9L

Here in Canada half of that is taxable so $20,950. I originally sold to buy BB and PLTR. I still have positions in NIO, I do believe in it and I like how the company is being managed. However, I also purchased GME. The point is this if I get a loss I can net that against my gains. I’d rather make more money than pay my incompetent government taxes.  Since it is the beginning of 2021 I won’t have to pay taxes till like May or April of 2022. It also gives me a whole year to sit on this and realize those gains/losses when I need to. Plenty of time to get my shit in order. At the same time, you don’t have to sell. If you get a loss eventually any other position might gain that allows you to plan things out long term. If these companies are doing things you like ride it out. Ride to die. Don’t be a coward. As you have seen others have sold on  poisitions to diversify too.  Just some incentive for you folks. Now I am in Canada, and I am sure the US has similar tax rules. 

That is all I really wanted to say. This last bit is personal. I know I have bugged some of you guy’s for guidance and advice. I want to throw this out there. I do want to get into options trading or learn how to do analysis like you guys. I have somewhat learned by reading these threads and studying independently. I don’t care about being rich, I just hate being a loser in my 30’s. I am the son of immigrants, and all I have wanted to do is provide for and take care of my family. I want you to understand that so if you have some guidance or knowledge that has helped you please please dm me. That is all.",2021-01-22 14:47:33

ENG might be Daddy Elon's next pump,0.9,"Obligatory  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 something something GME BB PLTR

Okay with that out of the way let's see a simple relation that I found and that other retards might want to contribute to. I know ENG and green stocks are not really the move right now on the subreddit but hear me out one time

[Elon Musk Tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1352392678177034242?s=20) TODAY

[ENGlobal Statement](https://irdirect.net/prviewer/release_only/id/4597294) YESTERDAY

[Screenshot from statement above](https://imgur.com/s5reJyf)

If you search for ""Carbon Capture"" in the statement (and if you retards could read) you will see how they are actually contributing to the effort and plan on focusing on this market as one of their niches within green energy as a whole. With Daddy Elon tweeting this could this be a sign of an upcoming rise in the value of $ENG?

Also adding this just for valuation and true potential, we see how they are trading at a lower multiple than the bigger guys like FCEL and PLUG [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsT3YLLVoAMp781?format=jpg&name=large). This gives ENG more upside to grow 20x to match the levels of FCEL and PLUG, which would be a stock price of $140. That sounds outrageous and I'd aim for a lower target of around $20 for the short term until we really see traction and news on the company pick up.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Grab ENG shares, I've got 700 myself. If you're eyeing options try and hit the June 10c because timing this could make you into a loss porn.",2021-01-22 06:54:42

Playing a role of silent assassin is the best tactic that WSB possesses and it should not be dismissed,0.98,"**TLDR**: as you can see, based on what is happening now within this subreddit and publicly, sadly we are already being recognized as a single notion - radio silence for a couple of days, diamond handing/ignoring outside noise, removing your voices from youtube, twitter, other news portals is HIGHLY advised - **STOP mentioning WSB outside this subreddit - you and I, we are falling into a coordinated trap.**

To begin with, I am truly impressed with all the hard-work you guys put in whilst creating quality memes, due diligence posts, twitter messages and online presence.

But all being said, in the past couple of days we can notice the mentioning of /r/wallstreetbets come up in various ways within the social media - like twitter and benzinga, CNBC, youtube. The fact that we created a twitter account and collectively try and display our voice as an individual plays a huge downside to us. Now we are one, now we are acting as an institution, as a fund, as a united society - keep in mind guys that these notions are easily manipulated in the social media and it is way easier to target a single unified voice than it is to target a bunch of random individuals. When it comes to our beloved stocks like $BB, $PLTR, $GME it is important to highlight the fact of our **individual purchases**, **individual subscriptions** to their services, individual DDs and so much more. By silently increasing our positions as separate human beings, by silently promoting companies we are able to dish out more fire power which cannot be harassed online as we are under a cloak of shadow.

Pardon my broken English, but I hope you get the notch - WSB should not be a team or a gang - it should be all different individuals just sharing the same vision. **We must not respond to online media callouts**, we must not pay too much attention to news portals and videos calling us out. It only gives a negative outcome and makes us more vulnerable, thus allowing bears and other dipshit analysts to use WSB against their own stocks - detract other individuals/entities that may be interested in the stock by displaying us as a gang of monkeys.

I hope this message reaches some of you out, I have seen similar messages already hanging, but wanted to share my voice and remind you all - **we achieved such astounding results by acting separately** and based on a solid DD, **not by acting as a single unit**. Thank you and god bless this community.

**EDIT**: a very nice way to put it is to compare us to a beehive. It is way easier to eliminate a whole group of bees when they are in a single unit, however it is way more difficult to act against bees that are roaming free within the nature and may sting from various angles. **The unseen weapon is the deadliest.**",2021-01-22 00:06:08

"🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 BIG YOLO on $VST (Vistra Corp), 140 000K USD, ALL LEVERAGED.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",0.8,"First here's the story,

27 years old retard. Kinda new to this place, started looking into WSB and stocks around July 2020. This is my first big YOLO here. Total portfolio invested 378k. 198k of that amount is leveraged. I found $VST by accident while browsing undervalued stocks on simply wall street and the clean energy thingy caught my eye.

My total stake in $VST amounts to 140 000$ so basically all of it and more is leveraged. Started with 1000 shares at 21,63$ 19 jan. Stock went down today so figured it's time to buy the dip. Got 2000 more shares at 20,99$ today. Figured out this can't go tits up so bought 3500 more shares at 21,289$ today 21/01.

Now here's the DD with 13 reasons why $VST is gonna moon for sure.

1. CLEAN ENERGY: Vistra Corp is a clean energy/electricity producer, makes electricity with solar panels, wind and shit. With the green wave just starting, this is the future of energy.
2. BATTERY/ENERGY STORAGE : Vistra is the BIGGEST player in the game of Lithium-ion battery energy storage. Yes you heard me right, Vistra's facilities are bigger than papa Elon's (Sorry papa, please forgive me for my sins). Vistra is currently building those massive Battery/energy storage facilities in both Texas and California. Papa Elon's energy storage projects in California and Texas are just behind in line as the second biggest in both states. Don't believe me? Just look it up, I'm not making this stuff up.
3. INSIDERS RECENT MASSIVE BUY-IN: Look at those beautiful bars (Image 1 and 2). Insiders have literally only bought shares in the last months at around today's stock price. They know their shit. This is undervalued cause it was discarded by funds as a boring stable non-growth dividend stock, which it is absolutely NOT, and those insiders know it.

&#x200B;

4) BIDEN'S CLEAN ENERGY SUBSIDIES/STIMULUS: Biden just cancelled the Keystone XL project. If he doesn't want to encourage oil, where is he planning on getting energy??? Renewable shit like solar is the way to go!! Subsidies and big green energy stimulus coming our way boys!

5) THE EV CRAZE: Those EV companies growing massively are gonna need some fuel guys. Electricity demand is booming. So will Vistra.

6) GROWTH OUT OF US: Vistra make acquisitions in Japan in October. It's expending it's operations in both Japan and Canada. Again this clearly goes to show this is a growth stock valued right now at a boring stable dividend stock price.

7) BIG WELL ESTABLISHED BUSINESS: VST is the largest competitive residential retail electricity provider in the US. With a 10billion market cap, this is the real deal. Not a NKLA bullshit corp. This company is solid and is for sure gonna be the #1 clean energy provider in the near future.

8) SOLID BALANCE SHEET: Look at those beautiful graphs (image 3). Profitable company with rapidly growing earnings and new profit generating battery projects on the way, all of that in a clean energy growing phase of the economy.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ph5k4blkpqc61.png?width=1698&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e430c32a2c5ba1e9555c40e8417e701c6fb7710

9) GREAT DEBT RATIO: Debt ratio decreasing every year as the company became profitable! Look at that beautiful Debt to equity graph which says it all (Image 4)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4xf2rovlpqc61.png?width=1722&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ba078d095c5833fec396a726b2366c0b09a375c

10) HIGHLY UNDERVALUED STOCK PRICE: This Corp has a fucking P/E at 11.8x!!!! This is just absolutely insanely stupidly low considering the average US Renewable energy business P/E stands at 53x, and average US market P/E is at 21x. Even the P/B is low at total retard levels at 1,2x. For those who don't know fundamentals, a P/B at 1,2x means that at today's 21,5$ stock price, if the business were to close down everything, sell all it's assets, pay all of it's debts and liabilities and give what's left to shareholders, you'd be getting about as much as what you paid for. This is just plainly stupidly low for not only a growing stock, but an EV and green energy related stock as well.

The good thing about an undervalued stock is that even if you're a scared loser Cramer Boomer who spits on GME and PLTR, there's no way that an investment in Vistra can go sour right now at today's prices since it's undervalued even without considering growth! This is the perfect stock for retards as well as boomers.

11) DIVIDENDS AND SHIT: Dividends are for pussys. But if you want em', Vistra gives em'.

There's proof of my stake in image 5. It's in Beaver dollars but do the math, it all adds up in USD. If this post and $VST gains traction, I swear I'm buying 1000 more of the stock when it goes up to 25$ and I'll even go sell the rest of my portfolio to buy more shares if you retards want me to. As long as I've got money to buy, I'm buying this crap.

Groupthink and Tribalism on WSB,0.92,"Reddit has a impulse to become an echo chamber because of how the upvote and downvote mechanics work. People who are downvoted get their posts and comments hidden and eventually get muted, and Karma does motivate people to seek upvotes. The best examples are how r/politics become completely blue dominated with no alternative views, or people will post things on r/nottheonion and the comments get dominated as if it is r/politics. Alongside this, you see a gradual reduction in nuance, which in r/politics became ""mango bad"".  You see this throughout other subs on non-political topics once a tribal identity forms, and there is a strong tribal narrative on one side of an issue, and then people passionately downvote anything not in agreement.

On WSB, the mods banned political comments to prevent this kind of tribal BS seeping into the sub. But, we are starting to get extremely tribal about specific meme stocks to the point where it's very difficult to get quality DD on the other end of the issue. An awful lot of top posts do not have humor value as memes, and are basically - <ticker I YOLOed my entire account into>  🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀  followed by trash talk about some skeptic somewhere. I feel like arguing with people about a hot ticker now is like arguing with an anti-vaxxer friend about Moderna, or a blue friend about Mango's actual governmental actions, or a red friend about vote counting. It's really hard to be constructive or for anyone to get smarter.

If the goal of this sub is to collectively pump particular stocks, I guess this is true to form, but if the goal of this sub includes discussion to inform better trading outcomes for participants, this dynamic is greatly reducing the quality of trading discussion. Right now, the feed is almost exclusively just two tickers, and those threads have very few contrary views, even well thought out ones. When well thought-out comments are added that are not rockets and buy buy buy and either correct inaccuracies in the post or provide a reasoned alternative perspective, they get downvoted out of visibility. Even 4 or 5 months ago, I felt this sub was a lot different than stocktwits, but it's hard to tell the difference sometimes now.  I really want to be part of a community where we consistently find insight and trades that everyone else thought was dumb but was in reality brilliant, and that holds up some time later. The GME value thesis at $5 is one of those. So too was BTFDing the pandemic, and shorting it too.

I think this current tribalism is going to lead to worse trading outcomes for the sub in the long run. When we front-run a big wave of increasing bid on a stock, and then that price becomes stable or we exit before it's not, we outperform the market. That happened big time last year with Coronavirus, and has happened repeatedly with TSLA. In other cases we try to forget, it's been the opposite, like multiple times ahead of AMD earnings, PRPL, and over-exuberance with PLTR into the 30s. Basically, if we pump the stock, and then the broader community of investors doesn't come around to the point of view, we are stuck with the bag. And a lot of these outcomes come from when we are all-in and super emotional about it, which I think we all know is NOT how to trade if you want the best results.

We should stop downvoting posts and comments that are well written, and instead leave them alone or up vote them. By all means, downvote bullshit troll posts and straight up haters, but if you downvote quality contrary views, you make everyone here a worse trader, and increase the echo chamber that leads the sub to over-extend.",2021-01-21 17:28:03

PLTR is experiencing a heavy strong trend with a bull and flag. It's broken support this morning and is back up. PLTR has had positive momentum, tons of new contracts and lots of volume. It's been in this pennant and is due for a breakout. PLTR's Demo day is the 26th of Jan and earnings is Feb 11. Demo day is gonna showcase new Palantir products and outline what PLTR has in store for 2021. 

**A case for longs:**

Palantir aims to put together software that compiles data that provides insights into potential problems, solutions to these problems, and help solve complex, real-world problems. This data and analytics is fully interactive, and machine-assisted. So far, Gotham and Foundry are Palantir's products. Gotham is the military/government grade software and Foundry is the commercial equivalent. Apollo is a program that essentially removes the need for support teams when Gotham and Foundry need an update. Apollo gives Foundry and Gotham users the luxury of updating their software like it's an IOS update. These three products are the fundamentals of PLTR

Palantir's goal in the commercial and govt space is to grow in scope and scale. This prepares them for a horizontal integration. They are trying to build a wide moat for themselves in order to secure an opportunity for vertical integration as well. By preparing themselves for both vertical and horizontal integration, they are going down a road not dissimilar to that of Standard Oil. There is not a doubt in my mind that this company is run by people who know what they're doing. 

PLTR is now the biggest company involved in government data. The US cannot afford to have PLTR go under, and thus it will never go away- the only way is up. The real question is, how fast is it going up?

""Looking ahead, Palantir is poised to become the default central operating system for data across the U.S. government and its allies. The company also aspires to be the central operating system for data at large businesses and even entire industries. To appreciate Palantir's ambition with regard to B2B big data, it may be helpful to recall how much economic benefit has been captured by Microsoft (MSFT) after Windows OS took the lead over MacOS of Apple (AAPL) in the PC era, and by Google and Apple in the consumer mobile phone age with their respective Android and iOS operating systems.""

Competitors in this niche tech field are quickly swatted away. BAH and ACN lack the technical power and can't compete with PLTR pricing. Even defense contractors such as RTX, BAH, SAIC, and BAESF cannot compete with the costs and user-responsiveness of PLTR. You might ask why a big shot like google isn't stepping in to work with the government, to which I would chuckle and remind you that google stated they think the pentagon is ""unethical"" and prefer to work with the Chinese government on Project Dragonfly ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly\_(search\_engine)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly_(search_engine))). 

I'll go ahead and rattle off some quick deductions of mine. They have an aggressive merger and acquisition campaign. To grow into adjacent verticals, they absorb companies that are already there, quickening the speed they grow at. They are Capital-light and operationally efficient. Their ROI is very high and they can sell their product with existing hardware for as long as they are the best program to use. Meaning their software needs to be installed once but can be sold as many times as they like, as long as they keep their shit together. They are seriously dominating domestically in their niche. Their wide moat due to the M&A campaign and good management for vertical + horizontal growth gives them a monopolistic outlook. They are in the captains chair. 

**Forward thinking**

PLTR's last Q described sales growth of 46% in international sales. They want to move into Canada, Australia, UK, France and other allies of the U.S. They will very likely establish themselves there as well. They have a Foundry Joint Venture contract in Japan with Sampo Holdings for the wellbeing of the Japanese people. It was $500M. They are likely looking for a contract with Japan's government as well. 

My short-term PT for PLTR is $34, passing ATH. This pennant is a strong trend and it is gonna break out hard. All signs point towards a bullish breakout so I'm loaded up on calls, overexposing myself three times with what I'm usually comfortable with exposing myself to. 

Long term, I can imagine PLTR breaking $100 within 2 years. With a growing need of govt software and national security, *PLTR's value can only go up*

**TLDR: PLTR $34 by early Feb.**🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",2021-01-21 16:47:31

PLTR FULL DD 🚀🚀🚀[including Demo 1/26/20 (Huge Catalyst🚀) ],0.95,"This post is going to be outlining the incoming demo day for Palantir.  It is potentially going to be the single biggest event for the stock since inception.  I'm also going to shed light on how PLTR can aid in vaccine distribution (AKA a fatty contract with Uncle Sam).  Without further or due retards, here is what that demo will entail and the optics for how that will affect Palantir's price. (Hint for all the retards that can't read🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀).

What does Palantir do? Palantir is a software company that allows big corporations and governments to consolidate data into one interface and create analysis on that data.  To go more in depth, a company has incredible amounts of information and that number becomes unnavigable by an employee ass time goes on.  This is where Palantir comes in, they source data from files, emails, license plate data, weather reports, Really the possibilities for input are endless and addressed when the software is tailored to a corporation.  With that data it searches for connections and can draw incredible conclusions based on that data.  This is the chance to invest in some big brother tier tech shit at an insanely discounted rate, because BABY WE'RE going LONG🚀🚀🚀🚀.  To emphasize how widespread the applications are here are examples.

Gotham was used during hurricane Florence to compound flood and active weather data to show the most at risk locations so they could rescue those first.  (precedent for being used in disasters)🚀🚀

It is used in counter terrorism to create risk analysis for an individual.  Say that individual recently quit his job, purchased questionable materials from a hardware store and is making a trip to a country where he has no connections.  That is how easy it is for Palantir to prevent terrorism based on information that is automatically entered into he system.  There is also speculation that Palantir tech helped find Osama Bin Laden and the CEO can't comment (sounds classified) 🚀🚀🚀

Conclusion: TAKE MY MONEY PLTR🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Now onto the Demo day \[1-26-21 (4:30 ET)\] AKA ""Liftoff""🚀🚀🚀

Intro: Shyam Sankar 

Foundry:Bianca Rahill, John DiFulvio 

Gotham Demo: Doug Philippone (head of development), Andy Elder, and Martin Manville

 Also discuss NEW product Titan 

Apollo Demo: Clark Minor, Ali Mondro

🚀🚀🚀

This is Palantir's annual demo. Why is that important you might ask or worthy of being a catalyst for PLTR?🚀🚀🚀🚀

2 Reasons:

1. They are releasing Titan.  It is a direct upgrade of Gotham based on 10 years of learning.  Titan is going to be more ""performant, open and proactive"".  PAUSE: Look carefully at those words, performant and proactive...  Based on that and the fact that the Chief Operating Officer called it a ""force multiplier"", I am speculating that Titan will include a stronger AI integration.  If this is true Titan will be an exponentially more efficient system that requires less user input for final analysis.  Why is this important?  Palantir gives a lot of contracts that expire but leave the user with the old version of the software even if not renewed.  If Titan is such a pivotal upgrade of less user input (AI integration) and Greater magnitude (hence ""open"")  it will be a necessary upgrade and spur a new round of contracts.  And based on Palantir's fundamentals, startup costs for new programs like Titan are higher than renewals, so this means                            
  TENDIES ALL AROUND🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.
2. Currently there is a certain element of unknown associated with Palantir and what exactly it does.  The only demo we have is from a much older platform and doesn't show all the features to the public.  I think a huge barrier to the excitement we have to this stock is that we have done our research and know what Palantir does.  As soon as this is exposed to the public it will be a game changer for the amount of attention Palantir is getting and thereafter the demand for Palantir shares.  This stock is not on most peoples radar because they do not interact with it as they do other brands.  The demo will be a blow to this aspect and increase interest from investors and demand from customers eager to upgrade to the new technology.  It is also going to give this company the traction it needs to MOON and finally retain those day gains.🚀🚀🚀

If that wasn't enough for you Retards, there's MORE! 

We are now post inauguration of President Joe Biden.  He is eager to prove that he will handle the pandemic better than Trump did (And has already signed a number of Executive Orders pertaining to Covid-19 policy).  The single best way for Biden to make this happen is quick vaccine distribution.  Here is where PLTR comes in, Alexander Carp, CEO, recently interviewed with the Washington Post describing how Palantir can be used to distribute vaccine doses to maximum efficiency and to optimize limiting the spread of Covid-19.  Earlier this year it signed a contract(25M) with the Department of Human and Health Services to analyze Covid-19 data and give a path to the most effective vaccine distribution, this program was called Tiberius.  If the Biden administration can make quick work of this vaccine distribution and make the US a model, it will bring Tiberius to the forefront.  This will open the opportunity to license it other governments and also large healthcare companies such as chain doctors offices, nursing homes etc. to distribute their share of vaccines most effectively internally.   

When this happens PLTR will Fucking Print🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.

This is an incredibly understated value, we have a compelling shared interest with the brand new president.  The value that this has for the stock long is incredible.  It will put PLTR to the front of the line for contract renewals as a trusted agency that acted as a saving grace to the administration in the first of its 4 YEARS.  This on top of the fact that they have little competition to begin with means we will be looking through our telescopes to find the shares 🚀🚀🚀🚀

If nothing else, our beloved Cathie Woods (everything she touches basically moons) just stocked up on a JUICY 498,000 Shares for her \[ARKK\] ETF🚀🚀🚀.

Position/ 80 shares \~$25

TLDR: Next Gen software catches bad guys and can also be used by businesses.  In bed with uncle Sam and Biden will keep it that way (Tiberius).  Demo will increase demand on both sides and trigger new contracts so we can sit back and watch this baby PRINT🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",2021-01-21 14:33:04

Understanding Palantir - Retards Edition,0.93,"Listen up you retards, I know that some of you can barely read, so I simplified [a recent analysis I wrote on Palantir](https://www.financetldr.com/posts/palantir-buysellhold-onepager).

**POSITIONS?**

JUST LOADED UP ON $10K OF PLTR. We're going to the fooking moon.

**WHAT IS PALANTIR?**

Palantir is a SaaS (software as a service) company that provides governments and companies with advanced data analysis tools. In other words, Palantir gets paid to help organizations understand their disparate data in novel and valuable ways.

Palantir has three main products:

* Gotham: One of Palantir's earliest products used primarily by governments to perform general purpose data analyses on a broad data set (e.g. geospatial and statistical analysis). Gotham is very useful in discovering bad actors in a system.
* Foundry: A newer product targeted at businesses to help make forward-looking business decisions. Foundry is designed for ease of use by a large team of data analysts working on the same data sets, as is commonly found in companies.
* Apollo: A world-class continuous deployment system, Apollo allows Palantir to rapidly deploy upgrades to their software whether it's hosted in in-house data centers or in their customers's data centers.

**WHY PALANTIR?**

* SOLID GROWTH: Average revenue per customer grew at an annual rate of 30% since 2009 and contribution margins (margins per product) improved by 4x since 2019. In addition, top line revenue grew by 24.7% in 2019 and is expected to grow by more than 40% in 2020 due to COVID.
* SIGNIFICANT EARLY INVESTMENT, CLOSE TO PROFITABLE: bears say ""NoT pRoFiTaBlE In 17 yEaRs"". Bulls know this is actually bullish. Big investment = big rewards and Palantir's three flagship products are paying off now
* WORLD-CLASS TECHNOLOGY: Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo are state-of-the-art technology. Just watch some of their tech talks and investor presentations. Truly impressive.
* LACK OF COMPETITION: Peter Thiel thinks that competitions are for losers. Do you know what else is for losers? Being a PLTR bear. But also, PLTR has no competition. No other company is able to do broad data analysis from random data sources like they can. No other company is willing to work w/ government like PLTR is willing to.
* LEGAL PRECEDENCE: PLTR literally sued the Army for not using them, and WON.
* SKYWISE CASE STUDY: worked with Airbus to increase A350 production rate by 33%. Now they created an open data platform called Skywise that more than 100 airlines are using.

**BUT WATCH OUT FOR...**

* LOCK-UP PERIOD EXPIRY: after the first earnings call in 2021, about 1.4B new shares should hit the market. So far there're only 244 million shares on the market. That's a bigly increase to float. But I don't expect a lot more extra selling. The insiders are probably just as or more bullish about PLTR.
* BIG CONTRACT RISK: PLTR's $1B revenue consists of several large contracts, like one that is $300 million. Losing a big contract is no bueno.",2021-01-21 14:27:39

Gamma Watch of Popular Tickers 1-20-2021 Roundup,0.87,"Due to the growing size of the sub, we've been causing more gamma squeeze events on stocks - GME last week, BB Monday.

Gamma is an option term. What it means in this context is the amount of stock someone short the options would need to buy or sell to hedge their position as price moves.

For WSB popular stocks, I believe that about 2/3 - 3/4 of all options were sold by dealers to you degenerates, which means that the dealer is now ""short gamma"", which is not a superhero movie involving dwarves.

That means that as prices move, dealers have to madly buy or sell stocks in the direction of the price movement so as not to lose money, because option dealers/market makers ALWAYS win (almost). This means that in some situations, moving over a ""gamma ramp"" (price where there's a lot of gamma) may be many times easier than in areas without a lot of gamma. This in turn makes a ""gamma squeeze"" where dealers are forced to buy or sell stock so as to not lose money (similar to short squeeze, which is when shorts are forced to buy, causing yet more buying, so as to not lose more money).

In most cases, gamma is not a meaningful effect on a stock, close to zero. But it can be a big deal. In BB's case, I think as much as 2/3 of the stock bought on Monday was dealers, and the weak rally today is evidence of that - no gamma ramp. GME is similar - passed a huge gamma ramp to get to the 30s last week (with dealers doing 2/3 of the buying), now kind of in between several gamma ramps, with dead zones 36-38 and 31-34.

Looking at gamma can help you guys understand what price actions are possible. It's a giant lever that can go against you or for you. If price is slightly above a gamma ramp, it's bearish because small amounts of selling can crash the price quickly. If the price is slightly below a gamma ramp, it's bullish, because small buying can cause the price to run up the ramp, while your downside is insulated by little forced selling by the dealers.

Note that when you buy NEW options from dealers, they just do the trade you do initially - buy a put, they sell stock. Buy a call, they buy stock. But from there, price moves cause them to match the stock price movement - they remove some of their short when price goes up and they sold you a put, and they enlarge their long when the price goes up and they sold you a call. Make sense? Thought not, work on your reading comprehension guys if you are trading complex derivatives with your life savings.

Keep in mind that in a lot of cases, there's no meaningful gamma, and no price action will occur.

I prepared today gamma outlooks on some of the most mentioned stocks - GME, BB, PLTR, ICLN,TSLA TLRY, NIO. Note that this tool ([http://www.tradingvolatility.net/](http://www.tradingvolatility.net/)) assumes that calls are long gamma for dealers, and puts are short gamma. I think when you guys engage a stock, it's more like 3/4 of all gamma is short gamma, put or call.  Thetagang shows up and gives them some long gamma.

Current popular stock gamma landscapes (IMGUR has been a bit wonky lately... hopefully its loading):

[https://imgur.com/a/1IrWNln](https://imgur.com/a/1IrWNln)

Gamma is only relevant relative to float. Big gamma matters more on small stocks. You will form your own opinions and trade accordingly, and if this sub lately is any indication, you'll read ALL information as UBER BULLISH for the stock you YOLOed on. But here are my interpretations coldly reading the data:

**GME** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Relevance: Very high - Big swings could cause MM's to buy/sell 1/3 of floating shares easily.

Reading: Somewhat bearish with bearish trend especially right above $40, but possibility of strong bull case on good bid. There is a LOT of gamma ramp, and looking at the picture, we are more 'on top' of the gamma than ""on bottom"" of the gamma. It turns out that the bears favor the ""on top"" position w/ regards to gamma. People have added a lot of bearish bets in the past few days in the form of puts under this price, which are fuel for the fire down, and can be seen in the graph as put positions. A lot more gamma ramp on net below than above. Bulls should be secure if this stock can get to the low 40s and stay there. If it starts moving down, it will run fast and then slow down at 36/37, then slow down again at 31/32/33.  Good news is that because of all this new put vol, the price action will be less naturally down in the base case as dealers dump their hedges as time goes forward, pushing price up gradually.

**BB** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Relevance: High. Big swings could cause MMs to buy/sell 1/3 of floating shares.

Reading: Bearish, with bullish trend. This was arguably bearish yesterday because we were at the top of a ramp. Since then, peopl ehave establsihed a lot of new positions beginning to form a bullish ramp. Bad news can send this back to 10 quickly, but not much lower quickly. Accumulation of new calls should start to make moving up a possibility though if people keep buying.

**PLTR** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Relevance: Moderate. Float is theoretically a billion shares, and swings could make MMs buy/sell perhaps 1/4 to 1/5 of that.

Reading: Slightly bullish. There's a sharp ramp down, but also up.. and  a strong buying trend will move this up, and there's large block of gamma at $30.

**ICLN:** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Relevance: Low. Why? Because this is an ETF that can be made/destroyed by issuer on demand.

Reading: Actually a little bullish. This is so much gamma ahead of price that it will cause a couple hundred million dollars of clean energy buying on a decent day. I know, weird?

**TSLA:** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

As usual a gamma monster, hard to read. 750m float shares.

Relevance: Lowish. Not that much gamma compared to float.

Reading: Bullish. Most of the gamma is above current price.

**TLRY:** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Huge OI on this one. 136m shares avail. Nearby gamma is something like 50m.

Relevance: High to very high. Maybe 1/3 or shares could turnover in some situations.

Reading: A bit bullish. Kind of in the middle of it all. Stock could move up fast on good buying pressure and get to low 20s on gamma.

**NIO:** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Relevance:  Moderate to ""almost moderate"". It's something like 20% of float near price in hedging obligations in aggressive cases.

Reading: Bullish. Gamma mostly above current price.

&#x200B;

**My relevant positions:**

No positions on most of these.

Short GME on puts.

Long term holder of TSLA shares **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Long BBBY on calls, but didn't do the gamma chart of it here. It's at the bottom of a gamma ramp: **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

But for people who can't read a fuckin chart I'll break it down for ya.

Reasons why I'm in big PLTR:

1. Beautiful flag setup.
2. The 7 & 30 SMA's (blue and white lines) are giving it some support for this bitch to pop off.
3. The 50 SMA (red line) has crossed into the flag and is angled up which is huge support.
4. HUGE** the MACD is about to cross to green. Think of that as the green light to liftoff 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
5. Blue vertical dotted line is DDAY which could catch the eyes of the big pigs with fat wallets.

Once this bitch crosses the flag all of the technical traders, yes there's people who trade on technicals alone and make more $$$ then your grandpa made in his life, will jump on this ship with us to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

There's enough posts about how this company is growing rapidly with contracts so go look that shit up if this doesn't twist your nipples hard enough to jump in. 🚀🚀🚀

"VSTO - Ammo Price to the Moon, Safe Easy 2-4 bagger",0.88,"While we wait for PLTR to break out of its wedge between 20-30, I wanted to showcase a company with some very strong near-term catalyst coming.

Vista Outdoor is the largest ammo maker in America with the acquisition of Remington's ammunition. As some of you know, ammo prices have gone exponential over the past year, with ammo prices going up 2-3x in some cases and continuing to climb higher.  Currently about 60% of VSTOs revenue is driven by ammunition, they own Federal, American Eagle, Remington (acquired in Nov) and Speer. VSTO currently has about 40% of the entire US ammunition market. Of the other major players, Hornady is private and Winchester is a smaller business segment of Olin.

So why does this matter? VSO share price had been falling since 2016 because of the Trump win in 2016, as a result, pricing on ammo and firearms dropped significantly from 2017-2019. This all changed with Covid-19 and the election of Joe Biden. While there is no data on firearms sales due to prohibition on a national registry for firearms, background checks serves as a good correlation for the number of guns sold as the majority of gun sales go through a background check. The number is up 60% YOY in 2020 from 2019. The FBI completed 39.7 million background checks in 2020, this means at least 40 million guns were sold in 2020 (it could be higher as you could buy two guns with one background check).

This has led to unprecedented demand for ammo. Ammo demand increased by 150% alone just in H1 2020

Due to massive shortages, ammo prices have literally been shooting up to the moon. For example, quality hallow-point 9mm ammo could be had for about USD0.35/round back in late 2019.

[https://www.sgammo.com/catalog/pistol-ammo-sale/9mm-luger-ammo](https://www.sgammo.com/catalog/pistol-ammo-sale/9mm-luger-ammo)

today, the same ammo costs upwards of USD1.4/round today, up nearly 4x in a year.

Manufacturers are facing unprecedented backorders. VSTO has mentioned in earning calls that they have USD1 billion in backorder for ammunition which would take 3-4 years to fill even if demand falls back to pre-covid levels. This means simply insane growth and margins that will come through over the next several years.

Now we get to valuations, the company is sitting on around 2.1-2.3 billion in normalized sales (about 60% from ammo), growing at 30% on a YoY basis which is still lagging because the Remington acquisition took place in November. Net Income for the company was USD60 million in the Sep quarter and is expected to be a blow-out in the Dec quarter, I am expecting somewhere around 80-100 million. If current trends hold for the next 4 quarters, the company will deliver around 400-500 million of Net Income. The company currently has a market cap of USD1.6 billion, which would give it a forward PE of 3x. During the Obama years, the stock was trading at 11x PE, and that was before you added about 8 million new gun owners, with more expected in the next 12 months.

This stock will easily be in the 40-50 in the next few months and 60-70 in a year and the Q4 earnings in Feb 4 will be a key catalyst.

Now lets talk about risks. People are obviously worried that there could be a ban on the sale of ammo. This would be shot down pretty quick by Scotus, I invite you to read Jackson v City of SF from the 9th Circuit Court (one of the least second amendment friendly lower courts)

[https://casetext.com/case/jackson-v-city-of-sf](https://casetext.com/case/jackson-v-city-of-sf)

""The Second Amendment protects ""arms,"" ""weapons,"" and ""firearms""; it does not explicitly protect ammunition. Nevertheless, without bullets, the right to bear arms would be meaningless. A regulation eliminating a person's ability to obtain or use ammunition could thereby make it impossible to use firearms for their core purpose. *Cf. Heller….*(holding that ""the District's requirement (as applied to respondent's handgun) that firearms in the home be rendered and kept inoperable at all times … makes it impossible for citizens to use them for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional""). Thus ""the right to possess firearms for protection implies a corresponding right"" to obtain the bullets necessary to use them. *Cf. Ezell…*(holding that the right to possess firearms implied a corresponding right to have access to firing ranges in order to train to be proficient with such firearms).""

As you can see, unless the democrats somehow stack SCOTUS and overturn Heller, ammunition is protected under the second amendment and will continue to be sold for the foreseeable future. Moreso, there are likely over 400 million firearms in America, that is a lot of ammunition (which is a consumable) which will likely be bought in the coming years for those firearms.

**Call Option on Chaos (Alternative to the VIX)**

So again, you guys are all convinced you'll make 10x from calls on GME, PLTR and BB so why bother with this stuff that's maybe a 2-4x. Well, we are all in the game of robots and momentum retail circle jerking each other (TSLA and NIO and we are hoping Palantir) and squeezing shorts (GME), this big bubble could come to a horrendous end if we start seeing real violence showing up in the streets.

Yes the right winged militias and antifa are just punching each other right now, marching around with rifles and plate carriers, and largely LARPING , but it doesn't take much for things to escalate. There are lots of Trump voters who feel like the election is stolen, and the body politics is getting more and more polarized. If a black swan event were to happen, expect ammo price to simply go even more vertical.

The real political VIX is in the price of ammo, and the largest maker of ammo is VSTO. I had been trying to come up with a way to find VIX proxies as rolling OTM VIX calls has a massive carry cost. I think VSTO is essentially a low carry/free VIX call right now, which allows you to take on more risks with other parts of your portfolio.

TLDR: start making bullet farmer memes.

I have about $100k in shares, about 10k in ITM Feb calls to play the earnings.

Pltr in ARKX possibility. Amended.,0.65,"Short DD but high potential. Look at this

Co-founded in 2003 by tech investors Peter Thiel and Joe Lonsdale, CEO Alex Karp and others, Palantir provides data analytics software and services to government agencies, including the Defense Department, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the intelligence community. It also sells to companies like aircraft manufacturer Airbus

Orbital Aerospace Companies are companies that launch, make, service, or operate platforms in the orbital space, including satellites and launch vehicles. Suborbital Aerospace Companies are companies that launch, make, service, or operate platforms in the suborbital space, including drones, air taxis and electric aviation vehicles. Enabling Technologies Companies are companies that create the technologies required for successful value-add aerospace operations, including artificial intelligence, robotics, 3D printing, materials and energy storage. Aerospace Beneficiary Companies are companies that stand to benefit from aerospace activities, including agriculture, internet access, global positioning system (GPS), construction and imaging.

WallStreetBets Impact on the Market,0.97,"In 2020 retail-investor representation in the stock market surged by 4.7% to a record 19.6%. Spurred by zero-commission trading and COVID tailwinds, this booming segment of stock market traders has reshaped market behavior. 

I've been scraping discussion on WallStreetBets for several months, and tracking how often different tickers are mentioned every day.

The graph below visualizes yesterday's discussion on the forum. Size represents the number of times a ticker has been mentioned, whereas color brightness represents the performance of the stock. GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) had the highest discussion count with 495 mentions and returned 10.89% for the day.

&#x200B;

[WSB Heat Map](https://preview.redd.it/48jg1izvjic61.png?width=1119&format=png&auto=webp&s=089b824acc9dcd7f89689c71d661f0d127d164ee)

A quick look at the above graph shows that many of the companies listed have experienced parabolic stock growth and volatility over the last several months. This begs the question: **Has WSB discussion been a leading indicator for stock performance?**

To test this question, I backtested a simple strategy that buys and holds the 5 stocks that were most discussed on WallStreetBets in the previous week. We ran this backtest using data from 2020.

The graph below shows the portfolio holdings by week (click for full-size image):

[WSB Portfolio Holdings](https://preview.redd.it/smkp7dualic61.png?width=1119&format=png&auto=webp&s=c95d1d4bbc1047a2c76b26fbfc3305143dc39d6d)

Tesla, Apple, AMD, Nio, and Microsoft were among the stocks that most frequently cracked the weekly top five most-mentioned tickers.

&#x200B;

Over the last year this simple strategy was up over 61%, with especially strong returns in the last quarter of 2020. The ""WallStreetBets Portfolio"" was more volatile than the S&P 500, but outperformed even during the downturn at the start of the year.

To take a look at the relationship between WallStreetBets discussion and market activity at a stock-level, I’ve picked a couple stocks that were among the most popular on WSB in the last 120 days and examined them to determine if there is a correlation between WSB discussion and share price and volume.

**Palantir Technologies Inc (NASDAQ: PLTR)**

Big data analytics company, Palantir Technologies Inc, had its highly anticipated IPO on September 30, 2020 trading at $8.20. Shortly after, on October 14, the discussion volume of PLTR tripled to nine counts as well as achieving a 4.65% gain on the day. WSB count and share price activity continue to share a positive correlation coefficient of 0.592 as the stock reached a 52-week high of 33.05 on November 27, 2020. *\[Note: A value of greater than 0.7 is considered a strong correlation. Anything between 0.5 and 0.7 is a moderate correlation, and anything less than 0.4 is considered a weak or no correlation.\]*

&#x200B;

[Palantir Price vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/f8p41x1jkic61.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=2090f0fba5f9ee39cf7f3ed21932d31d6a0e1264)

WSB counts and PLTR volume for the same dates recorded a correlation coefficient of 0.803. This could indicate a large amount of individual-investor interest driving the recent valuation of Palantir which features a low proportion of institutional ownership at 14.41% (3Q20), compared to the industry average.

&#x200B;

[Palantir Volume vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/4qiik9ekkic61.png?width=1354&format=png&auto=webp&s=074100895bb7e99da71462126ed7f972d5763948)

PLTR received three downgrades from investment banks between October and December 2020 but added a price target increase to $30.00 (from $18.00) by Jeffries on January 11, 2021, well above its current price of $25.64. Risks still linger as 2Q20 to 3Q20 EBITDA losses increased by 83% to an $848.1m loss and, as of now, positive investor sentiment continues to support an uptrend.

**GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME)**

GameStop Corp. has experienced financial stress in recent years as the retail trends which had worked in its favor continue to decline globally. Total Liabilities climbed 12.18% to $2.26B from 2Q20 to 3Q20. Before May 5, 2020, WSB activity on GME had been dormant averaging 3.83 counts daily YTD.

Shortly following this, several threads on WSB began to speculate on a GME recovery due to increased gaming activity and a large existing short position of 57 million shares at the time. WSB counts would be amplified after an investment from activist investor and founder of Chewy (NYSE: CHWY), Ryan Cohen.

Since May 5, 2020, GME has rallied 755.33% and WSB discussion counts averaged 55.34 a day making a positive correlation coefficient at 0.688.

&#x200B;

[GME Price vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/g8xj575nkic61.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b458e40d9866fbecbedc224b5679ba885463f5d)

The WSB counts and stock volume also shared a correlation coefficient of 0.628. This was exemplified on November 30, 2020, when stock volume spiked by 31.3m and discussion counts followed suit at 227 for the day.

&#x200B;

[GME Volume vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/3d3xn8dokic61.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=af618e9f2ea29d71d69d86dc1884a44ec42bbf24)

The mainly optimistic speculation of a GME recovery in May on WSB contrasted with most major media outlets at the time, which appeared to focus on store closures due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The rally and enthusiasm behind GME since that time was in stark contrast to many other corporations, 630 of which filed for bankruptcy in 2020 marking a 10 year high.

## Summary

There is no universal method of finding actionable insights when analyzing WSB, but discussion on the forum can serve as a useful estimation of retail interest. Companies that have had exponential growth with help from forums such as WSB are more likely to become transition to an organic growth phase with more institutional investors and less volume. Keeping an eye on rising companies on WSB could help identify an opportunity that many may have overlooked.",2021-01-20 16:36:28

A More Neutral View on Citron,0.64,"To further look into the history of Citron Research, I read the Wikipedia page on Andrew Left. Now I know how Wikipedia as a source can be biased and inaccurate, but there are several pieces of information here worth looking into.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew\_Left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left)

Contrary to everyone here saying that Citron has been wrong on every stock he shorted, WSJ says 

>111 Citron short-sale reports spanning from 2001 to 2014, there was an average share-price decline of 42 percent in the year after Left's report was released. Of those shares, 90 were lower one year later while 21 gained, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. 

Source [link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-short-who-sank-valeant-stock-1445557157)

Now this may be old data from 2001-2014 and his predictions may have become progressively worse ever since. I just want to look at the possible selection bias of PLTR, BB, TSLA, NVDA and every other one of his failed shorts.

However, here's where I think the juicy part is. Consider Andrew Left's checkered past:

> Left's first job was with Universal Commodity Corp, a high-pressure [commodities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_market) brokerage firm that hired salespeople to make [cold calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_calling) and push ""questionable investments.""[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left#cite_note-reut-12) Left quit in March 1994, after 9 months with the company. When the [National Futures Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Futures_Association)  sanctioned the firm in December 1998, Left, along with every other  former employee, was sanctioned for three years along with being  required to take an ethics-training course 

&#x200B;

> Left became active in [short selling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance))  by the age of 24. He has cited his experience with Universal Commodity  Corp as the reason he started short selling stocks promoted by  boiler-room scams. 

He has a lot of experience with securities fraud and uses that knowledge to short stocks with illicit activity. This is where he may have made successful predictions. Yet this is not without controversy. Many firms have sued Citron for defamation and deliberately crashing their stock prices:

> Qihoo 360 has threatened to take legal action against Citron Research, as has former [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) China chief Kai-Fu Lee, now the chairman and CEO of Innovation Works.[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left#cite_note-wantchinatimes1-41)[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left#cite_note-42)  In 2012, posted a detailed, point-by-point rebuttal, via Sinocism, to  Chinese investment platform Xueqiu.com, which also suggests that Citron  had taken advantage of reader unfamiliariarity with Chinese languages  and markets. Lee stated that, ""Since Citron has already made big bets on  these recommendations before their reports are published... Citron’s  recommendation doesn’t have to be right; Citron just needs to mislead  their readers to follow their recommendations!” 

Sounds eerily familiar to what's happened to GME today? I don't think it's a cooincidence. As far as I'm concerned, there is no fraud or illicit activity happened with GME, or the other meme stocks that he tried to short. He simply made the wrong bets, took positions in fields outside his expertise (fraud), and lost a lot of money. Now he is using his experience with fraud against us, deliberately pushing GME down so he doesn't get squeezed.

Point is, maybe sometimes Citron is right to short a stock when the company is engaged in fraud. But every wsb stock he tried to short was based on his conviction that it was overvalued, and he was totally wrong.

Going into tomorrow, I hope everyone exercises some caution. He seems to know what he is doing with market manipulation. Maybe trim positions a little at the top, and buy the dip once his dump ass twitter stream starts at 11:30. I'm bullish as anyone else on this sub, just thought this background info might prove useful as I don't see anyone else bringing it up.

TL;DR Be careful, shitron seems to have a lot of experience with fraud and market manipulation. Obviously don't paper hand, but tomorrow might be a good opportunity to manage position and buy the dip on GME.

oh and for good measure heres some rocket emojis 🚀🚀🚀🚀

EDIT: what I meant by ""exercise caution"" is expect volatility tomorrow, gme is likely to drop around 11:30 when shitron livestreams. At that point, selling will only help the shorts. Hold positions or buy the dip to average down would be the smart move",2021-01-20 04:19:21

Why the fuck do you think a company like PLTR has a 50B MC? This thing does similar numbers to BB but loses more money and is evaluated at 7-8X the current price of BB. It’s because it IPO’d in the middle of the EV/TSLA crazy and had all eyes on it.
 
BlackBerry, however, is a fucking dinosaur! You ask someone on the street that knows nothing about EVs what BlackBerry does and they confidently tell you they make old cell phones. You fuckheads and wetdicks would say the same shit a month ago. That’s not who they are anymore, they just don’t have an IPO to get everyone’s attention which is why you can still get it at such dirt cheap prices.

The past 3 trading sessions were the FIRST 3 trading sessions that this thing has started trading as a speculative play, as it should! It has a new Cybersecurity suite to compete with CRWD, new partnership with AMZN to be a huge player in EV/AV. Huge partnerships with countless OEMs and carmakers, potential to partner with Tesla and it’s about damn time you autists caught on. Instead of trading like the dinosaur company it’s been, it’s starting to trade like the future technologies company it is and will be in the next 3-5 years. This is just the beginning we have a long ass way to go and unlimited potential!

I have a question - isn't what Citron is doing a legit example of Market Manipulation?,0.96,"Greetings,

this is not a rage post for the less gains of PLTR or GME, this is a general honest question for you, market experts, from a student that has not sat in the market too long to know it's legal side. Is what Citron doing not illegal? Below is the image of Citron's price targets and stocks which were incredible misses based in the long run (credit to a comment under their most recent twitter post).

https://preview.redd.it/5bqxw7p36bc61.jpg?width=1472&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4feb091f746c4f37449cad8125259d696d242cba

Is this not market manipulation 101 at it's finest and is this legal?  Is there any entity that could punish them? Is there anything that we, the people, can do something about it? I am basically doing outright opposite of what they are trying to do and buying the dip on every single stock that they short, get some decent gains, but it troubles me so much to see a truly strong stock, for example, like SHOP and see it get downgraded so much just to derail the hype or a high price. Insights, please?

EDIT: and I know some of the comments will be that they are only expressing their opinion, but given the fact that they do have an influence on the market, shouldn't they be responsible for more things as well?

EDIT 2: I am saying this not to brag ""oh, stonk went up and someone downgraded it just to f w/ it"", I am expressing my opinion cause *Citron has a reputation* of doing such things when a stock hits catalyst/positive growth.

My First Story for Odin,0.92,"

My brothers in arms. Many years from now our souls will no longer roam this earth but instead feast in Valhalla. While filling our stomachs with mead and tendies, Odin focuses his attention on us and asks each of us to recount our first struggle towards glory.  

I know the first story I will tell. 

The year is 2021. The COVID pandemic has delayed my arrival towards off-campus university housing, but it's better late than never. My parents decided it would be a good idea to front my entire ""meal plan"" for groceries, utilities, and wash for the semester into my savings much like an actual university meal plan. Little do they know that they’ve just armed me for war. My honor and loyalty towards my countrymen (WSB) sent me into the front lines against literal giants (Hedge Funds) and the cuck lord himself, Melvin. I stand fast in the front lines with my ""meal plan"" money all in GME, BB, & PLTR shares. Only those with diamond hands stand by my side. At this point those with paper hands retreated at the first glimpse of the army of giants that lay ahead. 

For now that's where the tale ends. Yet a small stake compared to others, this is everything to my name. With my semester officially starting tomorrow I have approximately 15 weeks (or 107 days) to survive. I have already put together a shopping list that should cost me about $30. This means I can eat until 1/29 all things included. This $30 shopping list is what remains of my leftover “meal plan” as I could not buy another share of GME.

🚀$PLTR Premarket DD,0.97,"Alright, as promised in some comments last night I’ll give you retards some buy sentiment for Palantir.

WHO AM I AND WHY GIVE A FUCK

I am a big tendie eating retard that works military intelligence for the Marine Corps, I worked Palantir before they stopped funding. (Don’t let that scare you). I bought in day one around lunch, if you wanna see DM me and I’ll provide receipts. Additionally I’m now 135 shares in and opened 5 call contracts.

Military use of the program is simply not  “spying on you” bullshit they’d have you eat up on the 🌈🐻 articles that cause our tendie machine to slow down. In fact military intelligence is legally prevented from conducting intelligence on US Persons. I can’t speak for other actors in the Intel community but it’s expressly forbidden on my end. Palantir doesn’t enable us to spy on you, but it allows for us to compile data and speed high level decision making up at a rate that was simply beyond expectations previous to utilizing it. What does that mean? Well for one, if you provide military organizations with success in ‘killing bad dudes’ then they’ll always have you in their pocket. I say if your taxpayer dollars are funding a program, you might as well double down and buy what you’re already paying for. I wouldn’t bet against a country that nuked another...twice. We can talk about Japan more later tho.

Commercial use? The fucking cuck circus over at shitron fails to see that they’re reliably and consistently expanding business. France, South America, Africa, JAPAN 🇯🇵 (should’ve put Japan first but stuck with caps to provide a bit less of a smooth read for you autistic cunts.) I’ll elaborate that. Japan has been historically tough for US companies to break through to, but Sompo and its associates are big Palantir and we shouldn’t be taking that lightly. The uses for Palantir are unlimited and can greatly improve over time, with new products ie. Palantir Apollo. The market for data collected or data synthesis isn’t ripe with competitive companies like the 🌈🐻s would have you believe. Sure snowflake and other peers have similar mission but none have the same reach and same customer specific outreach and development cycle. I can’t express enough how much of a buy this is.

Palantir as a company. This is huge because it speaks volumes about where they could go. Palantir was operating shy of 20 yrs before their listing, and they’ve been increasing the amount of ‘news’ on their site loading up on contracts all over the globe. Sure their operating losses are scary at first sight but they’re dumping heavily into R&D, building new SaaS as mentioned before and expanding heavily into the commercial market. Karp is the new Jobs, or even the next Alphabet CEO. Palantir is headed to household notoriety. Expect it, sooner than you can imagine it’ll be everywhere, even Queen Cathie bought in. 

TL;DR 
I wear camo and hate life...but Cathie, Japan, and Biden are fucking fueling our little rocket, next stop, fucking Jupiter

Check out my New Strategy based on Volume,0.88,"Hello my fellow retards

As I already pointed out in my [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kicipr/how_to_spot_an_explosive_breakout/) I really like the “3 ascending volume bars” pattern. In my opinion it can be used to find a perfect entry point on any time frame. It works on 15M time frame just as good as on Daily or even Weekly.

Today I’m going to introduce you to my newly developed strategy that is solely based on “3 ascending volume bars” pattern.

In this strategy in order to identify a perfect entry point we will be using two time frames: Weekly and Daily.

What we are looking for is 3 ascending volume bars not only on Weekly time frame but also on Daily.

First of all I will show how this pattern looks on tickers that you all are familiar with. In every example there will be a ticker with two time frames (Weekly and Daily) and a finger mark pointing at a place where this pattern was formed.

So, here we go:

[XPEV](https://imgur.com/WeoOw6A) [WKHS](https://imgur.com/cdSGPEv) [ZM](https://imgur.com/TJjBnAm) [DKNG](https://imgur.com/ep6dab8) [PLTR](https://imgur.com/9EVYieU) [TSLA](https://imgur.com/Vi2Khxe) [TSLA](https://imgur.com/ZAHGB8y) [PTON](https://imgur.com/E1qPuL9) [NKLA](https://imgur.com/Icrhuci) [JMIA](https://imgur.com/aR6qSrm) [LAZR](https://imgur.com/1R3ONcZ) [FUTI](https://imgur.com/F3XlYNU)

Now that you’ve all seen how it looks on history and how much up-move  to expect in general I will show you how to find it in real time.

It’s actually pretty simple. All you need to do is insert the following simple criteria in your screener:

1. Market Cap. Choose whichever you like. I personally like under 10B. Tickers with small capitalization are really wild and volatile in general.
2. Performance. Choose – Week Up. With this pattern we are looking for tickers that are currently trending up.
3. Average Volume. Choose – Over 1 M. We don’t need illiquid shit.
4. Relative Volume. Choose – Over 2. That will show us tickers with ascending volume bars.

Here’s a [Finviz](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&f=cap_midunder,sh_avgvol_o1000,sh_relvol_o2,ta_perf_1wup&ft=4&o=-marketcap) screener with those criteria already input.

After we get results from the screener there’s a last step to make: manual selection.

First of all open the ticker on Weekly time frame. If it has 3 Weekly ascending volume bars formed then check it on Daily time frame. Also 3 ascending volume bars present? Bingo! We have a pattern!.

And last but not least I ran this screener yesterday to see if the pattern was present on Friday and It came back with 6 tickers that will high likely print within the next few days/weeks.

Here they are:

[CYH](https://imgur.com/VTpzwST) looks very bullish

[OZON](https://imgur.com/7ZtVfoe) looks very bullish. Recent IPO, great pattern, all-time high are all signs of the following up-trend

Nokia - Go Big?,0.94,"Prepare for a very lengthy post. **I have worked my ASS off on this**.  Fair warning, this post is an update for my Nokia idea on TradingView,  so when I refer to Reddit/WSB I am talking to you guys as if you are  looking at it from my TradingView idea. 

&#x200B;

Since my original ideas on TV and social media, there have been quite a few very interesting developments. For once, I'm not going to do just chart analysis. I am also adding a large amount of due diligence regarding options activity, social media activity, news articles, and comparisons against competitors. Financials are something I am still struggling to learn but hopefully will eventually get there. As far as financials are concerned, I do know that their revenue is down overall but their profit margins have increased. As far as revenue is concerned, Nokia has been acquiring a large amount of contracts lately in the 5G sector. Nokia also has a very good debt to asset ratio when compared against pretty much the entire industry they're attempting to capture market share in.

&#x200B;

This will start off with some regular old chart analysis. Support and resistance levels, and candlestick and RSI analysis. Bollinger Bands are self explanitory for the most part.

&#x200B;

Let us start with a crucial RSI trend I discovered on the 2 month time frame.

Spanning from 2006, there has been a consistent trend of attempted breakouts upwards and above 50 RSI. Each breakout has been a lower high thus far. Currently, Nokia is contending with this 2 month RSI trend line for the 7th time. This is a MAJOR area of confluence when combined with MA's, Fib retracement levels, and reactions in candlesticks.

https://preview.redd.it/xuobh6uor6c61.png?width=1930&format=png&auto=webp&s=580ba82ee3642e4332e1745ade50039ffc869939

&#x200B;

On the monthly, we can see that this trend line coincided with a major selloff in October of 2019. This selloff was caused by a bad earnings report on 10/24/2019. Earnings were estimated to be $0.05 but reported $0.01 which had a -69.42% surprise of -$0.04. Prior to this, the month of August broke down below this trend line. During the month of September, Nokia attempted to rally back above it on low volume. The local support level it was testing at $5.18 or the 0.5 Fib retracement flipped to resistance and caused a 27.87% drop after the bad earnings report. It was not until the month of June 2020 that Nokia was able to get back above this trend line. 2 months later, Nokia tested that same resistance level and was able to get above 50 RSI, but was strongly rejected. This rejection dropped Nokia back below the RSI trend line, but it was able to hold support at 40 RSI. The month of November 2020 however had a bullish engulfing candle to bring Nokia back above the trend line. Then the month of October 2020 had low sell volume and thus held as support. For this particular trend line, support has not been tested successfully like this since July of 2018. Note however, that the mid line of the bollinger bands is so far holding as resistance.

&#x200B;

Notice the giant bearish hammer the lower arrow is pointing to. That was the market-wide covid selloff of March 2020 and it closed directly at the 0.786 Fib retracement. There was strong bullish support residing at the 0.886 Fib retracement which not only caused the large wick, but strongly pushed Nokia back up and into the 20 year trend line zone of support. Since December of 2017, Nokia's price movement has been unable to close a monthly candle below this trend line. In October of 2020, Nokia once again successfully tested the 0.786 Fib retracement for support which coincided perfectly with the 20 year trend line and a diagonal trend line breakout.

https://preview.redd.it/giukvukpr6c61.png?width=1930&format=png&auto=webp&s=613407c999d8e004c84d2943f562a04ef3ade19c

&#x200B;

The 2 month trend line also translates very well to the daily, where we can see that Nokia has successfully tested this trend line multiple times for support throughout 2020.

Since 12/21/2020, Nokia has so far successfully tested this support on this time frame. According to the trend, this \*should\* produce at least some upwards movement to test local resistance levels. Namely, the 0.618 Fib level at $4.34.

https://preview.redd.it/yad5hm4qr6c61.png?width=1930&format=png&auto=webp&s=b681b860cd1ad96f5260dcbd921187bfb59c1ba1

&#x200B;

According to the 3 month time frame, Nokia has \*serious\* support below the $tree fiddy price point, and 40 RSI. The October 2016 3 month candle tested 40 RSI and had a fairly strong bounce. Then a year later, same thing. From that point forward, this zone was not tested until the negative October 2019 earnings report pushed Nokia well below it. Then in April 2020, Nokia had a high volume bullish engulfing candle that brought the RSI back above 40 but was rejected at the 0.618 Fib retracement. After that 3 month candle closed in July, Nokia spent the next 6 months testing support. Bears were unable to close the next 2 candles below 40 RSI AND the 20 year trend line. The October 2020 3 month candle closed as a long legged doji on high volume indicating strong buyer support. This is a multitude of confluence that shows for the next 3 months at least, Nokia should have strong buying support.

https://preview.redd.it/tfl8spoqr6c61.png?width=1930&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7a82eb96ac9bb40322fcd96a849d7b81c566f72

&#x200B;

Now is time for perhaps one of the most interesting clues as far as Nokia's price action, the 6 month time frame.

The 6 month candle starting on January 2nd, 2020 is one of the strongest indicators that Nokia is soon to have some serious volatility.

It closed as a bullish hammer with very long tail and short upper shadow. This indicates buying support stepped in and held the line in a big way towards the end of the candle close. Volumes for this candle are the highest they have been since the giant hulk dildo starting in July of 2013.

The very next candle after this bullish hammer was a bearish spinning top doji- but was able to close WITHIN the body of the bullish hammer. This type of doji can indicate the beginning of a shift in sentiment, or a 'pause'. This 'pause' does sometimes precede a resumption of the prior trend. Considering the volumes in these 2 candles, Nokia is likely to experience serious volatility over the next 6 months. It is a very good sign though in my opinion that this doji candle closed within the body of the bullish hammer. The RSI however is pointing out a break of support, and subsequent confirmation of resistance. Nokia needs to break back above 45 RSI on this time frame in order to establish strong bullish bias.

https://preview.redd.it/mzv9hb6rr6c61.png?width=1930&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9d86440e0fba694083f58982c61ee810a8b79a7

&#x200B;

\*\*TLDR: Support is hodling but this is arguably the most important zone to decide Nokia's short, mid, and long term fate.

Immediate support levels: $3.80, $3.70, $3.50.

Lower support levels: $3.15, $2.44, and ALL-IN anything below that.

&#x200B;

Immediate resistance levels: $4.30, $4.50, $5.

Higher resistance levels: $5.18, $6, $7.50.

I happened to find a website to check historical data on options volumes and open interest. The position I currently hold are $7 call contracts expiring on 1/21/2022, so I decided to take a look at the data for them.

I also checked the $10 call contracts with the same expiration as they currently have what seems to be the largest amount of open interest.

&#x200B;

This is a short term screenshot of the volumes and open interest for the $7 call.

Between the end of December and January 4th, there were very slight fluctuations in the open interest, yet the volumes traded were above average.

Note that on January 5th and 6th, the volumes skyrocketed while open interest decreased. Strange considering the premium price of the options were on a slight upwards trend from that date. After January 6th, however, the the volume was mostly flat/average while the open interest significantly increased. January 15th, open interest skyrocketed. Interesting to note that this increase came after a significantly high volume day in shares.

https://preview.redd.it/7rh35wbtr6c61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ddb32cb0aaf3feafa248be19682bdb6887cef61

&#x200B;

This is a longer term screenshot of the volumes and open interest for the $7 call. Unfortunately, without paying for a subscription this website only allows you to see historical data spanning roughly 3 months.

Still, this screenshot shows multiple significant trends in the options for this particular contract.

The first thing that obviously catches the eye is the enormous volume and drop in option premium price/open interest that happened right before November. On October 29th, Nokia released an earnings report. This particular report showed an expected earnings per share of $0.06, but the actual reported earnings per share were $0.04, which was a surprise of -$0.02 or -36.37%. As of the opening bell for trading, Nokia dropped by 18.99% in 1 hour, eventually bottoming out at $3.21 a few hours later after a 20.72% decline in share price. After this 'cleanse', the $7 call option mostly traded flat for another 12 days thereafter. On the 13th day, open interest began rising again. Currently, Nokia's $7 call 1/21/22 contract has an open interest of roughly 135,000 contracts.

https://preview.redd.it/vy82mmstr6c61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=c37840bae667ba18c238536ad190d79240daaf38

&#x200B;

This is a short term screenshot of the volumes and open interest for the $10 call.

Unlike the strange activity in the $7 call, the overall trend for the open interest in the $10 call has only been upwards since the 17th of December onwards. Volumes have mostly been flat up until the 14th when Nokia had a very high volume day in shares. Otherwise, open interest and volumes in this contract have not had anything major to really report on other than a steady increase in open interest.

https://preview.redd.it/0mk1qbsur6c61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bb533c845998c0ab2f41060e7fb6140c4bf5c4f

&#x200B;

This is a longer term screenshot of the volumes and open interest for the $10 call.

This screenshot is quite interesting. There have been multiple high volume days for this option, but the one that specifically stands out was when the contract bottomed out at $0.08. From that point forward, open interest and volumes remained relatively flat. Notice that in the latter part of November, the high volume days preceeded a significant decline in the option premium price. From the peak option price premium of \~$0.16 however, the open interest only increased unlike what happened with the $7 call option on October 29th for earnings. The highest volume days for this contract in the timeline that I have to work with were, interestingly, the 14th and the 15th. This could signal another significant decline in premium price, or it could be a signal that Nokia's share price may be in the beginning stages of a rally. Considering historical data, history indicates that this \*\*should\*\* unfortunately be a signal for a drop in premium price. Whales love to mess with the noobs.

https://preview.redd.it/jx75xh8vr6c61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=88fa0f5529c4353abcb0fc044ae4546267bcb58b

&#x200B;

This is a screenshot that represents the grand total of all options traded versus share price.

For months, the options volume and stock volume have remained relatively flat until the 14th and 15th.

Implied volatility as well as volumes are signaling there is likely to be a major move within the next few trading sessions.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ua8dxbkxr6c61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=228aa40f5f450f8a1fb76cc0c94052c50dbdcd90

&#x200B;

\*\*TLDR: Options Open Interest is skyrocketing. $7c has weird stuff going on but $10c is stronger than a held-in beer fart.

On the other hand, the amount of open interest in the $7 and $10 calls could very easily be used to create significant bearish options pressure.

Kevin Stine, \*\*Chief\*\* of the Applied Cybersecurity Division at \*\*NIST\*\*, said: “5G will touch every aspect of our lives and security must be integrated up front rather than an add-on element of 5G networks. We’re looking forward to working with our project collaborators such as Nokia to show 5G’s advanced standards based security features as well an architecture that leverages foundational security capabilities available in cloud technologies.”

&#x200B;

Raghav Sahgal, President, Cloud and Network Services at Nokia, said: “Previous cellular technology generations have been industry-led whereas 5G development must evolve in collaboration with governments to ensure availability and access of secure trusted networks. The 5G Cybersecurity Project fills this role with a cross-section of government and industry collaborators on board. At Nokia, we embed security into every solution that we ship, and we are committed to enabling the secure shift to the cloud by working with government agencies and the industry to advance cybersecurity for 5G use cases that leverage both open and commercial components.”

Do yourself a favor. GOOGLE ""What is Zacks Ranking""

Zacks ranking rates a stock on a scale from 1-5. 1 Being a strong buy while 5 is a strong sell.

""The Zacks Rank is a short-term stock recommendation of 1-3 months that is based on analyst earnings estimate revisions. It is designed to weed out the companies with rising earnings estimates.

... Remember, the Zacks Rank is generated daily.""

&#x200B;

""People also ask: Is Zacks a good rank?""

""Since 1988, Zacks #1 Rank stocks have generated an annualized return of 25.67%, nearly three times better than the S&P 500's return of 10.79%. The Zacks Rank has also been very successful in telling investors which stocks to avoid. Since 1988, Zacks #5 Rank stocks have been flat..""

&#x200B;

Zacks basically states that Nokia is worthwhile with solid fundamentals and ranks Nokia a 3, or ""Hold"".

To comprise this ranking, however, Zacks evaluates a stock on 4 different areas. Value, Growth, Momentum, and an averaged score of all 3.

This particular evaluation is graded like a report card in school: A, B, C, D, or the big fat red F.

As far as the average Value, Growth, and Momentum score is concerned, Nokia gets an A:

&#x200B;

As far as Nokia being ranked a 3, or ""Hold"" rating:

""Zacks #3 Rank Stocks Can Be Perfectly Acceptable. 

I bet that title attracted your attention. You most likely have heard us refer to stocks with a Zacks #1 Rank as being the “cream of the crop.” It is understandable why. These stocks represent the top 5% of all stocks that are covered by at least one analyst and are expected to experience the strongest earnings estimate revisions in the future.""

[https://www.zacks.com/stock-education/54/How-to-Use-Zacks-Rank-3--Hold-](https://www.zacks.com/stock-education/54/How-to-Use-Zacks-Rank-3--Hold-)

&#x200B;

I'll admit, I haven't looked into the above claim of #1 rankings hitting 25.67% annualized returns. I am only adding Zacks ranking here for analytical and historical purposes.

&#x200B;

\*\*TLDR: Zacks rank says to hold, as it could go up or down, but gives Nokia a ""Grade A"" rating for value, growth, and momentum potential.

Social Media is by far my favorite trading 'indicator', because of how funny human behavior and psychology can be.

It is absolutely in my opinion one of the most underutilized tools a person can have in their analysis arsenal.

When you were a kid and someone told you ""I bet you can't throw this rock farther than me!"", what did you do?

Or how about as a kid, your closest friend/friends always told you that you'd never beat their high score in video games.

To this day, when someone or especially multiple people try to tell you that you cannot do/achieve something, what do you try to do?

Or how about today, where a very large Social Media sentiment is that Nokia is a complete waste of time?

The float of 5.6 billion outstanding shares is too high, there's absolutely no way the price can move!

Or what about all the people that had too strong of hands and didn't cut their losses much earlier on?

All those people trashing Nokia's name? Saying they can't do something? They won't move? Flatter than a pancake?

&#x200B;

I have noticed that within the past few weeks, there has been a significant uptick in posts regarding Nokia on the first and third largest investing forums Reddit has. Their names? /r/Wallstreetbets and /r/Stocks.

Currently, /r/Wallstreetbets has the largest following of 1.9 million members, /r/Investing comes in 2nd at 1.3 million members, and the third largest investing forum on Reddit is /r/Stocks and it has 1.1 million members.

Take a look around on Wallstreetbets and you will quickly realize that forum can legitimately move the market. No joke.

Teh stocks forum is far more conservative than the WSB one, yet, Nokia is still popping up quite frequently these past couple weeks in both.

Interesting to note however that the second biggest investing forum on Reddit is /r/Investing, and it has ZERO posts about Nokia since 12/08/20. That post didn't even garner a single reply. Hmm.. Weird.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What is my point here? What angle am I getting at? H Y P E. How do you create serious hype/FOMO for a stock in todays world? It needs some sort of 'reputation'. A very negative one is best. Why?

Nokia is known for having a giant outstanding share supply. They're known for being in a decades long downtrend. They're known for not being worth investing in, plain and simple.

So, back to human behavior. If you look back at the past year ish or so of comments on social media regarding Nokia, the stock has built quite the negative reputation.

&#x200B;

You NEVER hear about Nokia. You never see it in the news. You never hear its name anymore other than when people reminisce of the good old days- where products were ackshually built to last!

You don't see the Nokia brand anywhere anymore.. Its name doesn't show up on TV, or in the newspaper, or on ticker news feeds, nothing. Nowhere. Nada. Zilch.

What would happen if, say, Nokia suddenly had a +50% day out of nowhere? EVERYONE who ever doubted Nokia or even heard their name are quickly reminded that they are still alive.

These people are seemingly  so brainwashed at this point that Nokia is not a worthwhile investment, they don't even bother. Even though it just rocketed 50%. Meh, just a dead cat bounce. 

Nah, they'll stay out and chase their gains in PLTR or GME or BB or whatever the current meme stocks are for the day.

Next day, Nokia rockets again while maybe other meme/blue chip stocks and/or indexes are flat or negative. See where I'm going with this here?

&#x200B;

THE very M O M E N T Nokia rips a hulk dildo on the chart, everyone and their mother is going to know about it.

Meh, just a dead cat bounce. Right guys? ...Right?

Then it goes up. Again. While a lot of people including I/you were waiting for a pullback.

See where I'm going with this here?

&#x200B;

STRICTLY because of Nokia's reputation and the extreme negative sentiment surrounding it in Social Media, this is a perfect play.

When it finally rips loose, everyone and their brother is going to be waiting for a pullback. What if it doesn't come soon enough?

Imagine the FOMO.

A multi decade long downtrend is clearly reversing. You can see it in the chart, trend lines, and in the sentiment. This was rock bottom.

\*\*TLDR: Imagine the FOMO.

Google Trends can be a fun 'indicator' of sorts to use. It doesn't necessarily mean anything, BUT, it can yield an interesting metric.

How outright BORING something is or isn't.

How UNDERAPPRECIATED something is or isn't.

How many people would choose to talk about anything BUT ... that.

How .. dare I say, \*\*undervalued\*\* something is? Or how popular something is? lolNokia.

&#x200B;

When you think of Nokia, what is the first thing you think of? For me, it is those damn 3310 phone models. The ones that just .. wouldn't die. No matter what you did to them. 

At this point, Nokia has apparently upgraded its appetite. Let's face it. In todays world of \*\*planned obsolescence\*\* especially in the smartphone world, Nokia doesn't stand a chance because of how many competitors it has!

12/2011 - 01/11. Nokia absolutely TANKS in relevance. I wonder why?

01/2016. Nokia suddenly for the most part flatlines after a decent drop.

If we compare this to a heart beat monitor, Nokia's relevancy is \[still\] legit dead. 

Dead. Not coming back. Can't start, won't start, NOStart. OD'D and narcan can't save it.

&#x200B;

Lastly, I would just like to address the echo chambered and (in MY opinion) incorrect opinion of how Nokia cannot move well or quickly in price because of what I will call ""The Float Fallacy.""

Nokia has a grand total of 5.6 billion shares that make up the company, otherwise known as ""The Float"". Nokia has a market cap currently of $22.1B.

That means when you multiply the total supply of tradable shares to how much money they each are trading for, you get the total overall valuation of a company.

The majority opinion everywhere on Nokia above all else, is that it cannot move due to its float size. Essentially, people are arguing that you'd need to buy substantially more shares

in order to move the price than you would a different company. While this is generally true, the AMOUNT OF MONEY TRADED STAYS THE SAME.

&#x200B;

To give you an idea of why the float doesn't matter, we can compare Nokia's market cap to the market cap sizes and share values of other competitors.

First example I will use is Ericsson. Ericsson has a market cap of $36.13B. Their share price is currently $11.76. Now, again, think about the MONEY, not the shares.

Say I wanted to invest $100 in a given stock. I could buy 8.5 shares in total of Ericsson. Or, I could get 24.5 shares of Nokia for THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY.

What sounds more appealing to you? Owning 8.5 shares in a company, or nearly 3 times as much?

&#x200B;

So let's compare market cap sizes with a few competitors to see just how much growth potential Nokia truly has.

We will just use the major companies listed alongside Nokia on the U.S. Federal 5G Cybersecurity Project.

&#x200B;

AT&T

Market cap: $207.87B

Share price: $29.17

Float: 7.13B

&#x200B;

Cisco

Market cap: $191.97B

Share price: $45.43

Float: 4.22B

&#x200B;

Dell

Market cap: $55.68B

Share price: $74.26

Float: 0.77B

&#x200B;

Intel

Market cap: $235.96B

Share price: $57.58

Float: 4.1B

&#x200B;

T-Mobile

Market cap: $157.98B

Share price: $127.28

Float: 1.24B

&#x200B;

These figures show the valuation that Nokia can and will eventually hit.

The only real negative effect of having 5.6 billion outstanding shares is that it can take a while for them to become more widely dispersed rather than overconcentrated.

Meaning a very select few absurdly rich people can and have been suppressing the price. The more they do it though, the more insane opportunities it gives you. That's the entire point.

So, in a way, float does matter, but that is EXACTLY WHY this is such a winning proposition. The more shares WE buy, the less THEY have and can control.

 

anddd, I'm done. Finally. This is my  very last update regarding Nokia until $0.20 is no longer a gigantic  movement.

Shoutout to John. I just wanna help people too. Seems like I'm apparently doing it wrong but idk.

What if gamma unwinds and we see a correction? A guide to the paperhanded included.,0.82,"So you know how the market has been edging up without a large retrace ever since the November lows? A lot of this has been linked to vaccine hopes and huge amount of cash looking for tendies. Crucially, it's also linked to huge volumes of call options being bought. If a dealer/market maker (MM) sells you calls, he wants to keep the tendies without taking any risk. So to hedge the risk of selling the calls and seeing the underlying rise, he needs to hedge his risk by buying the underlying (either stocks or index futures). The # of shares he needs to buy depends on the gamma - gamma is higher when the stock price moves closer to the strike price.

If call volume increase, dealer buying of the underlying stocks also increases, further lifting the stocks. This is basically what wsb used to be about before Melvin restricted rocket rides to shares only. 

**Much words, few points, you say.** Getting to it. So what happens if a factor that has been supporting the markets suddenly weakens or completely reverses? A bear move doesn't need a lot of sellers, it just needs a lack of buying at current levels, a small correction. Dealers unwinding their positions would add to the sales and we could see a fast plunge. Add to that the record amount margin loans and you have quite the laxative cocktail. This could be ugly as fuck.

I'm eyeing the area of 3244 - 3300 on $SPX as an area of ultimate support. A massive amount of stops are sitting below that area - it's a double bottom formed in September and November. A quick plunge below these levels would probably be short lived as it would most likely be stop hunting. I don't want to tie up too much of my capital on expensive SPY puts, so I'll be looking to get some IWM puts or maybe some gourd shorts. 

**Wait, but what about BB, GME, PLTR?** The above is based on the S&P500 and options flows. A short squeeze doesn't need permission from the index or Melvin. Individual stocks don't need to follow the index 1 to 1 if there are other supporting factors. In any case, I'd be looking to add to GME in case of any pullbacks (I'm holding 100 shares of GME $19.94 + 1/21/22 10c $BB). **The fact is, corrections are common and they happen when the least amount of people expect it (**judging by the downvotes posts like these get in the last week I'd say it started on Friday). **Do not 📜 👐 your position just because of a correction. It will pass but your regrets won't once the correction is over and you see your positions mooning. Be ready for it, anticipate it. Have a plan.**

Didn't add any crayon drawings, but you can check the put to call drawings in a lot of places.

This is probably going to get downvoted to hell, but what the hell.

Foundry aggregates data from disparate systems and then allows non-technical users to combine, correlate, and chart it in many different ways. Here are how it works:

# Connect Data-Sources or upload data

Palantir uses a combination of Cassandra (for writing data quickly) and Parquet (for doing ad-hoc analysis) and SparkQL which helps do distributed data computing. I am not a data nerd, I don't understand this well, but it's much better than trying to do it yourself and getting eaten by Apache Alligators.

Enterprise users give authentication string to the Palantards, and they do either a pull or push from that data-store into Cassandra, which then writes it all over the place. Data analysis is done w/ Map-Reduce and Parquet tables to be ZOOOOOM.

I've seen people connecting p. much anything, whether it's Structued Query Language, Mongo, Comma-separated Value files (Automod didn't like the abbreviation), logs, excel spreadsheets, images, html, whatever. Can't say that it's a good idea connecting a bunch of these, but whatever we don't choose what garbage our employers like having their numbers and words in.

Anyway, data goes *PSSHHH* into Cassandra, Parquet goes *BRRR* and do SPEEDY data thing.

# Cleaning data using Blacksmith or code (Python or Apache Spark)

Okay, data is in AWS Parquet stores, but generally it sucks dick. Few examples of why it sucks:

* Country Code: US, USA, America, United States, US of A, MURIKA
* Name: Ree Tard, ReeTard, Ree, ree, Mr Ree Tard, Lord Ree\`Tard
* Date: 01/10/2021, 10th October 2021, 01/10/2021 (European though!)

So on, what this means is your data is super shit quality on ingestion. So you gotta write some code to look through all that data and make it Pristine *TM*. Nobody wants to make a chart seeing where all the retards who buy PLTR are from, and find that there are 40 variations of USA.

So you can do this with code, or something called Blacksmith. Blacksmith literally drag and drop simple web-ui click click delete garbage data, remove empty rows, format everything, replace dumb strings, etc.

Code gotta write stuff like.

       ^(?:(?:31(\/|-|\.)(?:0?[13578]|1[02]))\1|(?:(?:29|30)(\/|-|\.)(?:0?[13-9]|1[0-2])\2))(?:(?:1[6-9]|[2-9]\d)?\d{2})$|^(?:29(\/|-|\.)0?2\3(?:(?:(?:1[6-9]|[2-9]\d)?(?:0[48]|[2468][048]|[13579][26])|(?:(?:16|[2468][048]|[3579][26])00))))$|^(?:0?[1-9]|1\d|2[0-8])(\/|-|\.)(?:(?:0?[1-9])|(?:1[0-2]))\4(?:(?:1[6-9]|[2-9]\d)?\d{2})$ 

But we're all retarded so we use Blacksmith.

# Using Ontology Transformations

&#x200B;

[Palantir Ontology](https://preview.redd.it/g4dubmm6m6c61.jpg?width=1285&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28d1c6e899e6ee6e505d6359ba0d73e48c7926ff)

Okay, so you see this beauty. This is whats called a Data Ontology. The left-hand side is your data-sources, step after that is the cleaning of that degenerate excel data into pristine shit.

This is where either palantards or enterprise nerdgineers will write Python or SparkQL code to try to combine data-sets but mostly where it doesn't make sense. Business often asks synergistic process optimisation stuff like ""Hey Nerd, please correlate license plates, blood types, and Club Nintendo memberships, thanks"". I don't get it, but O+ Nintendo gamers are clearly national security threats to put an all-points bulletin out for.

Examples of use cases I know, there are plane assets, and each plane has parts, and each part has data about it's testing, and each test was performed by an engineer at a location etc. So immediate ability to determine whether any part was not validated by an engineer at any location, to improve safety for planes.

Other use case was we have an asset, that asset has these IP addresses, these vulnerability reports, these log feeds, these people owning and being accountable for it, it located in this area, it connected to these other assets and to these business processes, etc. Quick analysis of your risk posture for various computer assets.

Sounds confusing, but it makes sense if you look at it as a graph problem, and the ontology is a good visualisation for how shitty disparate data can be combined to get actionable information.

# Contour

After you get your ""I have all data in one view"" table after the ontology transformations, people need to make decisions based on it. Often having a piece of data is all well and good but good luck looking at a 100 column table and understanding it.

Enter Contour. Contours a web interface that lets you do a bunch of hectic cool data-graphing shit with no training needed. Just beep boop button click > INSIGHTS and AESTHETIC CHARTS.

You give so many options to people, that most of the time people can find a way to make whatever data they want conform to the outcome they are looking for. This is kinda useful to an enterprise, but mostly it keeps middle-management employed and happy, thus continuing to purchase additional palantir contracts and hype it up to their friends on the golf course, sponsored dinners, or businesstalk conferences. If you think that's a good thing, trust your instincts.

# Other Thoughts

Okay, so that's the gist of what Foundry is doing. Other things to note:

Forward Deployed Engineers are peeps who get shipped to workplaces worldwide and told to move excel datasheets into palantir for [250k a year](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Palantir/salaries/Software-Engineer/). Sweet gig, except it can be a mix between zero% and 120% stress level based on the retardation of the org you are working with. Since most orgs using Palantir are big enterprise, the retardation is higher than wallstreet bets and I bet you didn't think that was possible. forward deployed engineers have high turnover because they arent having fun working with weird requirements and usually take the job to get shipped to god knows where as a working holiday. They get paid better at [FANGMAN](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Facebook/salaries/Software-Engineer/) too.

Good news for Palantards is that since Palantir changes on-site employees every 3-6 months, it means nobody in the big enterprises or Palantir itself actually knows whats going on so any change and maintenance takes forever and are a consistent source of revenue.

Tech Expertise within enterprise is a sticking point too. [Banks](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Capital-One/salaries/Software-Engineer/Software-Eng/), [Government](https://apps.opm.gov/SpecialRates/2021/Table059301012021.aspx), etc don't pay big bucks for engineers compared to our FANGMANS, so the good peeps yeet off when possible. Generally, doing palantir ontology writing is literally doing plumbing except you get covered in shit always instead of occasionally. Either management asking why the transformation is taking so long (hint, 30 tables being pulled together at once is [N30 complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), no wonder it takes forever) or everything breaking from data edge cases (I can't believe we didn't think of people having a hyphenated last name???).

I know like 9 engineers hired to do palantir programming, all 9 left 3-4 months into the role to pickup literally anything else. One became an actual plumber. It means that ontologies aren't maintained and rot over time so the org needs to keep getting palantard's or new entry-level data people who leave after 3 months, aka the product sticks around forever. Bullish.

Shit is slow. They're dealing with huge data, but Cassandra and Parquet + Map-Reduce are only so effective. Especially because each org insists on their own private cloud tenancy.

Contour is good, but people can draw dumb insights from it. If you just click random buttons you can probably find a chart that looks like you can use it for whatever empire-building you're attempting. Since most users have no stats or science education, they can infer incorrectly or plainly mis-inform each other from cherry-picked data. Very bullish for middle management.

Locally, I know 6 organisations that use Palantir, 2 are banks, 4 are spooks, so that's a good sign. Palantir is very secretive about who their other clients are. Their clients at meetup events are happy to be open about where they work though. Funny that.

Once management gets used to clicking on stuff in Contour and having automated reports, they don't want it to go away or to have to learn anything else. This is why we still use Windows 20 years later. Palantir is addictive data-porn.

**TLDR**

Give an animal like 8 things to eat, animal eats it up, sacrifice the animal and look at the entrails, interpret the entrails with your confirmation bias and do random shit. Forward Deployed Shamans change identity every few moons and mostly get more food for the animals to eat. Entrails are surprisingly aesthetic and animal-sacrificing becomes addictive because of that.

GME Short Interest declined to 71M and some other explanations,0.96,"1. &#x200B;

GME short interest declined from 79.5M to 71M after Jan 15 EOD according to ORTEX estimates.

[Short Interest data left to the rightmost column(the reddit image was making trouble)](https://imgur.com/a/9D8GGO2)

[Chart of the same thing](https://imgur.com/a/cgthXrs)

Seems like the cost of borrowing has also declined very slightly for institutional investors(which is probably the more important factor as institutional investors can keep their margin requirements but the interest bleeds them).

2.

Probably the most important information, lots of ITM options had been cashed out on Friday, resulting in the ***unwinding of hedges*** by market makers. This would probably explain the price action of Friday the most; plus the profit taking by other investors. As a result, the stock sold by MMs and profit-takers were bought back by short sellers to cover their position.

**How does ORTEX get this Short Interest data?**

I have had an email exchange with ORTEX Co-founder and CTO and this is what he said, ""I have seen some question on Reddit regarding how we get the daily short interest data. And if you are interested I thought I should give you a bit of a longer explanation. The data comes from actual securities lenders, companies that facilitate the loans in stocks. They submit their lending portfolios, ie how many shares they have lent in any given stock, as well as how many stocks are available to be lent, on a daily basis. The data covers over 68 000 lending portfolios and includes over $10 trillion in availability with over $2 trillion worth of security loans per day. ""

"Don't buy $BB calls, buy $BB shares - Here's why",0.95,"I'll admit it. All this Blackberry pump got me hyped and I want to get some action too. BB has potential to moon, but I think a lot of you will still manage to lose money, because you are picking wrong strategies.

**The problem**

I know this sub is obsessed with short term OTM calls. However by buying these you are doing no justice to yourself and this community.

Let me explain. Have you ever wondered who sells you these calls? I'll tell you. Big guys and by big guys I'm talking billion dollar financial institutions that we call **market makers**. Market maker does not care which stock, what strike, how many 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 we put here - all they care about is to **make money by selling you calls.**

Market makers are very good at managing risk. Whenever they sell calls, they make sure they have the underlying stock. That way, they essentially sell **covered calls** instead of **naked calls**.

When you look at the option table, you will notice a column called **Open Interest**. It basically tells you have many option contracts are out there in the wild. Think about this as a number of retards holding these in their Robinhood account, hoping to get rich quickly.

Market makers love when there is a big hype around certain stock, especially certain strike and date. They sell these calls to you retards, and all they have to do as the expiration date nears is make sure **the stock stays below the most popular strike**, aka **strike with the most open interest**.

Why would they do that? Because they **make free money** by selling you these worthless gambling short term tickets.

How would they do this? By shorting the stock. Remember they are so big that they can afford to short the stock and suppress the price of the stock **in the short term** just in time for **your short term calls to expire worthless**.

I know some of you geniuses will tell me that market makers can't manipulate the stock in the short term; sure keep telling yourself that while you ride in your 2010 Toyota Corolla.

**You are easy targets**

Over 11,000 of you idiots, bought $12 February calls. Don't believe me? Check it yourself: [https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350903153433128967/photo/1](https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350903153433128967/photo/1)

All market makers have to do now, is make sure BB does not moon past $12 by February 19 and they are set. You lost your stimulus check money and have no means to play again.

March is even worse: [https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350910637451468801/photo/1](https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350910637451468801/photo/1). All of you piling into $15 strikes. Why are you making yourself easy targets? You are disclosing your strike and your date! What if BB moons in April? Can you sustain wasting money on these monthly calls with your minimum wage jobs?

**The solution**

Buy shares. They do not expire. There is no pressure to be right. You want to be on the 🚀 when it starts taking off, instead of being broke on the ground.

With worthless calls, no one will like you - even this sub will make funny of you.

Believe me. I've been here long enough to remember MSFT 03/21/2020 C $200 and PLTR 12/31/2020 C $30.

Buy BB shares, not short term OTM calls.",2021-01-18 06:05:01

LOW rocket ship is now re-fuelled - launch to $200 is imminent,0.73,"So listen before I get started, I get it - this is not TSLA or GME or PLTR  which are some of my favorites, but somehow our fellow autists have missed the ongoing run up of LOW. I believe there is still time to get into this trade and make some serious tendies on both cheap ass calls and stock into earnings and even past.

IT HAS BEEN UP EVERY SINGLE DAY THIS YEAR - WHY ?  STONKS ONLY GO UP.

1) Lowes announced a massive stock buy back of $15 billion dollars last month. Lowes is going to the market and buying almost 20% of all outstanding shares, that's how much money they have, think about that for a second. They don't buy back stock to lose money, they buy back to make their shareholders money by increasing the share price. 

2) Stimmy - the first round of stimmy benefited home retailer companies like LOW and HD in a massive way. Papa Joe is sending another $1400 and like it or not, many to people who don't need the money and will be going and spending on their homes with this. 

3) Interest Rates - starting to creep up and many people are rushing to refinancing their pads and renovating with extra cash, they will be going to HD and LOW for alot of this.

Here's the current chart of LOW  - as you can see it has been rocketing forward even when the market has been experiencing a bit of red this week. This is a play into earnings and maybe longer if they crush it in Q4.

BULL MARKET IS HERE AND BACK UP NEXT WEEK LETS GOOOOOOo.

Simple Palantir (PLTR) Perspective,0.95,"  Okay guys I really think Palantir has a lot of room to run over the course of the next week or so, just hear me out. Let me just start out by saying this is one opinion of a single retard on wall street bets and you should not just buy in cuz of me! Anyways here we go pigeons, on Friday 1/15/2021 Ark Invest (all hail our queen Cathie Wood) made a significant stock purchase of Palantir for the first time since initially taking a position mid-November. The Ark Invest hype train is real right now, look at other similar new investments from ARK we’ve seen significant positive price action in the weeks that follows mass quantity share purchases. Last time queen Cathie bought a significant amount of shares in PLTR we saw the stock price nearly double in the coming weeks. Now before you clowns try to call me out let me be clear, this alone is not enough to double up the stock price from current levels. BUT WAIT. DID I MENTION THERE IS MORE??

On January 26th 2021, Palantir will have a major event called “Live Demo Day” where the company will display the efficiency of its products to the world. This could be a massive short term catalyst combined with Queen Cathie’s purchase. What the hell does this tendy-lious company sell you might ask? Their products are basically Artificial Intelligence that rapidly analyzes massive quantities of data for business’s in order to improve daily operations. The more the internet scales and the more data is collected by businesses, the more demand there is for data processing. As companies scale their technological forces they often cannot keep up with processing the data to make efficient business decisions, this is where Palantir comes in. Oh and did I mention Palantir has contracts with the US Army and FDA?? Government entity partnerships are very good way to get large businesses to trust your ability to analyze data efficiently! Palantir has also been processing vaccine trial data to look for patterns, this opens the door to pharmaceutical companies pursuing partnerships in the future as they observe what significance Palantir has in gathering Covid vaccine data. It also appears to become more and more common for businesses to need data processing to make better business decisions as the internet scales. So what the fuck is my point? This is a great story for investors to buy into and is exactly the kind of thing that can get the hype train going. IN MY OPINION, three very powerful words. In my opinion, Demo day is very similar to an event like Tesla battery day where significant progress in the business model is on display a provides investors of a vision of where the company is heading. And if there’s anything I’ve learned in 2020, vision fucking matters.

The fact the company went public through a Direct public offering rather than an initial public offering can prove to be significant, allow me to explain. Direct public offerings’ tend to not get as much hype upon listings compared to Initial public offerings. Now I know you clowns reading this thinking BuT LoOk HoW mUcH tHe StOnK hAs MoOnEd AlReAdY. But consider this, look at how Snowflake, Doordash, and other various IPO’s have absolutely skyrocketed on their opening trading days and they were all backed by major underwriters. Since (PLTR) was a direct public offering I personally believe the true hype is not entirely baked into this stock. Instead it has slowly been noticed and demo day is a fantastic opportunity for the world to hear Palantir’s story and finally really understand the long term vision and the profitable scalability business opportunity they have. Demo day, in case you can’t connect the dots, DEMO-nstrates Palantir’s product lineup of artificial intelligence. Regardless of what we actually see from the products there will for sure be a lot of hype about the potential of these products.  

Palantir Counter Arguments:

Lockup Period Expiry: The lockup period ends mid-February shortly after earnings are reported. The lockup period could go either way, but if the employees believe in the company they will hold a majority of their shares are they have first hand vision of what’s unfolding for Palantir. Can’t stomach the risk of the lock up period? No worries this is still a month away and there’s plenty of time to get in and out of this stock before the lockup expiry even becomes a relative issue.

Last ER showed significant losses: A majority of losses last earnings report were a result of direct listing regulatory fees! These fees are not recurring, they were one time fees to take the company public. Considering this is a tech company, operating costs tend to be low and generally consistent. Therefore, as revenue scales, profit margins should theoretically soar along with it over the long term.  Again, earnings are a month out so if you cannot stomach the risk of a bad earnings report you can still sell out prior to this. 

All in all, my point is this. Short term catalysts could really start to push this stock upwards to new all-time highs this week into next leading up to Demo day. And for long term consideration, any dips over the next couple months could be fantastic buying opportunities. Only time will tell. Just remember I am not a financial advisor you fucking pigeon. But with that being said the risk/reward long term is quiet enticing when you look at what this company is trying to do. I hope I at least got this at the top of your watch list after writing all this crap, clearly I’m bullish as fuck short term and long term. Cya on the m00n autists.

These two boys **made HSR filings + a request for early termination** (that was granted). For those of you who don't know what this means:

HSR filings are required (amongst a couple of other requirements) when someone is making an acquisition of >$94m (this is the rate for the past year in 2020. will likely hike somewhere to \~$100m in 2021). This is what we saw with Mithril when they bought a fuck ton of shares in December ([https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/premerger-notification-program/early-termination-notices/20210675](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/premerger-notification-program/early-termination-notices/20210675))

**Early termination requests are made to bypass the customary 30-day waiting period when someone makes an HSR filing.** This implies that the individual wants to make a purchase in less than 30 days. Both of the early termination requests were granted. Karpy and Cohen are either buying leading up to demo day/the assumed (HOPEFULLY) price hike we see, or, maybe, right around lockup expy time.

I'd leave another thicc rocket for you fuckers, but mods keep auto-deleting the post because of the image.

***#1 Targeted Ads***

Ads and articles are both paid for by someone.The fact that in the past 3 weeks i've been getting multiple multiple targeted ads on my phone related to PLTR since i love PLTR so much.

Ads are telling me that PLTR is bad, doesn't provide a dividend, they're telling me PLTR's fair price is 20 instead of 25 based on some financial model and have gone as far as to provide a list of alternative stocks to buy.

To me, this all screams: **SCARE TACTICS**

Additionally, the last few weeks of ups and downs in PLTR's stock price is another indication of the attempts to short the stock to sh!t and drive investors out. (For what reason? I don't know.)

&#x200B;

***#2 Shilling PLTR***

I myself love to shill PLTR to people whenever i can. I do this because i legitimately think this company will do great. I work as a product manager in a software development house and understand what PLTR does. PLTR is not cryptic.Regardless, i think when people shill PLTR to you, they are right to do so as you're probably missing out on a great opportunity to make money in the long run. If you're looking for big gains short term, maybe try something else.

Shillery is OK, but at least give the facts.

&#x200B;

***#3 Last Quarter's Bad Financials***

If you'd done your DD not by searching reddit posts but by checking PLTR's actual quarterly report, you'd know that PLTR's ""bad"" last financial quarter/earnings were due to the costs of listing themselves on the *New York Stock Exchange*.\~855million were spent on listing and stock related compensations and this is the big reason.

**Direct quote by PLTR here:** [https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)

>We incurred a loss from operations of $847.8 million, which includes $847.0 million in stock-based compensation following our recent direct listing.

I would like to remind everyone that this is a **1 TIME THING.** Put simply, this means that PLTR won't have as excessive losses next quarter as they did this last quarter.

*Additionally*, let me go into further detail on this and not just leave it to that.

* ***PLTR's quarterly operating expenses for the past 3 quarters were at around \~260 million.***
* ***PLTR's operating expenses this quarter were \~987 million.***

ADDITIONALLY...

PLTR also had a higher R&D cost this quarter that just passed. Normally they'd pay 80 million on R&D, but somehow ended up paying \~300 million this quarter. No one knows why, but this is another thing that influenced PLTR's earnings.

[https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)

>On September 30, 2020, in connection with the Direct Listing, we incurred $769.5 million and $8.4 million of stock-based compensation using the accelerated attribution method related to the satisfaction of the performance-based vesting condition for RSUs and growth units, respectively, that had satisfied the service-based vesting condition as of such date.

&#x200B;

***#4 PLTR financials moving forwards***

PLTR is deep in bed with the government and the Biden regime although may look like it would be against using PLTR is in fact secretly very pro-surveillance e.g pro Palantir.

Here's some of the known organizations in the US Govt that use PLTR:

1. CDC
2. Office of the Secretary
3. Food and Drug Administration
4. Immigration and Customs Enforcements / ICE
5. Internal Revenue Service / IRS
6. National Institute on Drug Abuse
7. DOD/ARMY - ACC Aberdeen Proving Ground
8. Coast Guard / DHS
9. DOD/NAVY - Naval Information Warfare Systems Command
10. US Attorney's Offices / DOJ
11. US Special Operations Command / SPEC OPS

Boys. The big institutional people know these things. You just found this out. See how deep PLTR is already in bed with the Government?????? Palantir IS the next Raytheon/Lockheed of DATA aggregation and visualization.

***UPCOMING EARNINGS***

I've done some quick maths and it looks like PLTR is more likely to be in positive earnings this quarter and with a 0.02 cent EPS target, we can easily assume that they'll destroy this with maybe 0.04 or 0.08 EPS. In the worst case scenario, PLTR's EPS this quarter could be somewhere around MINUS -0.05 ish due to interview costs and ad/campaigning costs that were not there before the company was listed.

***WHAT CAN DESTROY PALANTIR***

Now, there's big possible downsides and Palantir can fail IF contracts that expire are not renewed. That's biggest REAL reason for Palantir's balance sheet getting screwed.

I've seen a disturbing pattern with PLTR's financials and that's that every year, it's R&D cost is rising by between 150 and 350 million dollars. This is quite a bit of negative revenue and if new contracts are not constantly coming in, PLTR's balance can start going into the negative.

***WHAT WILL NOT DESTROY PALANTIR***

Some people may have concerns over the new left leaning government dumping PLTR. An article was posted that is behind a paywall EVERYWHERE that goes something like this:

[https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker)

In my opinion, i believe this is inconsequential and that a few people crying to daddy Biden to kill a multimillion contract with PLTR is a stretch. Also we know the current new Biden team has his hands full and will have them full for at least the next 1 year with what's going on.

There is no time to deal with a few crybabies and even if he did deal with it and did decide to kill the PLTR Tiberius Covid tracker contract with the CDC which he WONT, these things take months and years to deal with, and by then the contract/s will have already brought PLTR tons of money and revenue in.

***HOW MUCH DOES KARP AND HIS GOONS GET PAID***

Short answer is... A LOT. The amounts below are PER YEAR. That's a lot of money in the hole and contributes to annoying amount to why PLTR is always just at the edge of just barely being profitable.

https://preview.redd.it/ba58nqcurob61.png?width=2615&format=png&auto=webp&s=55d45833faad4d60ea8dc142a9601c44b4cc7395

Palantir's prospectus 311 page document's 130 last pages are almost all exclusively talking about extremely complicated options trading schemes that are made by Cohen and others to make sure they can squeeze out a LOT of money out of PLTR.

Mithril Investments has existed from before and is not a new company. Owned by Thiel/Cohen/Karp as a way to launder and exchange options for more options and more money for all 3 of them. Also Shyam Sankar to me feels corrupt which scares me a bit, he's had some very shady dealings and has brought his wife in PLTR that gets paid 200k per year.

Prospectus Document: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm)

I suggest you skim through it, it contains EVERYTHING about Palantir.

**Palantir is going to need to have to be getting AT LEAST 500 million in NEW contracts per year to REMAIN BARELY profitable. It's doable in my opinion, but just barely and it's why they made the company public to try and get more people's attention and increase the inflow of contracts.**

&#x200B;

***#5 Soros and his 21 million shares***

First of all, i think we can all agree that Soros can suck it.

If you've read a few articles here and there, you'll know that Soros owns/owned 1% of Class A PLTR shares. No one knows whether he's sold them yet or if he's an DPO holder who'll sell 3 days after February's earnings.

Whether he sells them or buys more will be mostly inconsequential in my opinion. We see dips and pumps every day. He legally cannot sell his shares all at once, he'll have to sell certain amounts daily and over time. This will create annoying sideways motion as shares exchange hands and consolidation starts for 2-3 weeks until his and insider shares exchange hands.

Nothing special to see here, move along just a little draw down resulting in some consolidation.

PLTR is exposed to OIL more than anything, so fluctuations in the general market and general market crashes affect PLTR much less than other stocks. Also PLTR does not track ANY benchmarks. NONE.

&#x200B;

***#6 DPO expiry 3 days after earnings in February***

To my limited knowledge, this is how BIG plays who are holding DPO shares usually work:

* If a stock has performed well up to earnings and investors are more than happy with the returns, they're more likely to not sell their stock or just sell less than they normally would.
* If a stock hasn't performed as well as investors thought, these investors are more likely to sell stock or reduce their positions more than normal.

There's a total of 1.16Billion Class A PLTR shares currently (Give or take don't flog me). We are currently trading with \~250 million shares while the rest are locked away in the DPO.

When those shares are ""unlocked"" in February, the price of the stock won't be diluted. These shares already exist and are accounted for. They are simply locked. Also when they are unlocked, the share price won't simply multiply because all shares are now tradeable.

>According to [Palantir’s after-hours filing with the SEC this afternoon](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520257973/d89036dex991.htm), the company has 1.16 billion Class A shares, 484 million Class B shares and 1 million Class F shares on its cap table outstanding today, or a total of roughly 1.64 billion. Only Class A shares will trade, and Class B and F shares are convertible to Class A shares on a one-to-one basis. On a fully diluted basis, which Palantir says represents 2.2 billion shares total according to its most recent S-1 filing, the company is valued at $16 billion. The difference between those two aggregate numbers comes from outstanding stock performance grants, warrants and other financial instruments.

What **WILL** affect stock price:

* Employees exercising their non class A options into Class A shares. This IS dilution.
* The bigwigs e.g Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a few other bigshots exercising their options and then selling them for a profit.

*To note, regular employees will barely affect the price of the stock with their miniscule share holdings. Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a handful of other high ranked executives in PLTR are the ones that will create a tiny but manageable ripple in the stock price.*

What **COULD** affect the stock price a lot:

* Massive sell off by the big institutional holders.
* Not shorters. (Citron and Citi can suck it, we're in control here)
* People with weak spaghetti wet paper hands.
* Everyone fomoing the same weeklies e.g like when everyone bought Jan 15 calls on everything.
* Big but silent scare campaign (that's already going on) to scare off normies like us.

&#x200B;

***#7 What does PLTR do, tldr.***

Imagine Facebook's database of everything about everyone & Youtube's Database of everything & Geolocation data in a database made by the US Army for known terrorist cells.

Palantir allows you to select and match varied data TYPES from several different database, combine it in any way you want and visualize it so that it's human readable by even the dumbest person in the room so that even they can see patterns and come to conclusion on a subject matter.

It's kind of like filling an excel sheet with data and then visualizing it with a bar chart, except the date you filled the sheet with can be anything and not just numbers or dates or countries and you can make various combinations using all the different rows of data to maybe come up with a pattern to something like how to best distribute the Covid vaccines in the counties in a very specific state in the US.

Literally what you see in SciFi movies where people combine random data by smashing keys on a keyboard and somehow find the murderer, the location of a terrorist or the percentage that someone will commit a murder in the future based on a lot of random data about that person or the area, country, family, history... anything.

While this all might sound super cool and amazing, it is. Maybe in 10 years time there will be a few more companies doing this, but for now, it's only Palantir, Circles, Alteryx and a few other private entities that do this type of thing. Many of them work with governments and are hush hush due to the kinds of things they use this type of software for (terrorist cells, warzones, etc) and the public backlash this could cause.

tldr: Glorified data aggregator and visualization platform/software with different access levels for different people.

**PLTR is superbly positioned to offer their software to SLOW and Boomer like organizations like Governments.**

Governments are stupid and don't have neither the time, nor technical knowledge to develop this software themselves for internal use. This is what PLTR capitalizes on and why Governments use them so much.

Governments could have spent the a fraction of the money they spend on PLTR contracts to make the software themselves but only for their own internal systems and use, but they can't and if they tried, they'd fail because technocracy in governments is not a thing. By the time they'd even complete a project like this, it'd likely be out of spec, unusable and would require further development and money and we know how slow and bad governments are at doing even the basics. Again PLTR wins because of this.

**PLTR is likely NOT** to be adopted by giants like Google or FB or other modern tech organizations of any size because they are not stupid. They have their own purpose built internal systems that they use to do everything related to data aggregation and visualization because they have the technical knowledge and resources. Buying PLTR for their use is a joke.

PLTR capitalizes on being general a general purpose tool and is set up manually by an engineer over the course of 4-10 days for each customer. The engineer customizes and configures the system for each company's custom use since the software allows you to do so. Regular aggregation and visualization software CAN do the same, but typically lacks data input types and features that PLTR has because PLTR has cultivated a special set of features over many years that were suggested by their existing clientele in battlefields and other places.

Now friends, here's my position on PLTR. I'll be holding onto it for the next year. If it's not at least 300% by then, i'm selling it and moving on to the next stock. App i'm using is Revolut.

Also yes, i'm ALL-IN only on Palantir because i know my money will multiply itself in the short term. I'm not holding this till 2025 as others are supposedly doing. I'm selling in 2022 with 300% or more profit. PLTR is severely undervalued, underpriced because it's a DPO. Give it till EOY and we're going to be rich. If it was an IPO it'd be trading at 180+ already imho.

I've spent the last month and a half holding PLTR. I've gone full schizzo mode when it comes to PLTR. I lose sleep daily and i love it. I hadn't slept for 37 hours a few days ago because i spent so much time researching PLTR and scraping the internet for all possible information.

I come from an IT/Development background, so i understand what PLTR does completely.

My PT's for PLTR are:

* 48-89 by March or April.
* 75 - 125 by EOY.
* 200+ 2022 IF they solve their income and constantly increasing R&D cost issues.

Palantir Technologies ($PLTR) has some MAJOR catalyst approaching. Don’t miss out like you did with $GME,0.9,"Yesterday we ended the day on a 3% gain, albeit this was a 10%+ gain at some points but the market went red as a whole so this is understandable. Regardless, there’s a number of reasons to be loading up on SHARES before the 🚀 takes off.

1. Institutional’s are loading up on PLTR prior to the major catalysts (ARK recently upped their stake by 497,100 shares and so did another number of firms).

2. Demo Day: 26th of Jan we’ll see PLTR do a demonstration day of their main product offerings. This will undoubtedly draw attention and traction to the stock as people better understand the recent standardisation of PLTR’s software. This standardisation is what has enabled them to target over 6,000 large institution/enterprise customers across all verticals. Ultimately this will show their commercial viability outside of what they’re known for (governmental contracts) and will result in a stock uptick due to their future viability.

3. Earnings Day: Early February we shall see PLTR’s earnings report for Q420. This should also cover some of the forward-looking aspects of it’s recently acquired contracts alongside projections. If you are unaware of those contracts, see the link here: [LINK](https://investors.palantir.com/home/default.aspx)

As Palantir will most likely pass $1bn in revenue, this is likely to be a big day.


4. Lockup period: Employees and the like are able to liquidate some of their positions come mid February. This has obvious negative connotations to it but for the most part what most people don’t understand is that there will only be a minuscule amount of shares which will be CASHED in. Employees will not cash in all their shares as they will also notice and realise the growth potential of their stock options. They will maybe cash in a small amount if needed but the firm has just began properly marketing their product and concentrating on business development, employees and us alike know the growth potential of this stock.

Once a lower-than-anticipated amount of stock is liquidated, this will most likely have an inverse effect. People will realise that this dip won’t happen and there will be a scrambled influx to buy in. Most likely driving the stock up and pushing it to ATH (unless we have another Citi downgrade bcos IBs love a bit of MM).


That’s all.

TLDR; Buy PLTR shares NOT calls for the time being or you will see beautiful 🚀🚀🚀 and realise you have missed out on the next $GME / $TSLA",2021-01-16 12:10:11

GME Margin Requirement & Margin Call Explanation For Noobs,0.96,"I have seen lot's of question on  Margin Requirements and  confusion  surrounding  it and wanted to clarify it as lot's of information is wrong.  

Margin Requirements effect's both longs and shorts. It effects longs only if shares have been bought on margin and the account is overleveraged, like a true retard like me.  I think because of this lot of shares were also sold today, because the brokerage forced selling.  

Whats an Margin Account ?  (Info From Fidelity) 

A margin account lets you leverage securities you already own as collateral for a loan to buy additional securities. 

What's a Margin Requirement 

Margin requirements tell you how much equity you must have in your account to cover what you’re buying (or what you hold) on margin. The requirements are determined 

1. Federal Requirement . Default Value is 50 percent . Means for 10k account I can only leverage 5k more. For a total account of 15k.  
2. Exchange Requirement . Exchange Requirement is 25 percent 
3. Broker Requirement.   Ranges from 30-100 percent 

I will explain this using my Margin Account.    Below is the my margin  account and the house call which I almost got fucked with. Had to deposit 27k to cover it. 

&#x200B;

[My Margin Account as of 1\/16\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/o3g6us2tsmb61.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b6bb9ff56625dca063860c3f741f7647f47428c)

&#x200B;

On 1/14/2021 the requirement for GME on Fidelity was 40 percent.  

  

|Number Of Shares|Total Value |Requirement Amount (40%)|Leverage Amount|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|3000|51,000|20,4000|30,600|

Like I true retard I used this 30,600 to buy other shares in the above screenshot.  I bought PLTR, GOEV etc.   

On 1/15/2021 the requirement for GME on Fidelity was changed to 65 percent.  Suddenly the leverage amount dropped for me from 30k to 17k.  Creating a short fall of 12.5k . As I was leveraged to tits I got a email from fidelity regarding this.  I got saved by rising GME price. 

&#x200B;

|Number Of Shares|Total Value |Requirement Amount (65%)|Leverage Amount|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|3000|51,000|33,150|17,850|

&#x200B;

[1\/14](https://preview.redd.it/0wxo93d2vmb61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=c271ec4efdcb11e3fbf25c28b257bf6860570289)

  

Thankfully price of GME rose from 20 to 31 which increased my total account value and helped in avoiding margin call.  

&#x200B;

On 1/15/2021 Fidelity and others increase there margin requirement to 85 percent or 100 percent in case of schawb. Suddenly all longs holding shares in margin account and tits leveraged and shorts are fucked.   I was suddenly down 17,850-7650 =10,200k. I got a house call/margin call.  As 1/15 was a bear day and my other stocks lost money suddenly I was in red of 23k. 

&#x200B;

|Number Of Shares|Total Value |Requirement Amount (65%)|Leverage Amount|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|3000|51,000|43,350|7650|

 In case of Margin call people have two options to either deposit $ or sell securities. 

I am depositing 27k to cover this shortfall if not I would sell some GOEV and NVAX to cover the shortfall.  In short people have opportunity to cover there margin call and the account is liquidated only when the call is not met or the broker decides the trade is retarded and sell it himself.  

&#x200B;

TLDR : Margin Requirement will cause both long and short to cover and it will also cause some longs who are leveraged to tits to sell the stocks.   This will effect shorts more as they are even more fucked than a long.  

Remember to   💎 ✋ and GME will 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",2021-01-16 06:08:12
Papa Cohen and his raging hard on to make change,0.97,"Not a shitpost, I promise boys. Hear me out on this DD.

Ryan Cohen is all in on GME. From the jump, he has been committed to turning Gamestop into the Amazon of games. He has a throbbing raging hard on to blow GME to the fucking moon. He shitposts on his Twitter about Blockbuster and Jim Cramer. GME is forcing T-rex dinosaur looking wrinkly tapioca pudding eating old fucks off the board. RC is a fellow autist.

But more importantly boys: He's a fucking billionaire. He bought 550 Million dollars of Tesla last year.

GME has 71 Million shares and Papa Cohen can exercise purchase of 7% to up his ownership. That's roughly 5 million shares. 5 Million X $36 is 180 Million. Why would he not spend 1/3 of what he spent on tesla on his own vision? Why the FUCK would Papa Cohen not suck up the rest of his entitled shares to throw green dildos at the shorts. He's an activist and believes in the mission. He can afford it.

I believe we will see news over the long weekend (the perfect catalyst) to increase his %. This would be the ultimate dick slam in the faces of Melvin, Wallstreet, and all the gay bears.

**Listen here you paper hand having bastards. If you cant get handle the ride, you're in the wrong place. I want you to sell your BB, NIO, and PLTR and go to the nearest home improvement store. Buy a shovel. Dig 150 kilometers to the earth's mantle and stick your tiny little girly hands into this beautiful melting earth we call home. Your hands will develop into diamonds and you will emerge a true retard autist surrounded by the glow of DFV.**

As we march forth toward the rocket ship launchpad, we will be applauded by all of those that have fallen before us. Think about the college savings account you emptied that keeps you from looking your sweet children in their eyes. Think about that stupid fucking Tom that bothers you at work every day about his magic the gathering collection. Think about the true Chad that your wife is fucking.

It is time to rise from the ashes of your failed YOLO attempts and become true champions in the eyes of our lord and savior, Papa Ryan Cohen. On this battlefield, he will stand with us and deliver gain porn that we will all be able to fap to for years to come as we munch on our tendies. Hold, Buy, Cum, but do not sell. Eat your tendies with me and rejoice as we become the first 1.9 Million person spaceflight to the moon.

Edit: Literally think about the story. 35-year-old uber-successful business-minded big dick having RC comes into the most recognized gaming brand in history and turns it around. within a month, the market cap of the company increases 4 fold and he saves 55K jobs. Fucking come on guys who wouldn't want to make that happen? The kid knows what he's doing, he's held his tongue to watch the puts expire today.

It's time to prepeare for PALANTIR ($PLTR) 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 (indepth),0.94,"While I've been participating with $GME (LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTION!) and getting aboard the $BB train to the MOON  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

I think that it's time to slowly invest into or continually investing for pure GAINS

We know that Cathie Wood's ARK Next Generation Internet ETF bought 497,100 shares of Palantir.

link: [https://www.thestreet.com/investing/palantir-pltr-stock-ark-next-generation-internet-etf](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/palantir-pltr-stock-ark-next-generation-internet-etf)

&#x200B;

With Palantir opening a contract with the military and the government we can see that Woods is trying to invest more of the company into her Index ETF

&#x200B;

So what makes you think that Palantir stocks will go up fairly soon? 3 catalysts

1. **Announced in Dec. 17th Demonstration Day (link provided) ON JANURAY 26TH**

Will be showing off their AI Software; Gotham, Foundry, Apollo

[https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Announces-Inaugural-Live-Demo-Day-on-January-26-2021/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Announces-Inaugural-Live-Demo-Day-on-January-26-2021/default.aspx)  we'll see  what they have to offer which should beef up their stock for a bit

&#x200B;

2.**Palantir will be announcing their Q4 Earnings date around FEB 11th** 

which should show how well they're doing

&#x200B;

3. **There is a share lock-up** (meaning that a lot 60-80% of their shares are owned by insiders, CEOs, employees, etc) which means that we'll see that ends probably around mid-February where we can see a giant dip due to those people selling their shares for the profits they've seen from the market

&#x200B;

However, after that happens I do believe that the prices will float back up by March/April

&#x200B;

Watch this video if you didn't understand

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiKi4qIJ2sg&t=208s&ab\_channel=saltypeanuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiKi4qIJ2sg&t=208s&ab_channel=saltypeanuts)

&#x200B;

Prediction; pick up Palantir stocks and watch them go up before/after their demonstration I would say prepare calls around (27.5 - 29c)  for the week of 29TH  and around Feb 11th.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Once the lockup period happens I'm sure we'll see some dips and that'll be more chances to buy into the dip as well as redo more options

$LMT is going to 🚀 to the 🌙,0.73,"1. $LMT is in $ARKQ and Cathie added to the position this week on the same day she bought some in $PLTR
2. $LMT will (very likely) be in $ARKX as it is one of the biggest players in the Space Industry and they have some of the most experienced talent. 
3. They have extremely strong ties with NASA and the government. The US will make sure it’s part of any insanely lucrative space business such as mining of valuable minerals from asteroids.
4. There is 25% upside just to get back to recent highs from Feb 2020.
5. Excuse the fundamentals, but they have a P/E ratio of less than 15.
6. People think this is some boomer stock so the IV is super low meaning low premiums on reasonable strikes for FDs and leaps.

PLTR seems like an obvious bet!.. looking at a pump to $60🚀,0.81,"Bought PLTR at $14.20. PT: $60

Some of these points confuse me about what ya'll are doing:

1. Here is a company, about to pivot the fuckin foundation of how businesses strategize and make big buck decisions, and ya'll putting your bucks into GME and BB? Obvious cue ignored.
2. The real big bucks are flowing towards Palantir with long/short term million dollar contracts.. and ya'll bought BB out of the grave.
3. Citron punched PLTR first, then came Credit Sussie, then Morgan Stanley.... recently Citi... and ya'll had to show them your paper hands. PLTR is a diamond which needs the same. Big guys trying to downplay the stock till the next financials come in. Thats where they get in, and you keep watching the stock price go up. Obvious cue ignored.
4. Just like TSLA is backed by a CEO trying to change world conventions of commuting, energy and space travel. PLTR is the revolution of how corporations would strategize and optimize their existing pipelines! Still ya'll selling shares and buying puts. Obvious cue ignored.
5. Ya'll profited big time out of GME and BB. But, do you really even consider or plan to stay? Doesn't PLTR look like an obvious place to dump your gains?
6. Specifically for you ""simple men"" looking for 🚀- Alex Karp's entire life makes papa Musk's dance look normal.. and ya'll putting your bucks into GME and BB? Isn't Alex Karp's hair style enough for you to YOLO your life savings into PLTR?

Here is a company which is skyrocketing off of skyrocketting other companies and ya'll pumping GME and BB?

TL;DR - Confused about where the bucks are flowing. Obvious explicit and implicit cues point straight towards PLTR🚀🚀. Simple as 1 + 1. Yet you guys pumping GME and BB?

$SRNE to the moon (again) 🚀,0.88,"First-time poster here, but I've been lurking since about September. Y'all brought me tendies in the form of GME and PLTR plays in the past couple months, so I thought it was my turn to repay the favor with some DD on a company that I haven't seen posted about on here yet. This isn’t a short-squeeze opportunity or an ARK darling that’s up 100% in the past year. The play here is Sorrento Therapeutics ($SRNE). SRNE is a biotech company which specializes in researching the use of stem-cells for cancer treatments, as well as non-opiod pain relief treatments. However, if you recognize the name, its more likely due to their developing pipeline of COVID-19 offerings. Since the outbreak began in March, SRNE has applied their resources and existing competencies to developing treatments and testing kits to combat the pandemic. In addition to their ongoing cancer and pain relief projects, they have 11 potential COVID-19 related products in various stages of the pipeline. You can view everything that they are working on here:

[https://sorrentotherapeutics.com/research/pipeline/](https://sorrentotherapeutics.com/research/pipeline/)

Essentially, this company is working on projects to combat cancer, the opioid epidemic, and, oh yeah the global pandemic that has dominated the planet for almost a year now. There is massive demand in all of these areas for new solutions, and Sorrento could be one of the organizations that solves part of the problem. 

Needless to say, SRNE has a lot going on in its labs at the moment. However, each one of these projects represents a potential catalyst for the stock price. For example, the stock jumped almost 200% on May 15th when the company announced that one of their antibody treatments was 100% effective in inhibiting the virus in early testing. (I was holding 450 shares @ 3.15 that I had purchased purely out of excitement for their cancer and pain relief work. I was more than happy to dump them at $10.2 during pre-market on May 18th 😌)

[https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sti-1499-potent-anti-sars-cov-2-antibody-demonstrates-ability](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sti-1499-potent-anti-sars-cov-2-antibody-demonstrates-ability)

Then in August, the share price climbed to a peak of $20, apparently on pure speculation. These two examples demonstrate that this stock has a ton of interest in any news or releases on the COVID front, which arguably isn’t even its main business. The share price has been volatile since August, moving within the $5-12 range over the past 5 months.

**The reason I am writing this post now** is because the stock is up about 20% today, again with no news as of this posting. On December 22nd, the company filed an application for an Emergency Use Authorization for their rapid-test product with the FDA. This is where I think the real money is there to be made. They missed the boat on the vaccine race, but there is still a huge need for improved testing, which in the past has been inefficient and inaccurate. SRNE’s COVI-STIX can reportedly deliver results in 2-15 minutes. With widespread availability of this testing, we could even get back to sporting events and concerts, as testing could be done quickly at the gates of the arena, and any positive cases would be turned away and refunded. SRNE is also working on a rapid spit-test, which would eliminate the need to have a q-tip rammed into your brain.

News on the potential approval of COVI-STIX is imminent, which could further send the stock price higher in the short-term. 20% would only be the first step on this moon mission, as no real news has even been released yet. It's also possible that the jump we saw today could be pure speculation and the price will fall back into the $7-8 range next week and stay there until actual news is released. I'm not saying buy or don't buy right now, but I wanted to get this DD out here before the stock really moons. Just wanted to give everyone a chance to read into this company over the long weekend.

Regardless of this short-term spike, the play here is the sheer number of possible catalysts in their pipeline at the moment. The stock currently trades at a $2.6B market cap, which leaves room for a huge move upwards. The company has increased their cash while lowering debt in the last year, meaning they should be in no danger of going under in the near term. They generated $28M in revenue in the first 9 months of 2020 from their one existing product, and this revenue could double if they get any of their new products approved.

SRNE closed at $9.50 today, but the **average 1-yr estimate on this company is $25**, which in my view is completely attainable if any of their products attain FDA approval and make it to the market.

If you're looking for any other reasons to get on the SRNE train, the company has a CEO in Dr. Henry Ji who publicly hates shorts as much as we all do.

*""I am giving them a fair warning shot. Just cover yourself, don't ruin your family,"" Ji said of short sellers who he says are trying to manipulate Sorrento's stock.*

[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/26/sorrento-therapeutics-opened-up-117-after-ceo-slam/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/26/sorrento-therapeutics-opened-up-117-after-ceo-slam/)

(Seriously, with the amount of hype around this stock, it takes almost nothing to move it double-digit percentage points)

Even after this declaration back in August, there are still 68M shares sold short as of 12/31/20. It's not GME level short interest, but it would accelerate the rockets if any big approval news is released.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/srne/short-interest](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/srne/short-interest)

I'm not as experienced with options trading as most of you are, but if you want to buy calls I would buy them at least a few months out. The news that could send this stock up 100% is likely imminent, but it will be impossible to predict its timing since we are dealing with FDA approval here. It could be next week, it could be in March. My guess is as good as yours. I wouldn't buy any weeklies or FD's and expect to hit it big. If you like what you read here, take some of your GME profits and buy a few shares and hold on till this baby hits $20+

As always, do your own research into the stock before throwing your money at it.

**Positions:** Too dumb for options so I'm holding 500 boomer shares at $7.21.

**TLDR:** Biotech company with over a dozen potential COVID/Cancer/Pain Relief products in various stages of FDA approval process. Potential EUA approval for rapid COVID testing product sometime in the next month = 🚀. CEO hates shorts. Buy shares or longer-term options to ensure that you are holding when any news hits.

Tomorrow’s best play.,0.96,"Of course it’s $PLTR, it’s always $PLTR.

Why? Well, because there’s a special someone with the Midas touch; Cathie Wood. Anything this woman touches turns to gold, as if $PLTR wasn’t already. Not only has ARK been consistently purchasing $PLTR since it’s DPO but just yesterday she happened to purchase another 500,000 shares. Why would someone do that for an analyst rated stock at $15? That’s because Citigroup is one of the lowest institutional shareholders on the board. Yet they never sold any of their shares even after the valuation they gave? That’s what you call legal market manipulation, and if you didn’t know they were trying to get a lower buy in. However, Cathie has once again saved us all.

Here’s the play: Theres a huge amount of short puts expiring tomorrow 1/15, and now every single one of those puts are OTM and will expire worthless. This is the best opportunity to double down on all shares if you don’t already own, I definitely recommend getting in now. If everyone is on board with the same mindset, this is the 2021 shit show I had mentioned in my previous post. Tomorrow is the day, and I promise that even on a 10%+ premarket for PLTR, it is still a great buy. I say this because half the people in my last post were comments about “Am I too late to get in?” No, you’re not. You just had a better opportunity to make even more, except there’s still more to be made. Inaugural rocketship 🚀.

Here’s a little more in depth about reasons to buy PLTR in the most simplest form because I know how retarded some of you are.

1: PLTR DPO’d, not IPO’d. What the fuck does that mean? It means it gave every single one of us a chance to buy the stock at an extremely low price because institutional investors didn’t get the chance to bid the stock price up like with a traditional IPO. Think of DoorDash or AirBnB, two IPO’s that debuted at an absurdly high price. That’s normal for IPO’s, which is what happened with one of PLTR’s competitors, $SNOW. Go look at their current price and do the math, similar company with a fraction of the amount of contracts that PLTR has but has a higher stock price. DPO’s are something Institutional Investors hate, because retail investors (us) get to make the money instead of them, which is why they downgrade the stock in order to get lower buy-ins.

2: Cathie Wood. Like I said earlier, she has the Midas touch. She will literally carry us to the moon if it’s the last thing she does, and this is just the beginning.

3: HUGE presentation on 1/26, that’s literally 12 days away. This presentation will showcase PLTR’s tech and give a better representation of what they really do since people don’t seem to know. (They’re the TOP of data collection, surveillance, etc. and have been doing this for 17 years.) Not only that but this presentation will have earning reports, which we all know are way above the predicted numbers.

4. Tons of contracts already signed, and continually adding more almost weekly. They even have deals with the US Army. Are you fucking kidding me?

5. Lockup. Now you’d think that lockup means that PLTR stock will go down, which is possible and doesn’t matter because the short squeeze happens before the lockup ends either way. BUT this is more than just a squeeze, because lockup doesn’t mean that the price will necessarily go down. It’ll undoubtedly go up even more before this because insiders want to capitalize on as much money as possible when they’re allowed to sell their shares again. No one wants to sell at $25 when they can double that. Another reason why lockup CAN be a good thing is because it allows institutional investors to get back into the stock, with a much higher volume surfacing it gives them the chance to purchase FAT amounts of shares rather than minimal amounts like currently. There’s only 20% of shares floating right now, and retail investors own 60% of that 20%, so institutions can’t really buy anything right now. Which is why it’s been sideways for so long. 

TL;DR: PLTR is going to rocket like crazy the next week or two, tomorrow is the beat day to perform a huge squeeze and fuck shorts over since Cathie Wood has just purchased 500k shares even after a downgrade by analysts. I really recommend you read this post, I’ve dumbed it down quite a lot.

POS: I’m now at 700 shares @25.52, never sold my calls that expire tomorrow because I had faith even though they were down 70%, but are already passed BEP in after-hours. Will be up huge tomorrow. 1/15 26c, 1/15 27c, 1/22 25.5c, 1/22 28c.

EDIT: PLEASE just buy shares, calls are extremely high theta with PLTR and are painful to watch. Shares and hold.

Why PLTR stock price is gonna skyrocket up...,0.92,"Hey y'all, this is my first DD, so forgive me if I mess something up. I'm gonna explain to y'all why PLTR stock is about to go to the moon. 

First of all, what is Palantir? Palantir is a company that builds digital infrastructure for data-driven operations and decision-making. The software developed is later licensed to companies which then allow them to make data-driven decisions, conduct intricate analysis, and make their operations even more efficient and productive. 

Palantir was founded back in 2003, and they've been working extremely close with agencies and sectors of the US government (examples include security, healthcare, defense, etc.) Palantir is so balls deep in US operations that it's extremely unlikely that any other company besides Palantir is considered for contracts issued by the US government. They're already so established and solid in their industry. 

**So why does this matter?**

PLTR is going to help multiple countries with their software and digital infrastructure to help them track and trace Covid-19 and its variants. They will also be helping countries efficiently issue and distribute the vaccine. PLTR is so established in their sector that no other company will be considered for these valuable contracts. 

Their CEO Alex Karp is also a badass killer CEO who knows what he is doing. This quote from him encapsulates the potential growth PLTR can undergo. 

*""We are the only people solving problems companies won't realize they have until 2030.""* \- Alex Karp

Not only this, but the Canadian government also bought 24 mil PLTR shares after their ER. They obviously know that this stock is gonna blow up.

As Palantir grows more and more and expands to more countries (thanks to covid), they will become bigger and bigger and their stock will grow *exponentially*. 

**Buy and hold PLTR shares boys. PLTR is going to the moon  🚀🚀🚀🚀

"1.9 T Stimulus Unveiled! $1,400 each to pile into GME, PLTR, and GM. Will need to wait until February for potential infrastructure plan.",0.98,"Biden 1.9T Plan Unveiled - We will have to wait until February for any supposed Infrastructure Plan. This is strictly covid relief. Link to plan below.


Here’s what Biden calls for:

Direct payments of $1,400 to most Americans, bringing the total relief to $2,000 including December’s $600 payments

Increasing the federal, per-week unemployment benefit to $400 and extend it through the end of September

Increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour

Extending the eviction and foreclosure moratoriums until the end of September

$350 billion in state and local government aid

$170 billion for K-12 schools and institutions of higher education

$50 billion toward Covid-19 testing

$20 billion toward a national vaccine program in partnership with states, localities and tribes

Make the Child Tax Credit fully refundable for the year and increase the credit to $3,000 per child ($3,600 for a child under age 6)

The plan is the first of two major spending initiatives Biden will seek in the first few months of his presidency, according to senior Biden officials.

#The second bill, expected in February, will tackle the president-elect’s longer-term goals of creating jobs, reforming infrastructure, combatting climate change and advancing racial equity.

"Reeeeeeeeecap of today and recent market driving news (Jan 14, 2021)",0.98,"* 76% of WSB who's still in GME collectively orgasmed yesterday as GME pushed to the stratosphere with the stock soaring as high as 90% during intraday high. Profit taking and volatile swings brought the shares down to a modest close of ""only"" up 57% at $31.40. u/DeepFuckingValue, who has titanium alloy diamond hands (now known as DFV hands) posted an update and to the surprise of no one, is still holding his 1,000 contracts of Jan 15 $20c on Wednesday afternoon. (Note: He took gains on the contracts today though I'm not sure at what point in the day while keeping his April $12c).

* The pump action resumed for GME this Thursday morning with premarket pushing the underlying back to $38 once again and commenced to another wild session of large movements. Initially trading around $34 to $36 in morning, GME started to rip once again when noon struck and ran as high as $43 for the day. GME closed the day up 27% to $40. If you're STILL not in GME, these back-to-back days have pushed IV to new highs and even OTM contracts months out will be commanding large premium (~160%+ IV for April and 140%+ for July). Proceed with caution (who am I kidding just go all in).

* Morning economic numbers: jobless claims continues its dismal trend, with first-time claims hitting 965k last week vs the consensus of 800k (oof). Last week's total was 784k. As with before, market did not react to the numbers cuz its PrIcEd iN. Import prices rose 0.9 in Dec vs 0.6 expected.

* Jpow spoke at 12:30 PM today in a Princeton Uni session and reaffirmed what everyone has largely expected: rates will continue to be low and while the Feds will raise rate eventually, Jpow says that its ""no time soon"" given economic situation.

* Are they big tech or big cuck? The market reversed course and big tech continues their sell off, with MSFT, AAPL, NFLX, and AMZN all retreating more than -1% as yet another sector rotation commenced. Payment providers got an extra dose of sell-off with V closing at -3.43% and MA closing at -5.25%, despite both having positive PT from Deutsche Bank today with V having a PT increase of $270 from $220 and MA PT increase of $420 from $383.

* Small caps performed strongly today as money flow throughout the day into ""value"" grabs. RUT/IWM closed the day up 2%. Notable underlyings beyond GME are BBBY (up 18.77%), MIK (up 9.6%), M (up 5%), WSM (up 4%), and KIRK (up 9.58%).

* In WSB meme stock land MT continues in its channel, gaining 2.95% today to close at $24.81 PLTR got hit with another downgrade, this time via Citi as the analysts believes the stock is vulnerable to a few upcoming catalyst, including lockup expiry and an deceleration in growth. PT for Citi is $15 (don't worry tho surely WSB is ""in control"" with this stock too). PLUG drilled more than -5.74% during intraday low as JPM initiated with a neutral rating and downgraded sector competitor FCEL. PLUG closed the day down -4.26% to $64.63 while FCEL closed the day down -8% to $17.60, fending off intraday low of more than -12%. ICLN, the clean tech ETF continues its range bound trading and will likely require a clear catalyst in terms of what the $2 tril stimulus actually entails to move further. Buckle up, loser.

* Despite being green most of the day, major indexes retreated to red as power hour neared. Indexes went red and lost all its morning gains as the sell-off accelerated into closing hours. DOW closed the day down -0.22% or -69 pts, IXIC closed down -0.12% or -16 pts, SPX closed -0.38% or -14 pts, and RUT closed up 2% or 43 pts. While the retreat was modest compare to yesterday's close, the intraday reversal was quite jarring esp if you're trading FDs (and let's face it, you definitely were loading up on those Jan 1/15 calls).

* Earning season will soon be upon us and the first wave are starting later this week. Tomorrow morning financials kick things off as WFC, JPM, and C are all reporting before market opens. If banks shat the bed, expect a pounding for the Dow given how large of a component they are still to the stupid index. Expectations are fairly high as JPM has had a flurry of upgrades in the past few days with PT of $150 from Piper Sandler, $152 from Jefferies, and an upgrade to buy from neutral at BofA.

* Biden will unveil his $2 tril stimulus package/plan in a speech later tonight at 7:15 PM ET. Please pump those green tech cuz I have an embarrassing amount in SPAC/EVs.

Finally looked into PLTR Gotham and realized it's a glorified Data Aggregator,0.26,"Just read the [gotham overview page](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-gotham/) on the palantir site. When I first invested in Palantir it was under this public opinion that they're creating groundbreaking, innovative tech in the AI field. Pretty far from the truth.

Unfortunately, there's nothing ground breaking or new about PLTR Gotham tech. It's a data aggregator. There's a few other companies I'm aware of off the top of my head that do the same thing and have been around for over a decade. IBM datastage, Alteryx, and Tableu are the big ones that most people have heard of. It's just a platform that allows non technical people to do technical things with their data through the use of GUIs and form input.

Sorry to burst every ones bubble but the only thing that PLTR has going for it is government contracts. They are not first to market in the private sector at all. They've been beat by the greater part of a decade. Please let me know if there's features of the Gotham platform that I'm unaware of. Looking through their promotional pages I don't see anything outside of that.

The company still has great potential but the expectation that this will moon because they're entering the private sector is high hoping.

At the end of the day I know you wouldn't be able to keep your grubby little hands off this stack once $PLTR hits $100 and you need more capital to FOMO in, so at least ride the short term and buy the dirt cheap calls

For those who doubted $GME.,0.96,"You’ll be seeing a lot of gain porn throughout the entirety of today. For those of you who paper handed, I’m sorry. Although maybe it opened your eyes to realize that WSB runs the market. We’re bigger than investment firms, hence why there’s still a play to be made.

PLTR. Yet to explode, yet held on by all the same diamond hands of $GME. There’s a presentation at the end of this month for Palantir and it’s for showcasing their technology so shareholders and people who haven’t gotten in yet can better understand the product they’re providing. Although you don’t want to get in after the presentation, you need to get in before. If you think that $GME is exploding, just wait because $PLTR is known by everyone. I’ve even heard random idiots at bars talking about it. The amount of diamond 💎 hands 🖐 in PLTR is catastrophic, there’s no doubt that this company will succeed in the future. 

Lockup.

Lockup period is coming to an end, and shareholders will be selling their stakes. It’s inevitable, but that’s why you make a play on PLTR now because the drive up before lockup will be something extraordinary since shareholders will try to maximize their gains upon lockup ending. Take those GME tendies and put them straight back into the market with good ol’ Palantir.

Make some money now, sell before lockup and screw over the shareholders by forcing them to hold their shares once again. The amount of volume upon lockup ending will be tremendous and quite possibly the biggest shit show of 2021. I’m in for the ride and hope you guys are too.

TL;DR: Presentation end of month = Drive up in stock price. Lockup in early February = Drive up for shareholders to capitalize their gains.

GS earnings rocket Tues Jan 19,0.82,"Alright autists, this is the equivalent of the fastball down the middle. Goldman sachs (GS) reports Tuesday premarket and it's going to moon like your mom's boyfriend on Christmas. 

Frankly, DD is nearly pointless when you're dealing with the smartest guys in the room or even Ibank world, but if you need confirmation bias, they had a jawdropping 66.7% earning surprise $9.68 vs $5.81 whisper number last quarter. Their business model is simple, they take the opposite side of all the dumb fuck trades everyone is doing on junk with prop trading, and they go make sure they double dicked you earlier by buying at half the price before everyone else could even look at (ABNB, ya autists).  That's just the IPOs you hear about because you can be sure they're dicking everybody in every sector of your mom.

Shit don't take it from me, even WSJ is pumping this shit [https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-sachs-nears-a-share-price-record-11609944958:](https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-sachs-nears-a-share-price-record-11609944958:) ""Jeffries Financial Group Inc. said late Monday that its investing banking revenue hit a record"" and ""Banks will be able to return capital in the first quarter, but it can’t exceed their average quarterly profit over the past year. That may benefit Goldman, in particular, because of its strong profitability.""  Why the hell is WSJ pumping GS? Because they've got insiders everywhere, even Biden is bending the knee [https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-is-expected-to-name-gary-gensler-for-sec-chairman-11610487023](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-is-expected-to-name-gary-gensler-for-sec-chairman-11610487023).  This is one we can all get behind cuz GS has got the volume and cap to hold your mom on a Black Friday siesta.

Maxing out my personal and company Credit Cards and going YOLO on one last Hail Mary,0.94,"Hello retards!

Meet your new King👑

Before going further, im 100% doing this no matter which one of u MIT janitors try to convince me not to.

Heres my story:

Small business owner who sunk 220k into his business over the past few years. Got shut down for 3.5 months (phase 2 nyc) opened back up in mid june. Took a SBA loan to pay back rent, got robbed 2 months later for 90k of inventory. Insurance fucked me. Now im slowly dying in the abyss of slowly increasing debt with no end in sight.

Game plan: looking for an exchange that allows me to use credit cards to buy shares. Have about $110k in credit card limits for the company alone.

Now im looking into stockpile as it seems to be the only place i can be a full autist BUT there are major drawback. Worst one is that if you buy a stock it wont go through till EOD which is insane. Looking for a better exchange. 

And of youre wondering, im YOLO'ing the following stocks

STPK
LAZR
TSLA
AND THE MOTHER FUCKING UNDESPUTED HEAVY WEIGHT CHAMPION 
PLTR

And now before you ask, why the fucking hell is he doing this? Let me tell you! I can fold the company or go bankrupt, but im still liable to pay back wholesalers who've given me credit, the SBA loan which i literally spent on rent i had to pay from being forced to close, the loan i took to repair the store after the robbery, and company credit which i been using to pay some bills. Id literally have to pay 50k+ AFTER my company goes bankrupt. FUCK THAT SHIT. 

I literally tried the betamale path, working hard wage slave about, dont ever open a business. Just dont fucking do it. All the money i made i out back in the store and was taken from me in the robbery (90k worth of product plus 4500$ for new gate and locks). Im going to lose everything anyways might as well yolo tf out of it 

YOLO PUSSIES

P.s. any advice on which exchange to use would be absolutely appreciated because i cant trade options on stock pile",2021-01-13 14:28:23

$PLTR also has pricd targets at 30 by others that sre already in. So dont go panicking unless you're an autist that bought fds. PLTR is getting contracts left and right if you're watching, its only a matter of time until they get larger ones.

lockup is expiring somewhere in mid February. That means insiders, a lot of whom will want to sell their shares by then, will want the share price to be high so they can obviously cash out more money! Up until then, these insiders will be trying to push the price up.

This is what Palantir does [A data analyst's take],0.96,"I'll let you guys in on a secret since none of you retards seem to get it.

**Amazon Redshift sucks**. AWS is great no doubt. Redshift also deserves credit for being pioneers, but the data community has found in the last 10 years that it suffers from architectural issues that make it difficult for organizations to function without a central data engineering team, which becomes less feasible the larger you get.

In the early 2010s, forward looking companies started to realize the issue with Redshift style data warehousing, and attempted to solve this problem by creating a ""data lake"" of flat files to serve as the organizations ""source of truth"" instead of relying solely on data warehouses. Many companies failed to set this up after trying, and reverted to their old ways of settling for fragmented clusters on Redshift.

**Now let me introduce you to Snowflake**. Snowflake solves this issue by doing the ""data lake"" part for you. You can pretend like you're using Redshift and they'll figure out the rest. Plus they let you scale your cluster size based on what you need without commitment? Plus QOL improvements for SQL? Whoa! No wonder they are valued at $100 billion.

**Here comes Palantir though**, and they are like ""No no no no no you guys are much more retarded than that. Not even Snowflake will save you retards. You need us to do it for you. Because we are super smart. And you are not.""

And let me tell me you, they are sort of right, in some cases. Which cases? Well, so far governments around the world. Also Japanese companies, who are notorious for being late to the data party.

My first impression as a data analyst when I saw Palantir Foundry and Gotham was ""pshhhhhhh I can do that"". But the more I thought about it, that's exactly why I get paid the way I do.

I am long PLTR because I think most financial analysts are underestimating the appeal of simplification and quality that Palantir brings to the table. They are attempting to replace me. They think they can do it harder, better, faster, and stronger. So far the downside is cost, but they are obviously trying to market themselves as a premium company, and succeeding at it so far.

**TL;DR:**  Today they are Airflow-plus x Tableau-lite w/ Apple marketing, but tomorrow they will replace data analysts like myself.",2021-01-13 00:49:12

&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;Customers include the U.S. federal government, foreign governments, commercial enterprises and state and local government agencies. Kratos is organized into six major divisions:

**Why You’re Really Here**

**October 8th, 2020**, ARK Investment Management LLC filed a 13F-HR form disclosing ownership of **558,726 shares** worth $8,733,000.

**November 30th, 2020**, ARK Investment Management LLC filed a 13F-HR form disclosing ownership of **1,106,685 shares** worth about $21,337,000 USD—representing a 98% increase in shares and a 144% increase in value in under two months. GUH 🚀🚀🚀

ARK recently doubled their stake in KTOS, and they're are not alone in their confidence. 

Smart money loves KTOS, as illustrated by their 89.86% institutional ownership: 

* Blackrock has a 6.83% stake in the company at 8.3 million shares
* Vanguard has a 6.55% stake at 8 million shares
* Fidelity has a 5.36% stake at 6.6 millions shares. [Source](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=KTOS&amp;amp;subView=institutional)

I'm no genius, and neither are you. But I have made myself good money riding the coattails of those with billions at stake and teams of researchers behind them.

That said, institutional ownership comes as no surprise as far as defense companies go. Instituions love to own them. They’re safe investments. The military's got deep pockets and smart money knows never to bet against America. 

However, Kratos is not just any old Defense and Aerospace company. There is a reason that ARKQ [added 153,098 shares to their fund just last week.](https://cathiesark.com/ark-combined-holdings-of-ktos)

**Like GRWG, Kratos Defense and Security Solutions has spent the last ten years gobbling up their competition.** Six acquisitions and one merger later, the frequency of their contracts reflect their place as a leader in military tech development:

Kratos’ acquisitions have allowed it to develop proprietary technologies that are sold as products. Not only that, but as many of the above contracts show, they are also being paid 🚀 buku bucks 🚀 to maintain and service the products and tech that they sell.

But ok yeah, sure, they produce: disposable missiles made for aerial target practice, small sUAS swarming drones, satellites, radios, and augmented reality simulation training systems and microwave electronics—but that is not what grabbed my attention and surely not what grabbed the attention of Cathie Ark. 

Ready for the kicker? Say it with me now:

**Ground Vehicle Automation**

&amp;gt;The Kratos Multi-Platform Appliqué Kit (M-PAK) is the next generation of Ground Vehicle automation. The system can be used to quickly and easily convert your existing fleet of standard human-driven vehicles into optionally-manned systems that can be driven in manned or unmanned modes. M-PAK is a scalable system that can be used as a stand-alone vehicle mobility kit or sensors can be added to offer various levels of autonomy… M-PAK allows for a semi-permanent installation in a vehicle, which releases the user from committing to one vehicle platform or a particular vehicle.

These two developments are why Cathie bought up KTOS for ARKQ. These vehicle conversion kits also represent Kratos’ foray into the commercial space. Their ground vehicle automation kits, originally used to safely lead military convoys, are now used to man impact-absorbing trailers behind slow-moving highway construction vehicles. Up until recently, the job of driving the impact truck was filled by some poor employee. Now, with Kratos’ product, this job can be completely automated, with the GPS-guided computer safely trailing whatever work vehicle it is instructed to. [Source](https://www.kratosdefense.com/systems-and-platforms/unmanned-systems/ground/autonomous-truck-mounted-attenuator)

Basically, you can turn any truck into a completely independently acting, simple, autonomous vehicle with the installation of this semipermanent kit.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Sea Surface Vehicle Automation** 

&amp;gt;Kratos \[has also\]developed a number of vehicle control systems that are easily installed and quickly convert most human-driven seaborne vessels to unmanned systems.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;The Kratos C2 is currently in use and supporting mission operations for the U.S. Navy and Army utilizing the High-Speed Maneuvering Surface Target (HSMST), which was developed in response to a requirement for a 40+ knot target to represent littoral threats encountered by the fleet and which would retain 35 kt capability in advanced sea states. [Source](https://www.kratosdefense.com/products/uav/land-and-sea/sea-surface-vehicle-automation)

So they’re making boat drones too. 

Militarily, these unmanned sea surface vehicles can be used against seaborne targets and mine hunting. Commercially, the tech being developed by Kratos may have applications in cargo shipping, seaweed farming, and data collection.

**Most Importantly**

In terms of the fundamentals, **tomorrow, January 13, there will be a virtual conference during which time they will be exhibiting some more of their new tech.** I believe that they will play into the recent EV/AI hype and focus on these automation kits and their potential foray into the commercial space. With some good media coverage, I think this could be a very positive catalyst for the stock. I tried calling investor relations to ask some questions, but they dubbed my calls. **Big dick energy. Bullish.** 🚀🚀🚀

&amp;gt;President &amp;amp; CEO, Eric DeMarco, and its Executive VP &amp;amp; CFO, Deanna Lund, will present at the 23rd Annual Needham Virtual Conference on January 13th at 11:30am Eastern.

**NOW ON TO MY FAVORITE PART: THE TECHNICALS!!!!!**

Very simple, very bullish. Consolidation on an upwards trend.

Breakout above the channel and a retest of resistance becoming support. Super solid buy wall at around $25.69. Anything around these levels I would count as buying the bottom. Set a stop loss slightly below the support to minimize downside risk. 

This morning January 12th, premarket action suggests a moon mission. They were [just awarded another 12 million dollar contract a few hours ago](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kratos-awarded-127-million-task-order-complete-cost-optimized). 

**TL;DR: : With its powerful acquisitions, sticky government contacts, consistent revenue growth, institutional backing, THICC technicals and TOMORROW'S imminent positive catalyst, KTOS cannot go tits up. Not to mention Blackrock, Vanguard, and most importantly—Mommy ARK are on our side.**

August 2021.,0.86,"Its Monday, 2nd August 2021. PLTR has hit 19 after trading in the low teens for months, while TSLA is now 3000 and steel companies have hit new ATHs. You've lost half your account on TSLA puts and PLTR calls. You don't have any steel stocks because the other half is in GME shares, bought at 20.50 since Ryan Cohen and his best buds joined the board of directors.

But apart from news of GME pulling out of ICR, there hasn't been any news from GME since January and its now trading at 12 bucks a share. You hear a noise behind and and turn around to see your wife and her boyfriend pointing and laughing at you before they go into her bedroom and close the door.

Dejected, you sell your GME shares and head over to [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) to find some boomer stock that pays you 5 bucks a year in dividends.

While browsing, you get a notification about a new tweet from Ryan, the man himself. Its a singular rocket emoji with a link to GameStop's website. Curious, you click the link.

""Gamestop is now pleased to announce that it is now the sole and official distributor of Corsair products, NVIDIA cards, and AMD CPUs. We have also partnered with Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo to be the only distributor of their games and consoles. We have developed technology to stop bots from scalping new hardware. With these new partnerships, GameStop will be the world's first and only company dedicated solely to gamers. Also we are the only official North American dealer for Nio.""

Weekly Update: Selling the most popular options contracts on Reddit 1/15 EXP,0.85,"I am back this week with some really interesting data to share.  As expected the amount of stocks / contracts picked up massively from last week. For the expiration of 1/15/21 there were 838 contracts  and 1826 mentions of these contracts.  Compared to last week this is a huge jump and really something to talk about.

For those that are new here is a quick introduction: I have been analyzing comments and posts on reddit to determine what stocks/contracts are mentioned the most. This week I am looking at the options contracts that have been mentioned on the subreddits we track. Specifically, I am looking at contracts expiring this Friday 1/15/2021. The data collected for this analysis was collected from 1/1 – 1/8.

The goal here is to track what reddit is following and to see how reddit preforms. There is this notion that retail investors often fail to beat the market. This is why financial advisors recommend that you buy into the major ETF’s such as SPY. As historically there have been few people that manage to beat the major Index’s year over year. My hypothesis going into this week is that I should bet against the trends on reddit as typically the retail investor is wrong.

Current Results: 

1. Week 1: +$1710
2. Week 2: -$2610
3. Week 3: +$45

Total: -$855 

Though we are in the negative out of the 8 contracts our data suggested we sell 7 of them were profitable.  I think the loss so far is mostly attributed to position sizing, but thats something I will work on in the future. 

I just want to emphasize it does not matter if I am right or wrong. More importantly this research is to identify if there are any trends worth following. Please do not argue below that I am wrong or right this is research and I am sharing the results. 

# Call Data

* Out of 838 Contracts 648 are calls (77% Calls)
* 56% of the calls are out of the money
* The out of the money calls are on average 25% out of the money
* The in the money calls are on average 20% in the money (probably because of the huge pump last couple of weeks)

# Put Data 

* Out of 838 Contracts 175 are Puts (23%)
* 86% of the calls are out of the money
* The in the money puts are 25% in the money
* The out of the money puts are 29% out of the money 

Just based on the above data is is clear that reddit is leaning heavily bullish into the 1/15 expiration.

Deere and Co,0.82,"First DD so don’t piss on me please.

An agriculture manufacturer for those who don’t know, completely underrated stock, been buying and selling this since 130$.

Deere will be on display at CES 2021 and won an award for their X-Series combine. In the the most compulsory sector of the world: farming. Deere tractors are synonymous with quality in the US. Last September Ford’s Farley said he wants Ford to “Run like a Deere”. Farmers rely on their equipment for their livelihood, and the rest of us rely on them to farm shit and send it to us.

If you look at the chart for DE you’ll notice it’s always green. John Deere tractors are green. Coincidence? Doubt it.

Reuters Stock Reports Plus gives DE a 9/10 which on par with Apple and other good shit. One of ARK’s portfolios has been buying it recently (ARKQ?) and I’ve personally just doubled down and bought more. P/E is a relatively modest 33.8 and cash flow per share at 15.54, and a Reuters risk score of 10. Literally can’t go tits up. 

Earnings was beaten every quarter last year and Morgan Stanley have them at Overweight with a price target of 341 doll hairs. It’s actually a profitable company producing slabs of cash so it’s not in the radar for these 800 year old analysts to attack instead of retiring. SPEAKING OF it’s could be seen as a bit of a boomer stock since it’s been around forever and gives a little dividend (3.04$ PA) which doesn’t hurt either. The IV is lower than Trump’s IQ so it’s pretty unlikely that’s it’s going to be subject to major swings, the thing barely even moves premarket.

With the move to autonomous vehicles we can expect that at some point the agriculture industry is going to follow suit, with numerous extensions available for their equipment, the Deere’s are pretty close to driving themselves and last year a fully autonomous tractor concept was unveiled. This will save farmers zillions of hours of work.

I know you guys don’t necessarily like Technical Analysis but $PLTR.,0.91,"So here’s my DD: 

$PLTR is building a steady and solid Relative Strength Index rating. 

It got an analyst upgrade this AM to $30. 

Looking at a 3 month chart, you see the (obvious) flight from $11 - $30 through the beginning to the end of November. From here, PLTR forms a bullish pennant, signaling strong support levels and lower highs compared to the higher lows. This forms the narrowing pattern and pause in the price movement that leads into the eventual breakout. 🚀

This is all from a technical standpoint, which is how I trade personally, and I know you guys think it’s bullshit. But if there are enough retards out there thinking like me, they’ll be buying in too. 

$PLTR may finally fly again 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Quick DD for who ever wants to listen and make you quick tendies,0.77,"TLDR: SRPT 🚀

Ok, retards. So SRPT dropped 51% last week because they did not reach a main goal in one of their clinical trials. BUT this shit is normal for genomics and does not warrant a 51% drop. People got scared and sold and it’s looking to gain a minimum of 20% this week for a few reasons.
1. The JP Morgan Healthcare conference is happening this week and they will be there. The major point of this conference is to get institutions to buy invest. During this conference they will show how it’s normal to not meet main goals and will show their pipeline success which means they will land new investors plus old will buy on discounted price. 
2. All genomics go through this. There will be goals not met through the process. What is mainly important is how successful their overall pipeline is and their future work. You can check it out on their website. All indicators are great.
3. I invest heavily in this field and actually do research which is why I don’t throw my money at GME and PLTR to lose it.
4. A company just doesn’t lose half its value because of one goal not met in one of many on going clinical trials. 
5. 🚀

Just buy the stock and thank me later.

Edit: forgot to add there’s another class action lawsuit filed on Jan 7th. This happened at the end of 2013, which they bounced back from really quick.

I built a program that detects buzzing stocks on Reddit and Twitter,0.97,"As a poor investor but good developer (or so I like to think), I built a program on python that spots emerging stocks on Reddit and Twitter so y’all can make sweet tendies 🚀

So far, the majority of the picks are small caps so I can’t publish them here based on the sub's rules. However, I still want to share with you all the higher caps that were surfaced.

**For y’all degenerates, just skip those next paragraphs and go straight to the picks. For y’all nerds who want to understand a thing or two about my program, keep on reading.**

* My program, built on Python, scans Reddit and Twitter and bubbles up stocks that just started generating conversations. So we’re not talking about the over discussed stocks like TSLA, PLTR, PLUG and such. We’re talking about the next ones.
* I’ve been beta testing and tweaking the tool for the past year and although, there is room for improvement, it has allowed me to spot and pick up stocks such as PLUG, PENN or NET really early (bought in respectively at $3, $10 and $20) solely based on the tool’s insights.

**Ok, now that this is clear for everyone, here’s how to interpret the stock picks.**

* The percentage increase (+%) is based on a WoW (week on week) analysis. That means I am comparing mentions of a stock/ticker from one week to the previous week. I also use MoM and YoY data to inform the picks (a stock might surface this week based on big news but it might have been mentioned over and over during the year, which means it wouldn’t be considered an “emerging stock” based on my model).
* The “Reasoning” I provide is based on a light research I do on my own before highlighting any of the program’s picks in order to understand why they’re generating conversation. If I find out that they are based on a PnD, I filter the stocks out. If I have any doubt, I filter them out too but will mention them at the bottom of the results so people can form their own opinions.

**Warning**: I am a programmer, not a financial analyst. My goal is to share with you the results my program provides, not recommend any buys.

**Enough said, here’s the (small) list!**

**Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT) +670%**

Market Cap: $6.5bn

Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, focuses on the discovery and development of RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy, and other genetic therapeutic modalities approaches for the treatment of rare diseases.

Reasoning: The stock tanked 51% on Friday due to mixed test results on a gene therapy targeting muscular dystrophy. Note that they have 43 different therapies in their pipeline and 1 received mixed results so far. ARKG owns SRPT and reacted to the news by buying +700k shares.

**Magna International (MGA) +436%**

Market Cap: $22.7bn

Magna International Inc. designs, engineers, and manufactures components, assemblies, systems, subsystems, and modules for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of vehicles and light trucks worldwide. Clients include Aston Martin, BMW, Ford, Daimler, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubish, Peugeot, Citroen, Renault, Nissan, Toyota, Volkswagen, Volvo.

Reasoning: LG and Magna partnered to electrify powertrains last week. Rumors have now spread that Magna could potentially become the manufacturer of Apple’s new car.

Disclaimer: I do not currently own any shares in SRPT. I own shares in MGA.

If y'all find these insights useful, please let me know and I’ll keep sharing them here on a weekly basis :)",2021-01-10 22:00:33
OAC – A Sleeping Giant. Kylie Jenner promoted their product her Instagram,0.75,"  

Okay, I admit, I originally dismissed this stock because of the terrible DD’s previously posted about this. OAC is a blank cheque company that will be merging with HIMS & HERS.

A lot of the other DD’s have mistakenly categorized HIMS as a company that specializes in selling erectile disfunction pills, which ironically, I found as a turn off and dismissed it completely. However, I decided to give this company a second look because of the recent price action on the stock and what I found was a sleeping giant in the making. Yes, it’s true that they do sell ‘boner pills’, but that’s just one product among many others (i.e. hair loss treatment, birth control, acne, etc.). What caught my attention wasn’t what they were selling, but HOW they were selling it. Take Amazon for example, which was a company that sold books originally, and expanded into other products as it grew. What made Amazon successful wasn’t what they were selling, but HOW they were selling it. 

HIMS is looking to position themselves as a Telehealth disruptor in the Healthcare space. How they are unique from any other e-commerce platform that simply sells medication is the fact that they have a unique network of physicians that will address consumer concerns. For example, a person that has concerns about their hair loss might be too self-conscious to go into a doctor’s office to get a prescription and then must take that prescription to get fulfilled at a pharmacy. The whole process is embarrassing and intimidating, and as a result, the customer might just not seek a solution all together. However, with HIMS, the customer can consult a doctor remotely, get a prescription, order his medication, and have it delivered to him all through his phone and in the comfort of his own home. This in a nutshell is what give HIMS their unique competitive advantage. 

What really attracted me to HIMS were their financials. The company has been in operation for 3 years and the company is almost generating net positive EBITDA and will be in the next year or two (think about what happened to $SNAP when they were finally able to turn a profit and the stock price blew up). In their latest S4 Amendment, it shows their Q3 results in 2020 vs. their Q3 results in 2019. They were able to generate almost twice as much Revenue (from $57 Million into $107 Million) and was able to reduce their marketing expense (from $49 million into $39 million) at the same time. Not only that, but they were also able to increase their gross margins from 51% into 72%. As a result of their increased revenue, gross margins and decrease marketing expense, they were able to improve their EBITDA by $49 Million Year over year in 2020. They will mostly likely be EBITDA positive in 2021 when they finish their merger with OAC. Keep in mind that the company is only 3 years old and still have lots and lots of run room. Their growth potential is exponential. 

So far, I have demonstrated that the company has an amazing business model and amazing financials, but what about their social media presence? The HIMS account has 99.9K followers and the HERS account has 100K followers, for a total combined following of 199.9K followers. Their closet competitor is Lemonaid Health, and they only have a total combined following of 8.3K. So clearly HIMS has a lot more social influence than their competitor and once again keep in mind the company is only 3 years old. Having a strong social media influence is part of the reason why they were able to generate more revenue while spending less in marketing in the year of 2020. Most recently, Kylie Jenner (The world’s youngest self-made billionaire with 208m followers on Instagram) posted an Instagram story of her buying HERS product and tagging Jennifer Lopez (who is a primary business partner and investor of HIMS & HERS). Having strong social media influencers like Kylie Jenner and Jennifer Lopez allows HIMS & HERS to bypass and save money on traditional marketing (like billboards and magazines) and allows the company to directly advertise to their primary target market (a generation of users that prioritize their mental and physical health, and prefer to conduct their business online)

So, they have a great business model, financials, and social media presence, but what about their management team and investors? Andrew Dudum, is the CEO of HIMS & HERS, but before that he was the co-found of ATOMIC, a company that specializes in start-up. The guy literately started a start-up company that focuses on start-ups. This means he knows a thing or two about company valuations and reaching out to venture capitalist to generate funding and increase valuations. As a result, he was able to receive funding from notable investors such as Peter Theil (the guy that invested in FB, PLTR, and many other blow out companies in the early stages).

Okay, so the company has a great business model, financials, social media and leadership, but how much can I expect on my return on investment? The OAC merger gives HIMS a valuation of $1.6 Billion at $10 per share. Currently OAC is trading at around $15, which gives HIMS an implied valuation that is greater than $2 Billion now. However, the CEO, Andrew Dudum, is suggesting the company has a potential to reach $20 Billion, which is a 10X bagger from $15 to $150 per share in the future after the merger. The merger with OAC is expected to be completed by the end of January, afterwards the ticker symbol will start trading as HIMS.

Position: 1K shares

TLDR: OAC Merging with HIMS - The company has a great business model, financials, social media presence, leadership team, and future valuation. Merger expected to be completed by end of month.

FUCKED ON BBBY EARNINGS? WE WILL FLY AGAIN 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,0.82,"You have all corrupted my mind. My perception of the outside world is now filtered through the lens of stonks. So naturally when this appeared in my advertisement inbox, I knew this had to be shared with my fellow self-proclaimed autists/retards:

https://preview.redd.it/iqtb7uzhlea61.jpg?width=1036&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ccb6da014901b16a8cbaf11ddb1535e280e39019

My first thought after seeing this was ""fuck, I could outpace $29/year"". You'd only have to spend $145 a year? Easily done at BBBY.

Quarantine still going on and can't make it to Ashleigh's wedding? Beyond+ sub.

Virtual gender reveal for Carleigh's future POS kid? Beyond+ sub.

Kayleigh is about to go off to college for her first year of getting reamed by WSB autists? Beyond+ sub.

All no problem for BBBY Beyond+, now cheaper than using AMZN prime. And once quarantine is over people are about to go even harder for these exact life events. 100x more weddings, thousands of rona babies, and all the freshman about to fail out of college. Only a matter of time until we are back in the full swing of things and this subscription is fully utilized by the masses to ""save people money"" aka encourages them to spend more.

Edit: Take a fraction of how many people subscribe to amazon prime (as of December 2019, there were an estimated **112 million** U.S. Amazon Prime subscribers). Maybe a million Karen's? Cool. That's an easy $29MM, now say half do the math and spend the $145 to recoup the subscription cost. That's an easy $72.5 MM. I know you have to subtract shipping but still. Shit ton of revenue and new e-commerce traffic.

Why market moves(long),0.93,"To understand how stocks move, first, you gotta understand the interaction between buyers and sellers. Basically, it's Econ-101 supply and demand. Too much demand? Buyers will have to raise their prices so that sellers sell.

Second, the types of market participants. Active and passive participants.

Passive participants are like, buy buy sell buy sell buy sell buy buy buy sell buy sell sell buy. This is almost completely automated and determined by the weighting of the stock versus the index or the methodology that it is following.

The bots of VOO, for example, don't give a damn if an accounting scandal has happened or if a new breakthrough has been reached. Every day, it will buy and sell stocks indiscriminately, following the algos.

And increasingly, newer assets under management are coming mostly under those passive investment vehicles such as passive ETFs, passive mutual funds etc leading to them having a larger and larger share of the market. (I am coming to active participants later)

Thirdly, you gotta understand hedging. Which is basically an investment position to offset losses. Example, you sell a naked call. You see the stock moving closer to the strike price. You immediately buy shares to ensure that you don't take a loss.

# Ok, now why do individual stocks move?

They move based on events (plain old news, market-related movements etc). Now, let's go back to active participants such as retail investors, hedge funds, fund managers etc.

Suppose, there's a quarterly earnings report coming out for ASML. Almost all active participants have somehow figured from various news reports that the earnings report will be good because of the huge demand for ASML's product.

As a result, an active fund manager takes a big position on that stock. The stock moves a bit. Hedge funds and other firms also take their positions.

A retard post about the company's upcoming good earnings on the internet and all early retard investors quickly get in.

The stock moves up. In the meantime, the passive funds are adjusting their position in the stock, realtime. If it's going up. They are buying more to adjust their position.

Now, don't forget. Those passive ETFs or funds have other semiconductor stocks in their ETFs and shits. Which means, even if only ASMLs quarterly earnings were supposed to be good, other stocks of the same sector will benefit. As there are tons of both active and passive algos that don't trade individual stocks but ETFs and similar stuff due to liquidity reasons or other reasons.

Edit: for clarification, this is not the only type of passive investment ETFs. In fact, some will sell if the stock rises.

This gets even better. Suppose, lots of retail investors are also buying call options of this stock. If the underlying continues to go up, the delta could keep on rising. Suppose it went from 5% to 10% to 20%. This would force the option sellers to keep on buying more and more shares and could lead to gamma explosion where the market makers create a violent feedback loop due to hedging.

It gets more fun than that. Remember the various HFT firms and scalper bots? Well, they know it all too well that some firms are busy at hedging frenzy. They also join in on the feeding frenzy that is this stock.

After said earnings release(or most likely, just before it), most of the active participants like retail traders and hedge funds may well start taking profits. And the stock generally runs up more than the expected in the first place.

This leads to the violent unwinding of the positions that we generally see after the earnings release. Because everything happens in the exact reverse order I just described here. That's why it's a terrible gamble to buy options in hope of a good earnings release or similar news.

It feels euphoric if you are on the right side of the tide and equally depressing if you are on the wrong side of the tide.

The same thing can happen in the opposite direction if a piece of bad news is expected or happens.

Here, earnings release is just one of the events that I described. It could be any event like index inclusion, regulatory shifts, stock splits, analyst upgrade-downgrades, some fund manager or hedge funds buying the stock etc.

Also, don't forget that all this is also affecting other stocks in the same sector/region etc due to them being connected through passive investments and active participants exploiting the passive participants.

A very recent example of this happening would be the stock PLTR. Remember, they signed a contract with FDA for $44M but the stock moved almost $10B or more(I haven't calculated) or about 20%. Two weeks ago maybe, Citron declared short attack and a violent unwinding of positions happened and the stock went down about 15-20% after climbing 10-12% that day. Or the day before that when it climbed 20%+.

Now I have sold calls on PLTR (yeah, I like it that your 12/04, 12/11, 12/18 expired or will expire worthless).

**This is not how all stocks move.**

But a large portion of the stocks that are mentioned here in the sub move this way. This is why it sometimes feels like to you folks as KINDA pump and dump. But whether you retards accept it or not I know you guys are the cream of the crop. While most of you act as if you know nothing, I know very well most of you probably make money.

You guys are like people who watch tech reviews to buy a smartphone.

Ok, I completely went out of topic. Sorry.

**This is not how all stocks move.**

Some boomer stocks like MMM, JBT etc may have low retail interest. In those cases, the stocks are almost absolutely up to the mercy of other active participants, who or which may as well not care that much leaving those stocks to the hands of the algos of passive participants.

But in those whole processes, there's almost no price discovery that's actually working. Passive algos are buying and selling (but mostly creating buying pressure) completely arbitrarily, HFT bots buying and selling because, reasons.

The participants who are using traditional valuation metrics, analyzing the good and bad of stocks are getting outnumbered by all the other participants and generally speaking, the volume of their trades are also declining in the overall market. Think of big participants like Berkshire(which is undoubtedly the most powerful active participant in the market), pension funds, sovereign funds etc, they barely buy or sell any stocks they have if they have entered on the right price.

Sure, I am kinda underselling the influence of big institutional investors, but it is not completely without any merit.

**So you are saying there's no price discovery in the various stocks?**

Absolutely not. Even in the greatly flawed system I described being used by most market participants there's plenty of it happening by newsflashes, sell-side analyst recommendations, retail fomoers etc.

Only the stocks that have heavy institutional ownerships, with a healthy retail interest seems to me to be less volatile(this is my intuition speaking really, so this statement is probably false in the first place) such as MSFT etc and they probably have better price discovery.

**What about those stocks doubling the day they IPO?**

The reason behind that is very simple. Tons of retail investors place Market Orders. This means they are ready to pay whatever the price this thing will go for. In those scenarios, investment banks can hardly control the price of the stock as there's just too much demand to satisfy. In short, it's a feeding frenzy. And this is one of the things that's primarily driven by retail interest.

**What about those SPACs and low-float stocks?**

Well, this again needs no explaining. Too low float, too much interest. Various whales also know this and use this for their benefit. After the merger is complete(or slightly before it) retail investors and whales leave for the next thing in the line. So the stock tanks and the stock price never recovers.

If the company that's being pumped is actually any good, the stock would likely later get the attention it deserves after the sell-off.

I hope all those points are good enough to explain most of the funky behaviour an individual stock would make. I know my explanations are not exhaustive and there are many angles I haven't covered, but it is what it is.

Now, to the MORE IMPORTANT STUFF. Individual stocks also move due to numerous macro reasons. When the entire market is in a euphoric phase, you can throw a dart and that stock would move up. The opposite and the stock would go down.

# Why and how does the market move?

Liquidity. This is probably the most important thing that drives the market as a whole.

Excess liquidity that's circling around will inevitably try to enter into the economy in one way or another. Either through purchasing more assets or any other way.

Now, we all know it pretty well that this trend is being exaggerated by the low-interest-rate environment that's present in the current developed markets. People are being forced to participate in the market in the hunt for return.

Also, almost every investor from every country seems to be more interested to participate in the US stock market, even more than their home markets. And the recent trend of commission-free brokerage services and easy flow of capital has helped to provide even more participation in the stock market than usual.

Options trading is also at historic highs and probably most of you buy call options and put options is probably mostly bought by institutional investors(like it always were). As a whole, this frenzy can move the market very quickly.

Remember, SoftBank bought billions in options on very concentrated tech names? That along with retail call options purchasing mania lead the market to a euphoric state. The S&P 500 has become so heavily influenced by those tech names that if they move, the entire market moves. If they fall, the entire market falls.

But we haven't probably addressed a big elephant in the room. Volatility suppression.

Futures traders, algos, our central bank etc all are participating in the dangerous game of volatility suppression. 

This all can unwind though. And it can unwind fairly quickly.

If we take the case of February or March. If you remember, Mr Ackman was screaming fire, fire, fire(he have had his intentions) but the market was barely paying attention.

But with the lockdowns and everything, suddenly everyone seems to have gotten caught with their pants down.

And you know how quick all the things were. Active investors, retail investors everyone suddenly flocked for put options, VIX etc. A Minsky moment has suddenly come.

Margin calls, longs are burnt left and right, market makers have completely turned their positions etc, you know the usual deal but exactly in the opposite direction.

Suddenly gold, treasuries, cryptos etc whatever are being sold to cover their positions. Institutional investors are suddenly visited by their risk managements and they suddenly become net sellers.

Passive investments vehicles also sell stocks that are being kicked heavily.

Literally, everyone's a seller. No one wants to buy. And the situation doesn't change until the Fed comes in and says, ""Brrrr"".

Liquidity suddenly becomes available in the debt market. Retail investors jump. Buy the dip, they said. Money keeps flowing in from everywhere.

There are many other things that I probably needed to say to complete the story. But it is what it is.

Also, interest rate trumps over everything. Every valuation metrics, pricing schemes are dependent on it. So that's super important.

Let's say suddenly interest rates rise the market will immediately collapse along with your meme stock. Because of two main reasons. Every company is loaded with debt and the risk free return has just increased resulting in more money chasing treasury bonds and other instruments.

# These pieces of information any useful?

Yes and no. As they say, hindsight is always 20/20.

Let me tell you my short story navigating the market this year.

February. News of the virus and everything. I see VIX, S&P, bond market, foreign markets etc and I keep sucking my thumb thinking nothing's going to happen. Being burnt by two trades and market starting to freefall almost. I realize my mistake and change my strategy.

Fed says, ""Brrr"". I fail to change my strategy. Something even worse could be coming. Lol. After almost a week passing I realise my f\*\*\*ing mistake. Again. At least I can say it's not just me.

The information is almost always there. Problem is we(not everyone of course, some of you are much more flexible) fail to act upon it. 

Ok, one more story about an individual stock.

Remember AAPL's third-quarter earnings result? I sold calls before earnings thinking the stock will go down after earnings report.

There was overwhelming evidence that this is not going to be true. And I read almost all of it (WFH and everything). Yet my monkey brain somehow decided to trust the analyst estimates and the overall news cycle surrounding the economy.

AAPL then reported a literal blow away quarterly earnings report.

For me 2020 was a year of reckoning and I learned to remove my directional assumption from the market and to just go with the flow. But I am pretty sure it wouldn't matter, cause when it's time, I just wouldn't remember.

I posted this one before but it got removed by votebots.",2021-01-09 04:01:50

Yeah I get it, we have had a rough and painful fucking week. Every orifice we have has been smokefucked relentlessly by Melvin and his circle jerk penises hiding in suits. It hurts, but the bleeding will stop. Now suck it the fuck up. It's time to pack some gauze and toilet paper. Put your helmets and retard safety gear on because Ryan Cohen has us swaddled in his arms.

For all you raisin brains working your double fast food shifts and lacking the time to watch Ryan Cohen's twitter like the fat kid eyeing the last 5 donuts in your Krispy Kreme box, I have your back.

As we all know, a great leader doesn't show face 24/7, but they do come around when you are bent over backwards getting pillaged into oblivion by Melvin's STD riddled uvula puncher in a dark alley behind a Waffle House. This time is no different. Our savior Ryan Cohen just told all you dimwit-fell-off-the-shortbus-smooth-brains to strap in for a ""fun ride."" I went ahead and took a break from half chub jerking off to my friend's TESLA gains to reverse image search this high quality piece of treasure.

Massive Membrane Ryan Cohen took some time out of his day to search roller coaster memes and found this one. We have been instructed to ""keep arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times"". This isn't just some numbing gel to soothe the pain of our torn open and prolapsed assholes. ICR conference is next week and I know some of you weak handed semen squirters hopped on the ride and chickened out at a fucking loss, right before it started. You left your dignity in the same bathroom that you threw your shit-stained underwear. We are gonna go on the ride of a lifetime with enough action that you'll finally have something relatable to tell your wife's boyfriend. It's one that will make your chump pump inflate so explosively that you'll feel a sharp tug on your butthole.

Yesterday was everyone but us (and PLTR, sorry guys). Today was Tesla swinging their nuts like vibranium reinforced wrecking balls, knocking every sell wall out like Mike Tyson KO'ing your crippled grandma over the last bit of Chicken Tikka Masala... and everybody else but us again. However, our time to shine is almost upon us. Our balls drop next week and you might even get your first erection. When this rocket starts blasting, you'll go from your first pube to filming your first consensual orgy in record time. (Thanks Melvin for making me point out the sex acts you've forced on us).

For all you cowards that sold out of GME today and made some money. I am still proud. Either hop back in with more than you had before or go make tendies elsewhere and be prosperous. For you other sperm suckers that sold out of GME today at $17.08 because you have weaker hands than a sleeping quadriplegic, I hope you like giving throat jobs at truck stops for pocket change. Lemme do you a favor, if you sold out of GME at a loss and weren't up EOD, don't hop back in or your toilet paper hands will dissolve as soon as this girl starts getting wet and you'll just lose money all over again.

I know Melvin has done some damage and our assholes move like a blown sub and at this point, probably can't even hold in a fart. It's okay, sometimes making tendies causes grease fires and 3rd degree burns. If you want Melvin out of your guts, you better pull your head out of your own poopchute and throw up a ""Do Not Enter"" sign to prevent future mishaps.

At this point, I'm more excited to see Melvin capitulate into a ball of wrinkly old man writhing in despair and loss, than I am to see green dildos on my screen.

Also, for the last 10 times I tried to post this, it got blocked by some anti-evil bot and I've had to go back through and censor the more vulgar parts of my post. It doesn't matter because you idiots can't read anyways. Puts on reddit.

Edit 1)  First off, I have tried to post this since noon. I found that the automod was blocking the word ""quickcl0t"" of all the words in this post, which, surprisingly, took me forever to narrow down. It was initially supposed to be ""pack some gauze and quickcl0t"" but toilet paper had to suffice. I suppose it was triggering some sort of call to vi0lence bullshit so it took me forever to find out what was wrong and get this thing approved. Secondly, [/u/zjz](https://www.reddit.com/u/zjz/) and his VisualMod bot smacked me with using the banned ticker ""p-ump"" so that's why that shit looks stupid. Sorry this shit is late, I wanted ya'll to have it earlier, but fighting Melvin and reddit is a full time job. ",2021-01-09 01:51:47

"Reeeeeeeeecap of recent market driving news (Jan 8, 2021 weekend Elon chan edition)",0.96,"* Elon chan has supplanted Bezos as the richest bro in the universe. This makes all quants who kept yapping about how TSLA pricing action via option gamma squeeze will subside once it's included in S&P screech in horror. Who knew the meme stock can continue its action unabated? TSLA hits ATH almost everyday this week, closing Friday up 7.84% to $880. Unreal.

* For a succinct difference of Elon chan's prowess vs Bezos, refer to chart below:

* Morning economic numbers: nonfarm payrolls once again looking terrible, with consensus at about 50k increase but instead saw a -140k Dec. This ends a 7-month streak of steady gains in recovery. No worry fam, if you've lived thru March 2020 lows you'll know that market doesn't give a fuck about employment #s until you go all-in on calls. US reports more than 4k covid deaths for the first time ever - refer to above on why market doesn't give a fuck.

* Flurries of behind-the-scene political actions are happening as the country moves on from Y'all Qaeda's storming of the capitol. A number of high-level admin officials from policy advisors to cabinet members have bailed the sinking ship that is this current administration. Chatters of invoking 25th amendment. Second impeachment. POTUS has stated that he will NOT attend the upcoming inauguration (who knew he's a gdamn snowflake?), after finally putting out a statement that an orderly transition will occur. 

* Psuedo-SJW social media companies and platforms have banned POTUS in tandem, conveniently doing so after the Dems have clinched both chambers of Congress and will likely sit on committees regulating them. No real movements from these actions yet, though TWTR is pulling back after it banned POTUS for 12 hours until he deleted the offending Tweet. TWTR closed the day down -1.62% to $51.48, after an intraday low of more than -2%.

* BA got a slap on the wrist with a 2.5 bil fine from the DOJ for killing non-Americans. About 10% of the fine goes to the US govt while about 500 mil goes to the families of the 346 people that died in the two 737 Max crash. Remaining (70%) amount goes to BA customers because let's face it, corporations are truly the ones really hurting. BA closed down -1.32% to $209.

* It's a solid day for many Chinese ADRs as as BABA and TCEHY escape Treasury's list of delisting stonk. BABA closed up 4% for the day at $236 while TCEHY closed up 5.61% to $76.89. NIO, the TSLA of China (or is it XPEV? or LI? find out in 1.5 years!) closed up big at 8.55% to almost $59, despite offering to sell 68m more shares last month at $39. Surely the US market isn't going to be China Hustled.

* Today's big movers: DDD and PLUG continues their wild rocket moves to the stratosphere as strong market sentiment continues. DDD closed up 2.48% to $23.54, after touching an intraday high of almost 10% earlier. PLUG closed up 13% to $53.78.

* PSTH, Ackman's brainchild SPAC flew almost 12% today on ZERO news but faded towards end of the day. PSTH gang collectively jizzed and made a mess of themselves. Will it be Stripe? (it's not) Chick-fil-A? (it's not) Bloomberg? (eh they sorta denied it) Subway? (please god no). Find out eventually sometime Q1 2021 as Bill continues to edge us. Seriously Bill, announce something amazing already because I'm up more than 20k on zero news and I'm tempted to sell. PSTH closed up 7.24% to $29.32.

* In WSB meme stock land, a new law is being formed where none of these gdamn stock can go up together on the same day. PLTR faded to flat of 0.80% after being up more than 3% during early mornings, whereas GME and MT both fade some more today after a decent run-up attempt this entire week. GME close the day down -2.16% to $17.69, while MT pulls back from a week's worth of solid gain at -2.7% to $24.83. WSB's new meme ETF ICLN had some profit taking happened much to the displeasure of people who fomo into the ETF this morning, not realizing the sea of red candles were not bullish indicators. ICLN close the day down slightly to -0.75% to $33.15. Funny enough, OTM monthly calls haven't pulled back that much due to the magic of IV.

* While initially red through out most of the day, the DOW reversed course and closed up 0.18% or 56 pts, S&P up 0.55% or 20 pts, Nasdaq up a solid 1% or 134 pts, and RUT closed flat at -0.25% or -5 pts. It's the weekend and WSB newcomers addicted to FDs will no doubt flood the weekend thread, constantly asking if their $700 portfolio (funded in part by the $600 stimulus) with OTM calls will be okay. Don't worry new fam, stonk only goes up.

"Papa John's $PZZA - Make money, help franchise owners, and give Papa his company back",0.38,"First, to reduce any confusion, the company will be referred to as Papa John's and the person will be referred to as Schnatter.

I was joking about the idea to take over Papa John's with some of my friends yesterday to get Schnatter back in control of his company, and when I started doing my research I actually liked what I saw purely from an investment standpoint. This post will have two main parts: how we can get Schnatter his job back and also how we can easily make money on PZZA. We'll do the money stuff first.

&#x200B;

**Chart**

As of writing this, PZZA is currently trading at $94.10 and the ATH is $102.25. It is basically guaranteed that it will go back to the ATH. It has also sailed past the 20 and 10 day moving average, so there is no resistance until ATH. This is great for options.

https://preview.redd.it/s6klbqs2u4a61.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a797b3678678bd167818ee455dcde4d49f6e4512

&#x200B;

In addition, I suspect that PZZA could be forming a cup and handle pattern. If this plays out, the price target would be (ATH + (ATH - Bottom of Cup)), which is about $131.38. However, we won't know if this is a cup and handle until it happens.

https://preview.redd.it/umhvpr1ou4a61.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=b468ffd791469758f0679d390c4b6d72cad01a35

Even if the pattern fails, a delivery pizza restaurant is a pretty safe place for your money to be during the pandemic.

&#x200B;

**Other Numbers**

[Target price](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PZZA/research-ratings) of $104.50 with a high of $116.00. I think this is low going off the chart.

[31 million shares](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=pzza) float. I know that's a lot, but Schnatter already owns almost [1.3 million shares](https://ir.papajohns.com/stock-information/ownership-profile).

Guys, it's take out pizza in a pandemic it should really be self explanatory.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now we can talk about how Schnatter can become reinvolved with the company, which should help PZZA stock even more. As you will see, ever since he left the company has not been in as good of a position.

**Why Schnatter Left**

In 2017, he made a controversial comment about how the [NFL player protests were hurting Papa John's sales](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/22/572779230/papa-johns-ceo-steps-down-following-controversial-remarks-on-nfl) because they were the official pizza sponsor of the NFL. I don't want this to get political, but this is essential to talk about. Schnatter stepped down as CEO but remained on the board of directors. Fast forward into 2018, where Schnatter was reported to have [used a racial slur](https://www.forbes.com/sites/noahkirsch/2018/07/11/papa-johns-founder-john-schnatter-allegedly-used-n-word-on-conference-call/?sh=376e4e6e4cfc) in a meeting and it was recorded. Then, he stepped down from his position and no longer had a role in the company (besides for shareholder).

&#x200B;

**Schnatter's Fight for Innocence**

Ever since both of these allegations have surfaced, Schnatter has maintained his innocence and that his words were taken out of context. In a [recent interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lYGrUA6YjA) Schnatter had with the H3 Podcast (I know many people don't care for them, myself included, but those opinions don't change what Schnatter says in the interview) where he explained why both allegations were false. Regarding the NFL drama, Schnatter claims that he was talking about how the NFL had a leadership problem because they were not addressing the issue. [His exact words were,](https://www.foxbusiness.com/retail/ex-fbi-director-clears-papa-johns-founder-of-racial-bias-slams-clearly-inaccurate-media) ""*The NFL is hurting, and more importantly by not resolving the current debacle to the player and owner’s satisfaction, NFL leadership has hurt Papa John’s shareholders.""* In regards to the allegations of him using a racial slur, former FBI director Louis Freeh, wrote a [report](https://papajohnschnatter.report/read-the-report) where he explains how that in the phone call where he used a slur, he many times stated how he does not support any form of racism, and when he said the word, he was referring to how Colonel Sanders used it and it bothered him. There are two parts to the recording that Schnatter has been fighting in court to get released. The first part includes him using the slur and the context, and the second part includes the other people on the call celebrating after Schnatter hung up talking about how ""they got him"" and they needed to get it to the press right away. This is all according to the H3 interview. It is common sense that Schnatter would not want a recording made public that would damage him, and the company seems intent on keeping it secret, showing that they are likely hiding something.

&#x200B;

**Sales are Slumping**

[Sales are decreasing](https://www.statista.com/statistics/221441/papa-johns-total-revenue/#:~:text=Revenue%20of%20Papa%20John's%20worldwide%202007%2D2019&text=American%20pizza%20restaurant%20franchise%20Papa,seeing%20a%20decline%20in%20revenue) every year since his role as been minimized. It's as simple as that. They are in no way a failing company, they are just making less money than they were.

*Processing img 934fvr5jq4a61...*

In addition to slumping sales, in the [H3 interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lYGrUA6YjA), Schnatter claims that Papa John's total number of customers is down significantly and that the quality has decreased. He says he buys about 600 pizzas every 90 days from stores around the country to check on the quality. In my personal experience, I can say the quality at my local Papa John's has decreased over the past couple years.

&#x200B;

**Why Schnatter Can Fix This**

Schnatter is more devoted to Papa John's than most CEOs (after Karp and Elon), even though he technically doesn't work for them anymore. As I said before, he does frequent quality checks on the restaurants. The reason he does is is because he cares about the franchise owners and employees who have been negatively impacted by the new management and slumping sales. Who else still puts effort into a company after they've been fired from it? Also, this is just speculation, but since he is still closely associated with the company it is still his reputation.

&#x200B;

**What we can do**

It's simple, buy shares! If we buy enough shares of PZZA, we (along with Schnatter) can become the majority shareholder of the company. There are [just over 31 million shares float](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=pzza) and Schnatter still owns almost [1.3 million shares](https://ir.papajohns.com/stock-information/ownership-profile), or 3.88% of the company. If he can convince a few of the other large investors that it is in their best interest to see him in charge again, we can easily call a shareholder meeting, vote out those who wrongly accused him, and put him, back in charge.

&#x200B;

**Historical Implications**

Schnatter has long been touting ""The Day of Reckoning"" but has not given any hints as to if it has already happened, if it is multiple events, or what it will be specifically. If we can accomplish this, WSB would go down in history (it already has) again for giving a man his company back... and we will make money in the process. We can be the day of reckoning!

&#x200B;

**Is This Legal?**

Yes, it is perfectly legal. This would technically be a hostile takeover, which is legal, but we can just call it something else. Besides, I'm pretty sure Ryan Cohen is trying to do the same thing with Game Stop.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**

PZZA chart shows easy money, Schnatter is innocent of accusations, only he can bring Papa John's back to its former glory, and we can be the ones to do that. The Day of Reckoning is here!

before anything, this is not financial advice, go fuck yourself you autists. I am a degenerate with a hypothesis. Now that that disclaimer is done

Man blackberry, who the hell thought I’d be investing in you after the fall of BBM and Brickbreaker. Well, strap in folks as I take you through one of the most bullish stories in stonk history, and it all starts with one statement. Everything you’re thinking about with Blackberry at the moment, is wrong.

It is not a phone company. It is not telling you to use BBM. It is a software, automotive, and cybersecurity company that is about to make a killing. Let’s begin:

BB stock price, 6.71 as of Close on 1-6-2021. 

Technically, this thing is a fucking beauty. MACD flip, Stoch RSI cross, volume died on the sells and the thing is pushing up just the market died twice while it had solid momentum. This is going to move soon, but let's go away from crayons and into the magical land of make believe: news events, conferences, and fundamentals. It's not just two letters, it's a business. https://www.tradingview.com/x/uI3Cl51F/

Saw this cute image of CRWD PLTR and SNOW, all with similar or lower Revs but SNOW is half but worth 20x BB, CRWD has less revs but is operating at 11.75x, PLTR (WSB fav) has 50M more projected annual revs and is worth 11x. Alright who cares about revenue, that's only today. If only it accounted for the big event happening in the next 9 days (see news events below).

**NEWS EVENTS**

*FB settlement*

I’m not going to go into deep detail here as it is quite intricate and all I know is that BB won a suit against fuckerberg $FB related to messaging, whatsapp, and something else. $FB has till January 15th, 2020 to settle, see here: https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.331602/gov.uscourts.cand.331602.144.0.pdf 

This FB settlement is not included in earnings expectations, meaning THAT SHIT GOES UP or will be in analyst projections.

*BlackBerry IVY - Intellectual Vehicle Data Platform*

The big kahuna that will change BB for the next few years. Per BB website: “BlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.”

What does it mean to the end consumer (the automakers?)

**IVY Fueling Business Outcomes**

BlackBerry IVY will help automakers and automotive suppliers:

Fuel Innovation by supporting rapid development of new customer experiences
Drive Revenue by unlocking new revenue streams and business models
Reduce Costs by moving processing to the edge & reducing raw data transmission
Improve Operations with enhanced data visibility and access
Expand Ecosystems by unlocking the broader app developer community

Want a TL;DR? Automotive, cloud, cybersecurity, IOT, electric vehicles, every bubble on the planet. And this shit got all of it. Want more info? https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws Read this and watch their conferences coming up.

**Partnerships with big companies**

Blackberry partnered with Zoom (link: https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/10/blackberry-and-zoom-together-secure-your-virtual-enterprise-meetings), Microsoft Teams (link: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management-301147559.html) and some other company that I forgot. Cybersecurity adding onto big big platforms that exploded this past year. MORE MONEY you dumbasses.

Patents
BB started offloading old patents but have one that will be important as of recent, with the sexiest one being this: https://uspto.report/patent/grant/10880812 

Very pretty stuff, big sex.


**Business Implications**

BB makes their money from licensing, cybersecurity (one of the only companies that have not been hacked in this SolarWind shit), BB QNX is already in 175 MM cars worldwide, partnered with XPEV, and is in talks with multiple Tier 1 automakers, 20 different OEMs, and will be in vehicles by 2023. Does that mean anything now? Yes, you dumbass. Per CEO John Chen, my new president, #DidYouKnow @BlackBerry has been selected by 19 of the top 25 #ElectricVehicle manufacturers, and they represent 61% of the Electric Vehicle market?

Bubblicious and sexy. Expect some of the big tier 1s like Nissan, Toyota, BMW, and others to jump on this train. Think TSLA doesn’t have competition? Bitch they cant even make a billion dollars unless they sell stock (which since MS just upgraded their price, I bet they offer at least $5B in stock in the coming days).

Needham’s 23rd Annual Virtual Growth Conference 
Friday, January 15th, 2021 at 1:15 pm ET 
With Ryan Permeh, Blackberry Chief Security Architect & Co-founder of Cylance and Eric Cornelius, Blackberry Chief Product Architect 

This was just announced and you bet your ass this will pump this stock up.



**Conclusion:**

This stock will generate a lot more cash in the coming years, will gain in the short term by offloading old patents, settling with FB and getting some moolah, growing in their partnership with Bezos gang, roll out to more EVs with Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive companies, and compete with Tesla on this as well. This shit trades at $6.70 and is so close to going up if the market just doesn’t crash in the interim. They already are used by big companies for Access and other Mobile applications, so that someone can securely use their dinky iPhone to work. Think big whales aren’t interested? Look at 2022 2023 option OI. 

I think this goes to lower PT of $10 by May, more likely $15. uThInKitWiLLdOUbleINmKTcAp???? Yes you fucking idiot, this is trading at 4X sales only, will be profitable this year, and has so much shit coming up. This is UNDER 4B!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just buy the stock and sit on it. Want options? Buy them too. Have fun guys, I hope you all make money.

"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news (Jan 6, 2021 after market close)",0.98,"(*Editor's note: It's a [wild day](https://d2qig04bry9arv.cloudfront.net/uploads/2014/04/roller-coaster.jpg) for the market and the country, and I will try to be as neutral as possible despite the fuckery afoot)*.

* Dems clinched the GA Senate run-off election as Warnock defeats Loeffler while Ossoff defeats Perdue (the first millennial Senator). As the results became more clear last night, futures took a deep dive particularly for NQ, while conversely small caps enjoys a favorable bump. The market opened deeply red for QQQ as big tech retreated with renew fear on antitrust probes  and overall an unfriendly corporate environment as Democrats will control WH and both chambers of Congress. 

* By early morning, the sell-off quickly reversed and big tech recovered most of their red, with big tech such as AAPL going from -3% to just shy of yesterday's close during day's high. In contrast to big tech, clean tech and weed soared on Dems securing the Senate. ICLN was up almost 4% during pre-market and as high as 9% during intraday high and HASI was up 10% during intraday high. Weed stock such as TLRY was up as high as 21%, ACB as high as 11%+, and APHA as high as 14%.

* Things quickly pulled back and tech started fading in earnest at 2:15 PM ET when protestors [cosplaying as revolutionaries](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106820104-1609961746992-gettyimages-1230453313-AFP_8YA6MW.jpg) stormed the capitol and Congress had to quickly pause their certifying of the Electoral College votes. Shit got real when a lady got shot as these protestors attempt to storm the [barricaded House chamber](https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1600/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F210106150417-03-house-chamber-0106.jpg) while Reps were still in the building.

* The sell-off accelerated for AAPL, AMZN, FB, MSFT, and NFLX as most drilled back to opening lows by EOD. AAPL closed the day -3.37% to $126.60, AMZN -2.49% to $3,138, FB -2.83% to $263, MSFT -2.59% to $212, and NFLX -3.9% to $500.49. Thanks to overall negative sentiment of all things tech, QQQ closed the day red at -1.39% to $307 (retreating quite a bit more than IXIC given the weigh of big tech in QQQ).

* Morning economic numbers had ADP reporting payrolls dropping to 123k in Dec, slightly below consensus of 130k. PMI was at 54.8 while consensus was 55.3, while factory order was up 1.0% MoM. Thankfully, none of these number fucking matters as the Dow, SPY, and IWM proceed to sky rocket with the market looking forward to stronger spending and stimulus from a Dem controlled govt.

* Beyond weed, clean tech, and infrastructure - financial sector killed it today in particular mid-cap banks such as ZION (up 11.24%), CNC (up 9.81%), and KEY (up 9.73%). You'll find a similar story for large-cap bank stock with JPM closing up 4.70%, BAC up 6.25%, C up 5.75%, and WFC up 7.08%. It's a good thing I've already dumped my reopening [WFC leaps play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kftjzt/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/ggarcbi/) of $25c and $30c which are now fucking ITM by $3~$8 and still have a year left to go on them. Nice.

* In yet another confusing about-face and showing a real Karen spunk, the NYSE is *really* delisting the three Chinese telecoms this time. The real kicker though came in at 2:25 PM ET when news broke that US officials are considering *more* Chinese stock delisting, adding Chinese big tech Alibaba, Tencent, et al. to the potential list. A sea of red soon followed to compound the sell-off as BABA crater to the Earth's core and closed down -5.32%. Following suit, PDD closed down -5.58%, JD down -7.66%, and the same goes for Chinese EV NIO at -5% and XPEV at -2.62%. LI escapes semi-unscathed and closed the day up 2.48% thanks to a new BofA coverage with a Buy rating and a PT of $42.

* In WSB meme stock land, GME was on track for a solid 8-9% day until the storming of the capitol occurred, PLTR's fade accelerated further while MT stays modestly flat, bouncing back from the overall market sell off. GME closed up 5.70% to $18.36, PLTR closed down -4.31% to $23.54, and MT closed up 0.32% to $24.70. ICLN, a new WSB favorite due to new balance of power in Congress might be added to future roundup if it continues to pump. Imagine that, a clean energy boomer ETF becoming a meme stock. The iShares fund managers are probably wondering why their alerts going tits up with social media mentions and sentiment brewing.

* Random trade ideas (these are not financial advice and if it goes wrong that's your own gdamn fault):

    1) FSLY leaps Jan 2022 90c or 100c+ for eventual TikTok climbing back fully onto the service as ByteDance pointedly makes a political jab at outgoing administration. Headwind on this retarded play: cloud/stay-at-home stock continues to take a beating as rona gets under control as vaccine roll out picks up. 

    2) Sell AAPL cash secured puts Jan 15 120p to 122p if the big tech fade continues rest of the week. These ~0.18 to 0.24 delta strikes are likely safe enough and if assigned, you'll have an upcoming ER on Jan 26 to sell IV pumped covered calls to get out of the trade intact. Feb 19 puts are likely okay to sell as well given you'll receive much more premium from the ~43 dte chains. Headwinds on this retarded play: its CSP and CC. As boomer as it gets. 

    3) BABA leaps and/or March debit call spread for another bounce in a wild trading week for BABA. March 230c/250c is probably a sufficient spread while baking in a bit of IV via ER which is on Feb 11. Jan 230c to 250c if you're not poor. Headwind on this retarded play: Jack Ma really is missing and the US govt really will delist a 600 bil market cap Chinese ADR, forcing out all major US institution holders. Yeah, right.

* The DOW closed up 1.44% or 437 pts, Nasdaq down -0.61% or -78 pts, S&P up 0.57% or 21 pts, and RUT closed up 3.98% (!!) or 78 pts. Stay in school kids and avoid storming federal buildings or Twitter will start banning your fucking account. (TWTR locks POTUS account for 12 hrs and is down -1.99% AH).

💎💎 Foundry rolled into Japan $PLTR💎💎,0.97," So PLTR has rolled out in Japan, their first contracts are starting to appear and Fujitsu Limited kicked off with Foundry. Not a big contract ($8M) but a good example to follow. I don't expact PLTR to moon from this news, but it is nice to see contracts being signed. 

 

Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) announced today it was expanding its work with Fujitsu with a one-year, $8,000,000 contract between Fujitsu and Palantir Technologies Japan K.K. Fujitsu will also become the first distributor of Palantir’s Foundry platform modules in the Japanese market.

Fujitsu has used Palantir Foundry since last year to optimize its hardware supply chain, further improve its customer service efforts, and modernize its technological infrastructure, and will continue to do so until at least the end of 2021. Fujitsu will also become the first distributor within Japan of [ERP Suite](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.palantir.com%2Fjapan%2Fen.html&esheet=52356376&newsitemid=20210106005230&lan=en-US&anchor=ERP+Suite&index=1&md5=631723c5d36cc6743ca3ca8fd7410e36), a Palantir Foundry module. Fujitsu is already using ERP Suite internally to integrate its ERP systems with other critical systems of record. This new module distribution channel will be accompanied by a Foundry certification program for Fujitsu’s DX services business.

Fujitsu’s distribution of Foundry modules will build on the company’s existing support of customers in their digital transformation journeys, as well as its experience working with large commercial institutions and all branches of the Japanese government.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GME (Long term Bullish) - If you're not already in GME then I don't recommend playing until you see a break at 18.10 (ish) with heavy volume. If it breaks resistance look out for 18.97-19.74-20.5 range.

If current support fails, look GME to fill a gap at 16.55-15.77 range. If it breaks 15.77 support then we f'ed. Watchout for 14.5-13.50. Anything below 13.5 and that means Cohen probably died or something.

If it breaks 19.74 then we moon to 21-23 range for this week.

TSLA (Bullish): Expecting TSLA to head down to 748 range since it mooned after hours and is near resistance BUT it could hit 757-765-770 because it's TSLA. If green support line fails we could see 740-733-731 area but would need catalyst and volume. If it breaks out of support with no volume then it could trade around no-man's land for the rest of the week while our calles get the theta treatment.

AMD (bullish for earning run): If AMD breaks 93.20 with volume then look out for 95-97.99 range. If it bounce off 93.20 resistance with volume then look out for 91.55-89.55.

Nokia - A truly retarded DD,0.9,"I just want to preface this with saying you guys are fucking retards for going all in on GME and I love it.

Unfortunately, my love and what very little money I can come across does not belong to inflating a company that has robbed people for so long.

This all said, I am here to share with you the only major hunch and play I got left; Nokia. I feel like it is severely undervalued, and for what it's worth, this is a chart-specific play...

9/15/2014, a bullish correction/impulse tops out at $8.73.

&#x200B;

10/14/2013, Nokia broke above the red 200 MA, and on 8/24/2015 had a successful retest of it for support.

&#x200B;

Between 02/08/2016 and 04/18/2016, Nokia fought to stay above the red 200w MA.

On the week of 04/18/2016, Nokia produced a bearish doji candle at the red 200w MA and finally succumbed to large sell volume from gay bears confirming it as resistance.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vawm55ouwm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=f887e9f69e05c193357ff0e0585a60dee3fc1cc5

Since that candle, the price of Nokia has fluctuated in a large, 2,009 day range between a high of $6.65 and a low of $2.34.

The 200w MA has been tested and rejected 6 times, with the most recent occurrence being on the trading week of 08/03/2020.

\-Fibonnaci analysis-

Nokia has stair-stepped down from one Fib to the next ever since confirming the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement as resistance on the week of 01/25/2016.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o6dbdwivwm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=91bc2178b0c8d05b56705413ae1901dc2b01517c

&#x200B;

Nokia then struggled from 02/01/2016 to 07/22/2019 for 1,267 days with breaking and staying above the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement. The 0.382 retracement during this time frame was also roughly the same area the red 200w MA resided, which provided confluence for the gay bears.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j9xzweewwm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=45f488b30cf0f9d122c775298800ea52b84e3cda

11/14/2016, Nokia very briefly broke below the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement and was very rapidly brought back up to test the red 200w MA. This major test of resistance was, yet again, a failure. From this moment forward Nokia was only able to genuinely break above the red 200w MA one time, 01/07/2019. After ranging above it for only a few short months, Nokia broke below and a subsequent retest caused a massive 42.29% drop in less than 4 months.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/etvy6bvwwm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e6f46a8038b393789966aa751c2d4bfa39145da

For approximately 3 months afterwards, Nokia attempted to regain upward traction. It was rejected immediately as soon as it hit the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, causing yet another major 48.34% selloff from Covid fears. This selloff yielded a low of $2.34, the lowest share price it has had in approximately 2,750 days. On the week of 07/27/2020, Nokia was able to again very briefly break above the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. After producing a low volume bull flag below the 200w MA, it was rejected to a low of $3.21. Since the Covid price of  $2.34, $3.21 has so far been the next higher low for Nokia and has since produced another fairly low volume bull flag.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z1lrfnj1xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=1854900a6c47ecb596d43eaf8643da4d8cc595cd

&#x200B;

For the retards like myself who can't maff very well, 2,750 days comes out to 7.53 years. During Covid, Nokia hit a fucking low that it has not seen in over SEVEN POINT FIVE YEARS. SEVEN POINT FIVE YEARS.

&#x200B;

\-RSI analysis-

This is where shit gets fucking \*interesting\*.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vwh8jmx1xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=a60db103050a04f08ff4ed4bb5773714a3e8f931

This is the weekly timeframe.

Notice the trendline. On 9 different occasions, Nokia has attempted to break above it only to be rejected and fail support tests.

On the 10th occasion, Nokia was able to have a minor breakout, successfully retest the trendline, and have a significant rise thereafter.

The 10th occasion has so far been the longest Nokia has been able to stay above this trendline, with 2 major successful tests of support.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1d2l1wc2xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=583631d853cc314794e4524fbe1979b9905d5d33

It is now battling with the bullish 50 RSI area for the 3rd time. Each of two prior tests of 50 RSI also coincided with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. That means this is a major zone.

After breaking back below the 0.618, the RSI trendline was successfully tested for support. It then bearfagged back up to the 0.618, only to nosedive on a high volume dump.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hx7jsnp2xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=54cefc4accb3d4ba9cdb8aab9cfdb686b27c234a

This is the 2 week RSI.

Notice how on 3 separate occasions, 60 RSI has so far been rejected. The first two occasions were roughly the same price point, while the third occasion was with a significantly lower high.

This shows hidden bearish divergence, which was likely a major reason for the price to have dumped so hard from its local high. One thing I have learned about hidden bearish divergence is that it is often an early indicator of buyer strength. It pretty much always results in a retracement, but thereafter, a fairly large rise. This occasion is so far clearly no different.

Notice also that there is significant bullish divergence in the RSI.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d5utlt63xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=500b6016b6dd1b8524e851ebd150168dac68bf67

&#x200B;

This is the 2 month RSI.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w8ck0em3xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=77b1582663e94cf7e91bb22587f1751a0f3855f0

50 RSI is getting hardcore rejected every time price causes the RSI to go anywhere near it. This is a strong indicator in my experience of accumulation.

The moment 50 RSI breaks on the 2 month RSI and there will likely be a very, very parabolic amount of buying support.

&#x200B;

My second favorite of this TA: the 3 month RSI.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i2z7gn04xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=71b056135b91044375d9f96ea8b502a230d4ec0a

40 RSI absolutely refuses to break, but hey, it has on a few different occasions. Notice the reactions in price however whenever 40 RSI breaks.

Price moons.

After a bullish engulfing candle starting 04/01/2020, 2 subsequent 3 month candles have so far been rejected at entering below 40 RSI, one of which having a very long tail and closing as a long legged doji. This is another strong indicator of reversal aka buying support. They also coincide with the 0.786 and near perfect closes below the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement.

Someone is accumulating.

&#x200B;

\-Patterns-

And now, my favorite part of this TA.

Have you been wondering what the big ass white line is for in some of my screenshots, or do you already know? They say when something is too good to be true, it almost always is. I won't ever give up hope that it isn't, however.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tm5z6lf4xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4451933afe22fdd8e8874ea3350f9c3c92dac3b

&#x200B;

There are 2 white lines in this screenshot. Both are what I believe \*could be\* inverted head and shoulders patterns. If either one of them completes, they can very very easily jump start the next rise in this asset.

If the small one completes, the target for it will be the 7th time contending with the 200w MA residing currently at $5.07.

If both of them complete, Nokia has a minimum price target of roughly $9. IF however the $9 target is met, it will have over doubled the current price for this stock. That \*will\* cause FOMO.

I will admit, I've had not the greatest luck in spotting real inverted head and shoulders patterns. They let me down alot. :()

&#x200B;

Long story short, 1/20/22 leaps are currently at $13/$14 a piece right now on Robinhood.

If you pay $14 for a 12 month leap contract, you're essentially 'betting' $1.1666 per month that Nokia will make you money.

I find it incredibly difficult to believe you won't make at least SOME money on this play.

Especially considering months ago, this particular contract bottomed out at $0.12. It just did it again. Double bottom?

&#x200B;

I apologize ahead of time if anything seems off, I have checked and double checked this TA to make sure screenshots are accurate, etc..but I'm far from perfect. I guarantee you I fucked something up.

anyway, buy Nokia while you're waiting on GME or PLTR or NIO or whatever. Think deep in your thoughts what constitutes a *real* meme stock and **NOKIA?** ...

$GOEV IS FORGOTTEN?,0.92,"I have been lurking here since late November. I never expected to be here, but I found myself in an awkward position as an individual who went all-in on $PLTR at its IPO in September. I did some 'research' after the huge run up and ended up here, with the meme stocks. Apperently, my senses happen to coincide with complete and utter autism. 

Since then, I have found the investor presentation from August for '$HCAC' aka '$GOEV' aka Canoo. I went in hard on the company, as I believe in the vision and direction, but I must admit I am discouraged with the recent downturn.

Does anyone have a solid reason for the downturn? Or have any input on thier own beliefs? I still believe in this company, but I have no idea why the crash happened, other than paper hands taking short-term profits.

Tldr: Why GOEV low? Why not high?

BUY ALIBABA... you're an idiot if you don't.,0.77,"Alibaba is so fucking oversold it is not even funny. PLTR and NIO are great and all but this is an opportunity to fucking ride large cap to the moon. I don't give a shit about China ""investigating"" Alibaba. They are the face of their country's technological push and essential for worldwide dominance in tech (China's goal). They reached 18.8 on the RSI last week and anything under 30 is considered oversold. They have 4 times the earnings of Amazon yet their Market Cap is 650 billion instead of 1.6 trillion. Their fair value is at 350 a share, analyst price targets are up to 400. If you want some free fucking money, go buy some fucking calls or shares. See you at the moon.

Iron hands, sell stratospheric.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

My apologies on the revenue numbers being off, definitely my bad, however, I stand by the rest of my comments till the day I die. Jack Ma's disappearance isn't great, but has 0 affect on Alibaba's operations. He already resigned as chairman and therefore has no bearing on the future of Alibaba. His connection to Alibaba is the same as Bill Gates to Microsoft. They both own a shit ton of shares but no longer are directly involved with the company's doings.",2021-01-05 03:39:01

That’s right $PLTR 50C EOY 🚀 🌙,1.0,,2021-01-05 01:02:18
Me logging on robinhood to see PLTR hasn’t moved today,1.0,,2021-01-04 22:54:22
Great Leap Ideas for 2021 - BTFD,0.91,"Stocks broadly dipped today (Jan 4), and tomorrow, the positions will likely dip further because of uncertainty over the GA runoff elections. But fear not and BTFD. Here're some top picks:  


1. NIO. Just released its December 2020 delivery numbers yesterday, and as expected, they killed it. 121% increase in deliveries for 2020. Deliveries doubled year-over-year. There are also rumors that Nio will open its first non-Chinese store in Copenhagen, Denmark. It's comfortably over $50 today. I predict $60+ by Nio Day. Furthermore, I predict over $100 by eoy. Anything below $45 looks good rn. Weeklies might be worth it, but to be safe, go for leaps.   

2. JMIA. This is the African Alibaba-Amazon. I'm being a touch anecdotal, but I bought BABA when it was $60/share, and while waiting for its meteoric rise, BABA received the same criticism 12 years ago that JMIA is getting now (\[China's\] infrastructure is weak! They're not tech-savvy! They're not revenue positive!), I also see parallel upsides: JMIA knows its customers. It services over 12 countries and has a customer base of 1.2-Billion people. That's more customers than what Alibaba has in China. Furthermore, JMIA's platform has a payment system like Alipay, a food delivery service like DoorDash, and a travel booking service like Expedia all bundled in one platform that happens to also be one of the most popular websites/mobile apps in Africa.   
JMIA will monopolize many industries in the large and rapidly growing continent of Africa. MasterCard and Goldman Sachs are some of their investors. The two co-ceo's (Europeans) formerly worked at McKinsey, and their African co-founder is a Harvard MBA alum and successful entrepreneur. Fun fact: Alibaba outcompeted Ebay in China and became the de facto local E-commerce provider. Similarly, JMIA out-competed Amazon and Alibaba to be the most popular platform in Africa.    

3. PLTR. The stock price will suck for a couple of months, but hear me out. Compared to its share price, the covered call premiums are juicy. I have 1000 shares and make around 300 - 700 a week from holding them. I don't mind holding for the long term because of the enormous upside. Most of PLTR's current clients are government groups like the US Military, the FBI, and the Greek Government, but they plan to increasingly expand their services to private companies under the ""Foundry"" Platform, which is projected to have a market size of $56B. According to the PLTR website, Foundry will serve ""approximately 6,000 companies with more than $500-million in annual revenue"". It's no wonder CEO Alex Karp said investors will be ""pleasantly surprised."" It might dip below 20 near-term, but hold for the long-term tendies. 

Again, the above three stocks will likely suffer from the GA Senate runoff election's volatility, but these are opportunities to load up on more shares and/or buy leaps. We're still in a Fed-fueled secular bull market. A republican senate would be favorable for stocks, but I think NIO and PLTR in particular will have an overall favorable increase under a blue wave, while JMIA is just too similar to Alibaba to ignore right now. They are one earnings-beat away from mooning. 

Was bored and made a short vid based on these positions:

A look into your future after YOLOing your life savings on PLTR and GME calls 🚀🚀🚀,0.95,,2021-01-04 22:06:40
"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's (and recent) market driving news (Jan 4, 2021 after market close)",0.99,"* 2021 starts off with a bang as VIX shoots up an ungodly 22%+ during intraday high. During intraday low for the market, the Dow was down as much as -700 pts (-2.3%), Nasdaq -345 pts (-2.6%), and S&P -94 (-2.5%). WSB reeled in horror as stonk somehow doesn't always go up. Beyond renewed COVID fear, market sell-off accelerated in the morning after 10 AM as the market continues to keep an eye on the GA run-off election with polls increasingly being more favorable for the DNC candidates. No doubt an extra wrench was thrown to the GA GOP Senate campaigns as POTUS continues to pressure GA officials on figuring out votes - cuz that's totes normal thing for a sitting President to do.

* For those WSBer who failed basic HS civics class, just one GOP win in the two run-off Senate seats will keep Biden's more progressive agenda at bay (and likely the recent tax cut intact) as the GOP and McTurtle retain control of the Senate. Conversely, Dems winning both seats will secure both legislative branch for Dems, as VP Harris be the tie breaking vote in the Senate. Will this mean an eventual bigger stimulus package? A renew market-sell off? Should ANTM, UNH, and others quiver in fear? Find out later this week as results will unlikely be clear even after polls are close on Tues night.

* With renewed COVID fear as the UK variant likely running rampant undetected in the US, shares of travel sector are pressured today. In airlines, AAL closed down -4% to $15.13, UAL -3.75% to $41.63, and LUV -3.37% to $45.04 (similar price action across the sector for JBLU, SAVE, etc.). Cruise stocks took a bigger beating with NCLH down -6.69% to $23.73, RCL down -5.23% to $70.72, and CCL down -5.91% to $20.38. Conversely, safe plays and essential stores such as WMT, TGT, and COST are all up today at 1.65%, 0.62%, and 0.89% despite S&P being red.

* Jack Ma, Alibaba's very public CEO has reportedly been missing in action in the past few months as speculation starts floating about his disappearance due to the CCP. While memes float about of Ma being tucked away in a Chinese state prison with Randy Marsh due to pissing off Pooh Bear, shares of BABA continues to be pressured despite a rebound last week as CCP's antitrust probe on both Alibaba and its subsidiary Ant Group chugs on. BABA closed the day -2.10% at $227.85, while competitors PDD closed -6.13% to $166.78, and JD closed the day -1.79% at $86.33. 

*  QS, the SPAC turned meme EV stock took a nice more than -40% dive today as shares sold off on... well, who the fuck knows why it sold off (PIPE shares became available and are no longer locked? I didn't look into the lockup period, someone let me know the dates). The EV battery maker took on a NKLA-like trajectory and rallied as high as $120 before steadily trimming its gains in the past week. For those who are adventurous in selling the IV, OTM Jan 15 puts such as 35p are going for $1.55 while 40p are going for $3.3. But honestly, do you really want to baghold QS at those pricing if assigned (cash secured)? Go with a spread, you dumb fuck. Shares closed the day down more than $34 (-40.84%) to $49.96. If you sold puts before today, you dun goofed.

* QS edit: thanks to trojanattorney1 [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqi8e8/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_and_recent_market_driving/gi48nvd/): more early investor shares were available today and millions were dumped into the market. If you're trying to catch the QS knife, be warned as there are many more dilution to go. You can check recent filing [here](https://sec.report/Ticker/QS) if you're so inclined.

*  Haven, the AMZN + BRK + JPM venture in ""disrupting"" health care has disbanded after a 3 year attempt. Turns out having sensible health care in America is hard as fuck. Shares of healthcare companies UNH, HUM, et al. were up during pre-market and morning hours, but faded through the day as overall macro pushed the sector down.

*  In more ""I thought this is America"" news, more than 200 GOOGL employees and contractors in both the US and Canada have decided to unionized to promote a less shitty workplace and ethical business practices (once a upon a time, Google's motto was ""Do No Evil.""). Collectively known as the Alphabet Workers Union, the group's aim is to start small and eventually amass enough membership to actually address some of the more lofty goals: namely pay and working conditions. GOOGL closed the day down -1.51%, though more likely due to overall macro than this thus far non-material news.

*  Elon chan and his meme stock continues to kill whatever remaining short sellers are left, as TSLA reaches new ATH after Q4 delivery report. Despite the FY number being ""missed"" by 450 vehicles, the quarterly delivery of 180,570 vehicles handily beat Wall Street's estimate of about 174k vehicles and shares are up bigly to close up 3.42% at $729.77. How did we ever doubt those WSB degens who loaded up $3,500 strike Jan 15 calls pre-split which are now ITM!? Truly, they were ahead of the times in knowing that TSLA will shoot up an additional 76% in the next 3 months.

*  On Chinese EV side of things, NIO delivered 7k vehicles in Dec 2020 while XPEV delivered 5,700 vehicles - both numbers are record ""growth"" for the two company which shows a YoY growth of 121% for NIO and 326% for XPEV. (WSB with OTM FDs know these ""growth"" well as their FDs goes from 100% in value but are still down all-time of at -85%). NIO closed the day up 9.75% to $53.49 and XPEV trimmed their intraday high of 10%+ to close up 2.97% at $44.10.

*  In WSB meme stock land, things are a fairly mixed bag as GME continues to fade after reaching a recent 52-week high of $22.35. The definitely-not-going-bankrupt gaming retailer closed the day down -8.44% to $17.25. PLTR, despite being up more than 2% in pre-market, closed the day relatively flat at -0.76% to $23.37. Finally, steel gang got a respite today as MT closed the day up 4.59%, though intraday high was up as much as 8%.

*  Looking for cheap and relatively ""responsible"" WSB meme stock play? You can do GME covered call and sell April 35c for about $1.6 (though selling on a green day for $2+ is probably a better idea). This will net you 100 shares of GME for less than $15.70 per share and cap your imaginary gains at $35 if the squeeze does happen. (All those GME DDs can't be wrong?)  Conversely, you can go with GME April 20c/35c debit call spread for a ""low price"" of $2.4 per spread, or for those who prefer to sell FDs to fellow WSBer, poor man's covered call of Jan 2022 $25c and selling weeklies and/or April 35c will suffice. At the end of the day, the fact that April 35c has so much value still to it should be taken advantage if GME has a green day. For MT, June debit call spread is probably the way to go, with 25c/35c a possible spread. These are not financial advice and if you listen to a random stranger online and lose your pants on the play - then that's on you, you dumb stupid motherfucker.

*  DJI closed down -382 pts (-1.25%), IXIC closed down -189 pts (-1.47%), SPX -55 pts (-1.48%), and RUT is down -28 pts (-1.47%). Notable numbers and ERs this week: ISM manufacturing index tomorrow at 10 AM ET, BBBY reports on Thursday before market opens while MU reports after market close. Load up on those MU 90c for 7/20 - this time it'll definitely hit!

(Last week's recap: none cuz I was enjoying a NYE covid yacht party. There's [last Wednesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kmmuco/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_december_30_2020/ghflbei/) if you want to read that).",2021-01-04 21:19:21

Why BNGO will be your bingo ticket to the 🚀,0.89,"Bionano Geonomics (BNGO)


Let’s start with cathie wood at Ark. She has already stated that genomics will be the future in terms of tech development. ARKG is heavily invested into PACB which is BNGO’s competitor. 

BNGO recently released that their product Saphyr is now 30%ish more efficient than PACB’s product.

PACB’s market cap is 4.9B

BNGO current market cap as of this writing trading at 6.58 which leaves them at 1B market cap.

Assume similar price trajectory to PACB’s market puts this at 4.9x of its current share valuation. Which puts this around $32.00/share!!

BNGO is waiting on FDA approval right now which could be further catalyst and reason for Cathie to enter. 

BNGO got an extension of nasdaq delisting by 6months a few weeks ago which at this point no longer matters. (This means BNGO needs to trade above $1.00 consistently for 10 trading days to meet compliance) 

I recommend buying now. Load up. Anywhere between 2-5 is sexy. I expect a small dip

My current positions: 500shares averaged at 2.73$/share

My strategy is to sell a quarter of my position at $10 and let the rest ride long term. If this dips anywhere below 3 again, I am adding more to my shares

First DD so do your own research! Tbh, I’ve never felt more confident about this. 

EDIT 1: This is posted after the run up to fit the market cap requirement of 1B that this sub requires prior to posting or auto removal. 

EDIT 2: I am being told in the comments that PACB is actually complimentary to BNGO's technology. This makes me even more bullish & likely that Cathy would invest in this game changing tech. 

EDIT 3: A team member from ARKG (Cathie's fund for Genomics investing) has already contacted BNGO via Twitter. 

EDIT 4: Previous TESLA EXEC (Christopher Stewart) joined BNGO as CFO - news reported Aug 2020

TLDR: buy BNGO before you miss the boat.

PLTR Valuation Lies,0.92,"Don't listen to the analyst's lies or the articles about valuation. The concept of valuation is being used as a weapon against you and right now the only reason PLTR 🚀 stock is dropping is because of:

1. Heavy short interest with 70M (as of early December) shares sold short out of \~500m lockup float.
2. Tards losing money on the massive amount of weekly call buying.

&#x200B;

PLTR🚀 is a good company and the institutions know it. Back in 2018 Morgan Stanley was saying that their IPO in 2020 should be 36-41B ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-18/palantir-weighs-ipo-valued-at-as-much-as-41-billion-wsj-says](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-18/palantir-weighs-ipo-valued-at-as-much-as-41-billion-wsj-says)). This price was based off of projections using growth numbers from back in 2018. We know that growth has picked up a bit. As of last Thursday PLTR 🚀 is currently valued at 41B but the last PT and ""downgrade"" Morgan Stanley gave was  a $17 or a 30B market cap.

&#x200B;

"Ten(die) Traits of the TENBAGGER ($PLTR, $RKT, $TSLA)",0.85," Fellow smooth brains, broke boiz, and gainz girls,

I've had a lot of down time this week since I'm cooped up in q-tine with the vid. Figured I'd change it up and spend time to listen and read about people who actually made money in the markets, instead of edging to EOY loss porn for 10 days straight.

I found a few different hedge fund daddies to keep me company during the alt reality of rona isolation. These dudes weren't smooth brain; they read books and wrote them too. They made all their tendies in the pre-dawn era before the internet, but a lot of their concepts are the foundations of today's DD flair.

One of these hedge fund daddies is Peter Lynch; the silver fox averaged 30% returns over 13 years as manager of Fidelity's Magellan Fund. He frequently & routinely states ""Stonks only go up"" and ""Buy the FKN DIP"" in pre-internet era interviews and he's got a rager for the market advantages of individuals (retail, us, idiots) vs. wall street (chads, citron, warren buffet). He actually walked away from Wall Street at relatively young age to spend more time with his family. This decision can only be interpreted one way; he made enough tendies to send his wife's boyfriend back to instructing $PTON classes and preying on other men's wives. For this, the legacy of he Silver Fox must be immortalized - he is legend.

Anyway, Lynch is pretty famous for coining the characteristics (traits) of a ten bagger. Since I've got lots of time and there's no loss porn on the weekends, I thought it would be an interesting idea to back test some of these ideas on WSB favorites & active bag holders like $RKT, $PLTR, and $TSLA.

**10 Traits of a Ten Bagger:**

**1. Name is Dull or Ridiculous: All tickers check.**

· Red $RKT? Sheesh dude calm down.

· $PLTR? Fool of a took!

· $TSLA? That socialist electrician?

**2. It does something dull: All tickers check.**

· $RKT: Mortgage loan processing.

· $PLTR: Data aggregation & integration. wut?

· $TSLA: Sells cars.

**3. It Does something disagreeable: All tickers check.**

· $RKT: Online loan processing is perceived as untrustworthy by institutions & individuals.

· $PLTR: Blah blah blah oppression, NSA & data privacy

· $TSLA: ""There will never be a market for EVs!""

**4. Institutions don't own & analysts don't follow: Only $PLTR checks.**

· $RKT: 15 analysts have coverage with an avg. PT of $24.7

· $PLTR: 7 analysts have coverage with an avg. PT of $15

· $TSLA: Everyone talkin' TSLA these days. Irrelevant.

**5. It's depressing: All 3 tickers check with some massaging of the interpretation.**

· $RKT: When I grew up, home loan refinancing was a bad thing borne from necessity. Exchanging equity for better loan terms prolongs payments and adds long-term interest. These improve affordability and increase in popularity with each recession.

· $PLTR: Literally sells system solutions for crisis situations. Think COVID/Conflict/Fraud.

· $TSLA: The narrative sells because the climate crisis is the defining issue of our age.

**6. The industry isn't growing: All 3 check with some massaging of the interpretation.**

· $RKT: Growth is not the same as appreciation. The housing market continues to spike in part because of archaic housing & city planning policies that prevent new supply from entering markets.

· $PLTR: New data points & software solutions continue to be introduced & sold, but PLTR is unique in it's integration & aggregation capabilities. Nobody else is selling this particular solution; in fact, PLTR views their biggest competition as a companies' desire to internalize this solution.

· $TSLA: EVs sales are in fact growing exponentially, however the sales are pulling demand from the existing market share of the automobile industry, not creating new market share. Additionally, modern transportation policy ***likely*** reduces the amount of new cars on the road as EVs are increasingly exposed as an edge case for addressing climate change. Also, ARK (momma Wood) has done a bunch of research re: the pending used-car bubble that will put further ownership equity pressure on loans, dealers, and individuals still buying used ICE cars. The combined pressures of costs associated with personal vehicle ownership, rapid asset depreciation, autonomous ride hailing, modern transpo plans focused on decreased congestion & emissions, will significantly reduce the size of this industry in the near/mid term future.

o P.S. I <3 Pete Bootycheeks, US Transpo Sec. Build all the rails & bike lanes.

**7. It's got a NICHE: All 3 check.**

· $RKT: mobile loan processing. Speed speed speed. Ease ease ease. Cheese cheese cheese. $RKT's solutions saves time, better prepare buyers & refinancers, simplifies the process, and reduces monthly expense. Rock solid like my $RKT in the mornings.

· $PLTR: how many of you work at a fortune 500 (not Wendy’s) that requires you to query data for routine reports? How many logins do you have? how many systems do you need to navigate? Do you know how your co addresses this? They pay managers who can't write =sumif() excel functions, to piece together PowerPoints and workflow diagrams that communicate system enhancements to $100k+ soft devs and system architects who then Frankenstein together 10+ paid SAAS ""solutions"" in 1-3 years. $PLTR comes in hot and ready like the domineos pizza pie delivery guy ready to feed & seed the shmeat lovers. $PLTR works with what you got, growers and showers, to create a highly scalable 2 way data integration & aggregation system in hours.

· $TSLA: Battery & self driving tech are the biggest niches at this point, but don't sleep on those EV credits. Wall street industry idiots are salty that $TSLA can improve margins by selling polluter permission slips to allow polluters to pollute, but co's love to pollute so those things print.

**8. Recurring Revenues: All 3 check.**

· $RKT: Definition of ""Recurring"": ""occurring again periodically or repeatedly."" $RKT reports a lot of money each quarter's earnings reports. Don't @ me.

· $PLTR: the business model is designed to scale billing in tandem with gains made from solution utility.

· $TSLA: At this stage, car sales are growing and we haven't hit an extended downturn in the cyclical environment. Just wait till the FSD, energy credits, insurance, ride hailing, and grid energy revenues print infinitely and indefinitely. Anticipate unrealized earnings & receivables to pace with earnings growth.

**-(9. Insiders are buying: $RKT & $TSLA check.**

· $RKT: Daddy Dan Gilbert & Juicy Jay Farner were loading up on shares < $20 in August

· $PLTR: Mithril (a Papa Thiel fund) got clearance to buy an s-ton of $PLTR at some point last week. Basically, a buy back, but we'll see more when the lock-up period ends.

· $TSLA: Denholym sold 43k shares at \~$400 per, but Emperor Elon is diamond handing his market cap option tranches which counts IMO.

**-(10. Its buying back shares: $RKT & $PLTR check.**

· $RKT: Announced a completed $1B buyback on the last earnings call

· $PLTR: Momma Wood (ARK) has been adding $1m+ in shares each week, but it basically just went public so too early for this.

· $TSLA: Issuing new funds to improve cash positions at elevated market cap.

Positions:

Buy the dip, LONG $RKT & $PLTR until $75b market cap, then readjust thesis. $TSLA to $1T market cap, then pivot into 2% divvie stocks till' I transcend into a Silver Fox incarnate.

They’ve had some hiccups in the last couple years, and they’ve obviously learned from them because they’re still around. They can’t get rid of the entire electrical grid of the west coast and they don’t dare break it up during a pandemic because of the cost of such a move. $PCG is going into the new year with no new major fires in 2021, new leadership and new found reliability based purely on my own experience. 

Now to boring shit.
Balance sheets are looking good post settlement and the company is more than able to recover 100% in short order. With that being said they are going to be the largest energy market in the US, so it’s about time we get while we can, the next few days should be WILD.

PLTR DD that a good friend of mine did,0.87,"DISCLAIMER: I’m not a douche who’s going to pretend I did any of this. I did nothing other than ask a friend who has experience with the company what he thought about them. He has a background and degree related to finance and a MASSIVE amount of knowledge on investing. He’s a an absolute GOD of DD. He had written this all the way back in OCTOBER. Without further intro, here’s a bunch of awesome DD. TL;DR: PLTR to the fucking 🌝 🚀🚀🚀🚀


*Profitability*

Price to sales is high, coming in at 15.63. Compared to some of their competitors (listed below), the average for the industry is below 2. Said differently, investors are paying a high premium for the rapid growth in revenue and the hope that the industry will explode someday. The key questions are will the AI industry expand and how much of this market will be funneled into Palantir, both commercially and from the government. 

Their revenue is growing quickly. Over the past year it has grown 21.27% and over the prior three years it has a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.83%.

Cash flow and net income are both negative, but they are improving. Their net income has increased by 20% over the past year and their free cash flow has increased by 64.41%. 

Net profit margins are also still negative, but increased 32.63% over the prior year. One thing about their margins is that they definitely live a lavish life style at their workplace. The food is free, the equipment is expensive, and the amenities are abundant—having observed this, they absolutely attract some of the best employees around. 

A nice segway into the balance sheet is to talk about their accounts receivable (A/R). Their ability to collect money consistently and accurately are impressive, with only $5 million in A/R for this year and only $2 million in A/R last year. 

*Balance Sheet*

The company has a book value of $791.47 million and sells at a P/B of ~21.10. This is high for a traditional value or growth play, but is not absurd for technology companies.

Their current and quick ratio are 2.78 and 2.65, respectively. This is impressive—for safety, a rule of thumb I use is a current ratio above 1.5 and a quick ratio above 1. Anything over 2 ensures a high probability of survival during difficult times. Also, the company barely has any money tied up in restricted cash, allowing them to allocate money to working capital more easily and preventing liquidity crises. But it is not as rosy as it seems. I will talk about the preferred securities shortly. 

The company has $1.08 billion in short-term cash and cash equivalents. Their short-term (> 1 year) liabilities are $730 million and their total liabilities are $3.57 billion. The D/E ratio is impressive, hovering around .39. The larger contractors usually have a D/E ratio above 1-1.5, with the exception of Raytheon. 

One thing that is not shown in the D/E ratio is something I mentioned in a prior paragraph, the preferred stock. This is a problem because preferred shares act very similar to debt. They currently have $2.13 billion in preferred shares outstanding, and I am not sure how many of those are convertible. If we add that to the debt, their new D/E ratio is over 2, putting it higher than most defense contractors. 

*Compensation / Dilution*

Currently, the company has $1.6 billion shares outstanding from their direct listing. On top of that, they have approximately 2.17 billion diluted shares. Said differently, if all options and convertible securities are activated, that is the potential number of shares outstanding. For any company this is an extreme amount of dilution and something Warren Buffet warns value investors about. The engineers and executives are highly compensated through their 250 million+ stock option program, as well as the preferred security holders. 

*Insider Selling*

One thing we never like to see is insider selling. The CEO has sold 11% of his stake, or 14.1 million shares, for $135 million. Cofounder Peter Thiel sold even more, ~$365 million. Nonetheless, the CEO still has the majority of his holdings and will be issued more stock if the company reaches goals in the future. This is something I am not too excited about, but it is not a major red flag because it was a small amount and perhaps he just wanted some cash—he has been working hard for 17 years awaiting this day. 

*Competitors*

When it comes to direct competitors (contractors that specialize in AI), it appears that Leidos, Raytheon, and FireEye stand out the most. However, looking at the defense contracting industry as a whole, Lockheed, Boeing, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman also present threats. Interestingly, there are arguments online that Palantir is extra risky because ~half of their revenue comes from US Government contracts, but this is a common characteristic for many of the defense contractors that I listed above, even Boeing. 

*Valuation*

I will base my valuation on them staying negative cash flow in the coming three years then netting X amount of cash flow for a few scenarios. I can send you the excel document if you want. I will summarize below. My discount rate is 8% (which is high, but conservative) and my growth rate is 7% (which is also somewhat optimistic). 

When it comes to cash flow, I have estimated they will stay negative for three years then slowly work up to $100 million. I will assign different values to their perpetual cash flow after 10 years below keeping the growth rate and discount rate the same. Two major things can happen to mess up the calculations. The growth rate could be higher or lower and the amount of cash flow could be higher or lower.  

Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $100 million annually: $10.9 billion
Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $150 million annually: $16.263 billion
Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $200 million annually: $21.613 billion
Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $250 million annually: $26.963 billion
Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $300 million annually: $32.213 billion
Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $350 million annually: $37.663 billion

It’s difficult to value a company that is in such an early stage based off cash flow. We have no idea how much cash flow they will bring in, how much the industry will grow, or where interest rates will be. Nonetheless, doing this analysis is sobering and dampens expectations. 

*Other Topics*

Their recruiting and the quality of engineers and computer scientists are similar to that of Tesla. People in the industry know this is a difficult company to work for. Their interviewing process is unique and difficult, usually encompassing a difficult task using their software (i.e. here is a bunch of data; find the terrorist using Gotham). 

Another interesting thing to look at is a top-down, or macro, approach to the industry. 

Here are some interesting points:
1. The US military budget is ~$689.6 billion, and this will likely increase or stay the same in the future
2. AI accounted for ~$4 billion of this budget
3. Cyber security accounted for ~$9.85 billion 
4. Palantir receives approximately half their revenue from government contracts, which is ~$500 million

Let’s assume that the combined budget for AI and cybersecurity grows to $20 billion ($5 billion higher than it is now) in the future, which I think is reasonable. If Palantir is one of the leaders in this industry and accumulate 5% of that $20 billion budget, that would be $1 billion from government contracts, not including their fast growth in the commercial industry. These numbers are conservative, as I think the allocation for AI and cyber could be closer to $50-$100 billion someday. This is where the opportunity is and the commercial side is just icing on the cake. 

If Palantir becomes the leader and the world trends more to cybersecurity and AI, there is potential to make money. 

Finally, I would like to speak about my personal experience with the company. I have used many intelligence tools, but only two stand out to me. Palantir is one of them and it is a cut above its peers. The beauty, capability, and analysis tools are unmatched. It is user-friendly but I wouldn’t say anyone on the street could stand up and use it. I am not sure their plans, but they could modify it and use it for so many applications in the business world. This is something I hope they do.

Why did PLTR sell off last week? (An analysis),0.9,"# Everybody that wanted in, was already in
According to finviz.com, retail investors own 79% of PLTR's float (shares available for trading), suggesting that much of the price increase from $10 to over $30 in the past 3 months was driven by said class of investors. It's unlikely that risk-sensitive institutions would be heavily involved in such a feverish stock. For example, Palantir's market cap increased by more than $10 billion in a couple days after the announcement of a $44 million 3-year partnership with the FDA. $44 million over 3 years is a rounding error relative to its annual revenue.
After hitting its $33 peak, PLTR pulled back and consolidated at a $25 to $29 price range. During this time, people continue to be bullish for the stock with many believing that it'll soon break all-time-highs again. Unfortunately, at least in the short term, everyone that wanted in was already in and the lack of new buying primed the stock for a sell-off. Another way to spot this is when /r/WallStreetBets starts being filled with bullish commentary for the stock. On a few days in November and December, the majority of the subreddit was talking about PLTR. If you think about it, users would only create a bullish post or upvote bullish posts of a stock if they already had a long position.
Once the buying pressure waned, a small amount of selling compounded with other bearish factors discussed below were sufficient to trigger large waves of selling.
# Options market makers selling hedged stocks for sold calls
Options market makers are institutions contracted by an exchange to supply liquidity to the options market, even when there's no willing external buyer or seller. Market makers make money by buying or selling options to traders at slightly worse prices than the actual price, and pocketing the difference. As such, they aren't interested in making a directional bet on a stock's price by being short or long options and whenever you sell or buy an option from them, they need to hedge their position.
Specifically, when a market maker sells a call option to a trader, the market maker needs to hedge by buying the underlying stock. When a market maker buys a call option from a trader, the market maker shorts the underlying stock. Vice versa for puts.
PLTR had a large number of open call positions expiring at year-end. As price fell, most of these options expired worthless and the market makers that sold them had to unwind their hedges. Because market makers buy the underlying stock to hedge against a sold call position, they sell said stock when unwinding the hedge. As large numbers of PLTR's call options expired worthless at year-end, options market makers sold the PLTR they bought as a hedge which contributed to the year-end price decline.
# Institutional funds rebalancing
Even though retail investors own most of Palantir's tradeable shares, institutions do own a non-trivial amount (12% of the float, according to finviz.com) that were mostly acquired during the IPO. These institutions include Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, and Soros Fund Management. Funds have a target ownership percentage for each portfolio stock and when its price increases or decreases dramatically in a short period, the fund needs to rebalance by selling or buying said stock. Rebalancing happens either at a fixed time period or when an imbalance threshold is crossed. Because PLTR's price appreciated so rapidly in just a couple months, it probably fell victim to year-end institutional rebalancing.
# Frontrunning profit-taking in 2021
Because PLTR's price increased so rapidly in 2020, traders are expected to sell in 2021 to defer taxes for one year. It's likely that some traders attempted to get ahead of this expectation by selling a few days before December 30th (trades executed on and after this date settle in 2021). PLTR's price started to fall off a cliff on December 28th and it kept falling until the year's last trading day on December 31st. As such, the selling on the 28th and 29th is partially attributed to traders frontrunning new-year-profit-taking while the selling on the 30th and 31st is new-year-profit-taking.
# Frontrunning the 2021 lock-up period expiry
Palantir's IPO was a direct listing meaning that it only made existing shares sellable on the market. No new shares were created and sold. This means that insiders (founders, employees, and VCs) own most of Palantir's shares. During the IPO, these insiders could only sell 20% of their holdings and the other 80% are locked up until after 2021's first earnings report. Unsurprisingly, traders expect more selling than usual when these shares unlock since 80% is a lot of shares. Long time PLTR holders will want to divest at least some of their holdings. It's plausible that, like new-year-profit-taking, traders are selling early to get ahead of the lock-up period ending.
# Price chart sell signals
Technical analysis (using price charts to determine when to buy or sell) is controversial but still popularly used to predict short term price movements. PLTR's chart displayed several sell signals ever since it peaked at $33. For one, the chart has a giant double top with rejections at $33 and $31 on November 27th and December 8th respectively. A double top is a very popular sell signal. Bullish momentum and volume has also waned since the price peak with daily MACD (a technical indicator) becoming bearish on December 10th. Falling momentum is no bueno for a stock driven by momentum.

Palantir (PLTR) is heavily exposed to oil and gas prices... what?,0.88,"Just watched a short clip on CNBC which was explaining why a bunch of IPO stocks were down in the final week of trading for 2020. Gina Sanchez stated Palantir was down due to heavy exposure to the oil and gas industry but that makes zero sense to me as I don't see how oil prices are even related to a big data company like Palantir.

**ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS MORE “ARTIFICAL” THAN “INTELLIGENT”**

As has been dutifully noted by many fellow autists, Palantir is an artificial intelligence/algorithim data mangement software company. However, you don’t quite have to worry about your wife going off and getting a robot boyfriend anytime soon. While this may come to a surprise to Jeffery Epstein’s pal Steve Hawking[who believed robots will soon take over the world](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newsweek.com/stephen-hawking-named-epstein-unsealed-files-virginia-giuffre-ghislaine-maxwell-1521920%3famp=1)  smart people in the field have been dealing with solving the problems of making artificial intelligence work for decades. This is good news for all those that have diamond hands 💎👐 on their Palantir shares in the coming years, because one of the founders solved one of the major problems over a decade ago and I’ll tell you how.


**The problem with Artificial Intelligence and the Palantir Solution**


If you aren’t yet familiar with [Stephen Cohen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Cohen_(entrepreneur)) you should be. This is the ultimate autist chad that coded the first prototype of Palantir in 8 weeks. At his time at Stanford, he studied machine learning and artifical intelligence (this was way back in 2005, these beasts of nature are always 20~ years ahead of the normie media and their trends). However, as Cohen himself mentions in his talk at Stanford [“The Path to Palantir”](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g_6_kGDdjwI) he became dissapointed studying AI due to the many limitations of the field he quickly realized. Firstly, the AI is only ever as smart as the algorithms that the humans were able to develop, thus more “artificial” than “intelligent.” Secondly, while computers are able to store and calculate numbers even faster than an autist doing his math homework before his mom will let him have his tendies, and their superior skill at storing this information, computers cannot grasp numerous concepts that human’s are skilled at. Most fundamentally, this is creativity and anything that is subjective. The example Cohen uses in his speech is hunger. Try explaining the feeling of hunger to someone and while you may be able to quantify it as a number between 1-10, this quantification leaves a lot out that someone that has never experienced hunger would not begin to understand. To put it simply, there are numerous factors in life that are impossible for a computer to quantify. Computers are good at factors they can quantify (numbers) but are as retarded as your average WSB bottom feeder when it comes to the qualitative (subjective). This is where Palantir comes in. Effectively, Palantir solves the quantitative issues for the human and lays it out for humans to interact with and add in qualitative analysis. Palantir is a marriage between a computer’s impeccable ability to process and store numbers and data and humans impeccable ability to use creativity and view context as well as the subjective. 


**Software & Business: The Dinosaur Superstructure**


Heres where our other founder bellwether [Peter Thiel ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel) comes in. If you haven’t heard of him yet, your girlfriend probably doesn’t you stay out past 8 PM, even when she’s not home. Member of the paypal mafia, when hes not busy making billions with his buddies musk and bezos, he’s [taking down Gawker with Hulk Hogan ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/06/21/peter-thiels-war-on-gawker-a-timeline/?sh=78387f3251c5)for outing his private sex life. Like how Cohenknows how computer’s work, Thiel knows how businesses work. How many people here have been in an actual office building? Probably not the right crowd, I know, most of you still live in your parent’s basement, but that won’t matter when PLTR moons. Anyway, one of the first things youll notice is that the majority of technology used by businesses and governments are older than the average /r/teenagers poster. [According to research conducted by Kaspersky, “four in ten of very small businesses (VSB), and roughly half of small and medium-sized businesses (SMB), still rely on operating systems such as Windows XP or Windows 7 which are nearing their end of life.”](https://www.itproportal.com/amp/news/businesses-still-dependent-on-outdated-software/) For some reason, I cannot find similar statistics for even larger companies that would be more likely for Palantir to be working with, but i’d wager from experience and knowing the scaleability issues that come with updating to technology, especially when dealing with a bunch of boomers, that it would be even higher for large companies. However, this is great news, because our good friend Thiel has the perfect formula to grab the biggest 6000 businesses by the balls.


Essentially, Palantir fronts the costs of installing and getting the software embedded into an operation in it’s “acquisition contract” stage. Im not a finance frog, but from what I understand they don’t actually make money from these contracts. Hence why they haven’t been profitable. However, the model is like a snowball. After the acquisition contract has expired, the boomers running the operation Palantir is contracting to have finally figured out how to use the software without training wheels and it is entrenched in their companies business. A larger contract with higher margins is signed. [Further, companies of that companies competition look at what Palantir has done for that company, such as when in Q3 Palantir found 315m in unnecessary spending for an oil and gas company, slotting to save the company 1b in the coming 12 months](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx) and they are forced to sign an acquisition contract, further pushing the snowball along and acting as a case study of success for Palantir. 


Remember to diamond hands and buy that dip. The markets are an unmedicated bipolar teenaged girl on her period and currently Palantir is in a downswing, but that is only a buying opportunity for the wise of us. Short term, I could see Palantir dipping as low as $20. This negative feedback loop will be broken either by a new contract, Karp interview day, another media announcement, or demo day. Eventually. I’ll lose a lot of you here, if I already havent, but hold strong and don’t stress the short term as long as you agree with my thesis and have done/seen enough due diligence of your own to understand the fundamentals of this company are as solid as Karp’s skiing legs. Longer term, I can see this company being at 100b+ market cap being conservative.

Palantir 3 Month Bull Flag (2DAMOON) PLTR to 35$ by Marcg,0.63,,2021-01-02 02:55:22
I think WSB is sleeping on a huge opportunity in Apple this month. Here’s why.,0.96,"**TLDR:** Due to a confluence of factors (none of which are technical analysis), I believe a perfect storm is likely forming for a monster, historic ER occurring sometime in late January. The initial main factor for this was that COVID issues were causing a delay in the iPhone 12 launch, pushing it into to this quarter, but that led me to discover numerous other factors now making up my thesis. I believe not only will earnings grow, but the multiple could even expand. How to play it: calls dated end of Jan or mid Feb.    
    
# Analysis:    
Happy hangover day, fellow autists. I believe opportunities are rare to know when an ER is going to blow it out of the water by enough to overcome IV crush based on more than just a hunch, and when they occur once or twice per year you should swing big. When I play earnings releases, I’m almost always just a seller of spreads so that I can profit off of theta/IV crush surrounding the ER (theta gang always wins). This time however, I’ve bought outright calls. Here is what I’m seeing with Apple: 
    
## The iPhone 12 delay could mean huge YoY comparisons.    
What kicked all this off was that two months ago I realized we could be heading for huge numbers this quarter due to an atypical delay in the launch of the newest iPhone. Typically new iPhones are announced in mid-September with preorders beginning immediately and shipments beginning before the end of the month. However this year because of COIVD delays the launch date got pushed into October. The iPhone 12 preorders began mid-October with shipments a week later, and the iPhone 12 mini and Max began preorders November 6. And that means no sales of the new models counted in the quarter ended Sept. 30 (Apple’s fiscal fourth quarter)as they usually do. This year all of those opening day sales have fallen into the upcoming fiscal Q1, setting up a potentially huge quarter in sales and making for easy YoY comparisons right out of the gate.  [Here’s a Fortune article on the delay of the launch.](https://fortune.com/2020/10/29/apple-q4-2020-earnings-delayed-iphone-12-sales/)    
    
## The “super cycle” rumors appear to be true.    
As a lover of new tech, I always have to remind myself that the average person doesn’t care about incremental new features as much as I do. So when I heard rumors earlier this year that Apple could be facing a “super cycle” of upgrades due to 5G, I was skeptical. How much does the average person really care about spotty 5G service enough to jump on a new iPhone? But based on reports starting to come out, those rumors appear to be correct. I’ve seen a few articles suggesting a super cycle not seen since the iPhone 6.     
    
[Here’s a Yahoo Finance article on Wedbush’s analysis](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wedbush-apple-aapl-iphone-12-141113883.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACvsQ8XuWl-EktMyc_0BOQkervx-N2812THmBzr26X8EZIBpNv2lmQ5FSlcToQD1EVRPC0q6byIRBL57FjX5kL4yCvJbv0rwaj4D16cz9J0QrnLFX9fVib7fRoDktDyMAWwBKhfTL_JRqy04wsJCzfTUD7Aw9ce6SkM21ZQOqbYO).   
    
Here are some notable quotes from that article since I know we don’t read around here.    
>""Based on our recent Asia checks we believe the supply chain is anticipating low to mid 90 million iPhone unit builds … **a roughly 35% increase from our original and Street forecasts**,"" says Ives, who covers AAPL stock for Wedbush.    
    
>Compare that to the firm's expectations for iPhone 12 unit sales over time. Three months ago, Wedbush expected 65 million to 70 million unit builds for the December quarter; it raised its outlook to 75 million units in late October; and in mid-December, it set a ""stretch goal"" in the mid-80 million range.    
    
>Wall Street broadly sees AAPL selling 217 million iPhones in the company's fiscal 2021, but Wedbush's bull case is ""north of 240 million units (250 million could be in the cards – an eye popping figure)"" that would easily surpass the 231 million units the company sold in its fiscal 2015.    
    
>**""We have not seen a launch uptrend such as this in a number of years for Apple and the only iPhone trajectory similar would be the iPhone 6 in 2014 based on our analysis.""**.   
    
[Here is an AppleInsider article, although it quotes the same research at Wedbush](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/15/apple-iphone-production-reports-corroborate-supercycle-thesis-analyst-says).   
Notable quote:    
> That bump in production would represent a 30% year-over-year increase in smartphone models produced, **and is also well ahead of current Wall Street expectations**, Ives wrote.    
    
    
It’s anecdotal, but I personally skipped the iPhone 11 upgrade because I was perfectly content with my XS Max, however I did buy the 12 Pro Max.    
    
## The iPhone 12 sales mix:   
It’s not just that phone sales will be up on the iphone 12 launch, it’s the mix within those sales. Typically when Apple launches phones they sell more of the of the entry level new phones than they do the premium, because the total addressable market is bigger. That doesn’t appear to be the case this time. As early as September people were reporting that [Apple was making more higher end iPhone 12 models than entry-level handsets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-gets-price-target-hike-iphone-12-sales-mix) anticipating a shift in demand, and they appear to have been correct. Last year the entry level iPhone 11s outsold the premium iPhone 11s by a three to one margin. This year almost immediately after launch [people were reporting that the premium iPhone 12s were selling as much as the entry models.](https://investorplace.com/2020/10/greater-than-expected-iphone-12-demand-apple-aapl-stock-buy/) Since then, there have been reports trickling out that the premium iPhone 12s appear to actually be outselling the entry level versions.   
    
## Apple sold out of nearly everything they make for Christmas.
See further below for one of the reasons this may have happened, in both my “macro” and “risks” sections.    
    
    

Apple introduced a slough of new products from iMacs to watches this year, and they sold out of all of them. **The list of sold-out products at Christmas included the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max; iPad, iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad Mini; MacBook Air and Pro; iMac and iMac Pro; HomePod mini, and AirPods Max.** [Here’s a Barron’s article mentioning the sell outs](https://www.barrons.com/articles/barrons-10-best-stocks-for-2021-51608337138).    

    
    
Apple wearables, I would argue, are now what economists call Veblen goods. These are unique products where the demand curve actually increases as the price increases. This can happen in goods such as wine, where the consumer lacks the knowledge in how to evaluate the product so they take pricing as a signal of quality. But another reason you can get that skewed demand curve is if the product conveys status. One example of this is sports cars. You can buy cars with 90% of the performance of the ultra top end cars for 30% of the price, but that’s not the point of owning them, is it? How often are you really out at the track? Lambo isn’t in competition with $50k sports cars. They could raise the price $50k per car and people who can afford them would just want them more. Louis Vuitton bags and $50,000 Birkin purses are more examples. In fact with Birkin they not only constantly raise prices, they forbid people from buying them. You have to spend a lot of money on other lower tier products before you’re “allowed” to even buy a Birkin bag. This just makes new money women want them even more. 
   

Those are dramatic examples of course and Apple isn’t behaving that way, but Apple just introduced very overpriced, new over-the-ear headphones which cost almost twice as much as the leading competitor, and yet...Apple sold out of every single color in the first two weeks and hit a three month waiting list by Christmas on a product that I would assume due to its high pricing has very fat margins. Apple charging twice as much makes them more appealing, not less, because wearables are worn and thus seen by your peers (and the opposite sex).   
    
## The Twitter rumor mill is reporting parts moving at a brisk pace
I can’t track down the things I’ve read here and there on Twitter and I’m starting to run out of steam here, so you may have to do some searching on your own, but people who usually track movement of parts through the companies forming Apple’s supply chain and normally have a good track record with their reports have reported that parts are moving through the chain at a very brisk pace. This is addressed some in the reports on the iPhone supply chain in my earlier links.    
    
## App sales are crushing it.   
Thanks probably in part to quarantine, app sales have been crushing it and [grew ~35% this December compared to ~17%](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-alphabet-strong-christmas-sales) the prior year, meaning sales have grown at twice the pace.     

## Reoccurring revenue bundle numbers will be announced     
The biggest thing I’ve learned from 2020 is that nothing matters more to the market than the narrative surrounding the reoccurring revenue bundle...aka subscriptions. A company announces its cutting its dividend, but then tells you that’s because its going to pour all that money into boosting its subscriptions? The stock skyrockets. Look at Disney. ATT may be able to pull this off as well if it can convince people of that narrative with Warner/HBO max and cut its dividend to pour it into content, but that’s a big “if” for them.    
    
Apple launched their new reoccurring revenue bundle this year. I personally signed up for the premium tier and now owe Apple $30 per month for the rest of my life. I was already paying them to backup my phone to the cloud, and now their bundle has thrown me into Apple Music, Apple TV+, etc. I am firmly entrenched in the Apple universe whether I like it or not.     
    
It is these reoccurring revenue numbers that offer the possibility of earnings multiple expansion.
    
# RISKS
**Are sellouts due to high demand, or due to COVID-related production problems?**    
I don’t know.  Based on the reports I’ve read, some of which have been linked earlier in my post, it sounds like everything is running full speed in China and the supply chain is running at near or above a record clip. One possible risk is that this was not the case earlier this year and thus Apple sold out of things because they hadn’t produced enough heading into Christmas. I personally believe that production may have taken a huge hit early in the calendar year, but by mid to late 2020 this was no longer a significant issue. I also believe that even if sales have taken a slight hit due to production, the market wouldn’t really care. Markets are forward looking. They know COVID has impacted things globally, and even if Apple reports sales difficulties **they will be paired with significantly increased guidance for Q2**. [New reports have suggested that Apple has had to increase its iPhone production plans for 2021 by 20-30% because of strong demand](https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/15/strong-iphone-12-demand/) An announcement like that is not a recipe for a stock crash.     
    
    

**Macro factors causing a crash**.    
A lot of people around here appear to be scared of an impending crash. This seems to be based on the simple idea that stocks have run up a lot and therefore must crash. A reversion to the mean is imminent. I don’t see it that way and I think the economy is more complex than that. Just because something has gone up a lot does not mean it’s going to crash. People have been warning of a California real estate crash for 70 years.    
    

I’m a little bit older than you guys (by probably about 10-15 years) and I can remember the market frenzy of the dot.com boom. A lot of people were saying the same thing then, and while they were ultimately proven right, they were very early. I remember seeing another year to year and a half of enormous gains after hearing all those warnings. Of course the problem with musical chairs is that we never know when the music will stop, but I would argue if anything stocks are roughly fairly valued, not dangerously overvalued.    
    
As we go into 2021, we face the following conditions: a vaccine roll out that sometime between now and late ‘21 will lead us into a v-shaped recovery. [The Krugman argument for this vision](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/opinion/joe-biden-economy.html), and [The Bloomberg argument for this vision](https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/opinion/articles/2020-12-01/get-ready-for-a-supercharged-economy). We also just had the Fed reaffirm 0% interest rates and the continuation of QE. Add to all of that very easy YoY earnings comps for the first two quarters of this year and this is not a recipe for a crash, it’s a recipe for a steady market melt up. Where are the rich supposed to put all their money in a 0% interest rate environment? 0% pushes up the value of all asset classes, and this is especially true of real estate and stonks. Generally speaking, predicting macro economic movements is a losing game, but all of those things combined with the easy YoY comps means I don’t feel the need to be concerned of an impending correction for at least the next two quarters. 
    
A much smaller factor but still a factor, I have seen it suggested that Apple will be among the larger beneficiaries of the stimulus checks going out, although those have not started rolling out until just now so that may have an impact on Q2 if any.

**Bad subscription numbers**    

If subscriptions to Apple One flopped, this could significantly overshadow sales and earnings numbers. I personally feel Apple isn’t likely to seriously miscalculate predictions on a subscription bundle because they have their market dialed in, but I don’t know that for sure. 

**Sales could have cratered in October**    

Sales often drop a little in the weeks preceding a phone launch. What if phone sales tanked during the delays waiting for an iPhone 12? That could be bad. I’m encouraged by the fact that iPhone 11 models appeared to still be having good sales numbers when the iPhone 12 was launched (see links earlier in this post), but I don’t really know what October sales look like.

**COVID could have tanked all phone sales.**    

[This report says all phone activations generally tanked 23% on Christmas Day.](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-iphones-dominate-christmas-day-activations) Two thoughts I have on that, that number is for all phone activations, not just iPhones. And two, that’s just for Christmas Day itself. There could be a wide array of reasons activations were down on that one day. To counter that, [this report says the iPhone was the best selling 5G phone](https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/21/best-selling-5g-phone/), even in October despite the phone not launching until the second half of that month. Additionally that article mentions pent up demand for 5G apple phones that sales are likely to be strong going forward.

##  Technical Analysis   
I don’t believe in technical analysis. Charts don’t know any of the things I just explained, and are therefore, in my opinion, useless to me. Maybe somebody has figured out a system for charts to predict the future, but I am not that person.      
     
## Price Target    
I don’t pretend to know things like that.     
    


## Fun rumors    
I’m not big on speculative rumors and momentum type plays, but if that’s your thing there are certainly rumors in the air. The most famous of which is the rumor that Apple is back to working seriously on an EV Car. Another is reports are just coming out in the last day or two that [Apple is seeing new successes in developing foldable tech.](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/31/two-foldable-iphones-reportedly-pass-tests/) Whether these things will impact the stock price isn’t really my cup of tea, but if it’s yours those are two things to consider. 

## Is my post an attempt at a WSB pump and dump?    
I’m under no allusions that my own WSB post is going to alter the trajectory of a $2.25 trillion company in any meaningful way.  That sort of thing may work on a post-IPO company that hasn’t had its lockup expiration yet and thus has a tiny float (aka PLTR or numerous other recent “to the moon” meme stocks) with limited float. (That’s not to say those aren’t great companies or great trades. I’m just sayin’).


## My positions: 
I’m more conservative than most of WSB.  While I love this place with all my heart and love you guys for it, I believe risking it all to chase screenshot-worthy gains is moronic and not the path to building real, long-term wealth. Thus my positions are probably more conservative than you’d expect.    
    
I have 20% of my net worth tied up in Apple via LEAPs. 9/16/2022 AAPL $87.50 calls. I consider this to be essentially stock I hold for the long term. Delta is approaching 1 anyway so they practically are stock. Sometime in the depths of March I loaded up on FAANG LEAPs with the intention of actually holding them for years and then converting to shares. Those LEAPs were a little OTM at the time I bought them. I have no interest in day trading my significant LEAP positions so that’s going to sit there for the next two years.

But I also have put an additional 15% of my net worth into short term calls on Apple to play the ER. I have Feb 19 $130 calls which were about 10-15% OTM at the time I bought them. They are currently ITM. I also have 1/29 $135s and 1/29 $141s.     
    
This puts 35% of my net worth into Apple.

## How to get rich
I intend to cash out my short term calls after the ER, and I don’t intend to reinvest or roll them out because I suspect Apple will be fully valued by then and there are better plays out there. I intend to keep my LEAPS because I bought those for the very long term and because at the very least I should hold them until March to hit the long term capital gains tax rate.    
    
I intend to take my profits from the calls and push them into shorting NNOX and XPEV, both of which have significant lockup expirations coming in mid to late February which I believe will significantly impact the stock prices in the short term. I have no interest in shorting XPEV right now, because you guys are crazy as fuck and for all I know EV stonks could all run up another 50% in the next month. Right about the time the Apple ER hits should be perfect.

## Criticism    
If you think I’m wrong, I would strongly encourage you to comment. I don’t give a fuck about looking correct or saving face but I give many fucks about not losing money. If I’m wrong, I want to know it. 

## The Most Important Factor

Potential in coming real estate dip in 2021. Are there any non-idiots among us that work in this space and want to share their thoughts?,0.9,"TLDR: I have no fucking clue what I am talking about. It looks like the housing market is ready to decline in late 2021, maybe as soon as the spring. I am considering selling my rental house soon... obviously so I can yolo more into GME, PLTR, and SPCE - I can't help myself and I don't want help. If this happens, REITs might dip further, making for a nice entry point.

&#x200B;

Home prices have been steadily rising the last five or so years to the point  we are seeing a spike in the inflation adjusted housing costs. It looks  like we are at the 07/08 highs again.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r6on75066t861.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bac32713ff598bab5431b52ae7d8e45332340ba

I have been following the forbearance rates since covid started, and it looks like many of the national lenders have forbearance rates in the 3-6% range, still.  Historically these are under 1% for all lenders. If these eventually  turn into delinquencies after the forbearance period expires and covid  eviction protections expire, I am worried we might see a surge in  foreclosures and thus a flood of cheap real estate hitting the market, thus drastically reducing home prices in the second half of 2021.

I'll  walk you through the timing I am seeing. 

* The majority of forbearance  requests were made in March - June (the MBA has been publishing this  data). 
* These periods usually last 180 days,  based on historical forbearance periods. 
* And I believe these periods can  be extended for up to one year, which is also part of covid relief.
* The  national average number of delinquent payments on a mortgage before  foreclosure is about four.
* For those with 180 day forbearance periods started in March- June of 2020, it looks like this: 6 months forbearance + 4 months delinquency = 10 months, which puts these foreclosures on the market in February 2021-May 2021.
* For those with 365 day forbearance periods started in March- June of 2020, it looks like this: 12 months forbearance + 4 months delinquency = 16 months, which puts these foreclosures on the market in July 2021- October 2021.
* Finally, for those who were delinquent prior to covid, and would have been evicted during covid, the eviction protection has prevented banks from foreclosing, so these homes will hit the market in February 2021, after the eviction protections expire on January 31st 2021. Foreclosures are down 80% this year because of this.

&#x200B;

If  we check FRED and look at delinquent payment on real estate over the  last 20 years, we can see about 10% of homes and real estate were in delinquency by 2010 (below). If all the current forbearances turn into  delinquent payments, which turn into foreclosures, we could see a 2-6%  spike by the end of the summer, or a 2-6x increase in foreclosure  based real estate hitting the market. Plus we need to add in the 80% of foreclosures that will hit post eviction moratorium. That would be about 2/3s the delinquency rate we saw post financial crisis, which would could cause quite a dip in home prices.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5rr035o96t861.png?width=1173&format=png&auto=webp&s=6755ae28f0d241fba65b886498bf1372869637ff

The current market is also further magnified buy the shortage of homes for sale, in part due to the lack of foreclosures due to the eviction moratorium. You can see below, the US is at an all time low for monthly supply  of houses, dating back to 1960.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4136uv3c6t861.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=859c31a721b63b5c01f787d6cfec5ae387a8700e

When you combine a low supply with a relatively high demand (see housing  sales the last two years, below), this creates a pretty expensive market based  on supply and demand. Also, interest rates are low, so people can afford more, so housing prices are higher as a result.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/abfzz0he6t861.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd698a8aefca84c6318c3c74da02ec2293b7aa19

In agreement with this, home prices are the highest in history as well  (below), even when adjusted for inflation (first figure of the post).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This could easily turn  into a serious situation in which a sudden spike in foreclosures and  cheap real estate could cascade into a pretty swift crash, and  significantly reduce the value of real estate around the country by a  huge margin.

Does  anyone here have any real expertise on this matter? I am a complete  newb and idiot. I don't know what I am doing, I am just speculating. I  would greatly appreciate an expert's opinion on the matter.

Wait a second... If Palantir is the first software to find a link between otherwise non connected variants of data. Then this means it is one of the first forms of creativity coming from AI.,0.73,"
I’ve been doing quite a bit of research on Palantir. There’s a few objectives for my research. 
1: To actually understand what it is.

2: To assess the long term growth potential.

3: To assess possible competition and how that could thwart market domination

Through all of this I became very excited initially. 

As this seems to be a free thinking pathway that can intermediate between pseudo “subconscious” types of data relationships that would be unexplored by 99% of other data platforms.

Then I became quite terrified, really. 
This data is being used by central governments for the most part and huge corporations.

This is the medium between the value of data and the implications of everything that could be done with the amounts of data with no stone left unturned.

Not all of it will be good, that can be assured.

https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/about

From Covid tracking to ICE deportations. Palantir has data on otherwise low data groups with not much of a digital footprint.

The thing is that people like you and I, who have a massive data footprint will be most susceptible to the ways it uses data over the next few decades.

"1 Year, 100% ROI Challenge! January Thread + First Trade.",0.92,"**Update (1/8/21):**

I took a very big risk trading QS, and have been getting hammered hard by it recently. However, things are not as bad as they appear, when you consider the insane amount of premium I am collecting...

My true cost basis is $65 - $5.50 premium = $59.5 / share. After selling a single weekly covered call, that cost basis will drop to around $54 / share. Each additional weekly CC will continue to drop the cost basis over time. Which means **even with the stock I own being down 20% from my entry, I would still end up with a profit.** That is the power of selling extremely high IV options.

Only if QS tanks well below $50, and stays there for months on end, do I risk an actual loss on this trade. I just hope that doesn't happen...

**Update (1/17/21):**

Well, I really picked a dogshit stock, and now I'm stuck bagholding 100 shares of it...

QS has tanked hard consistently and is now down a whopping 21% from my entry point. Still, I'm going to follow my general rule and not close this position for a loss. I need to find the breakeven covered call. Which means: the intersection point where premium gained from the CC reduces my cost basis to match the strike price of the same CC. At the moment that appears to be almost exactly ATM.

**Option: QS 54c 1/29 = $5.50 premium**

**Cost basis: $65 (assignment) - $5.50 (CSP premium) - $5.50 (CC premium) = $54**

Again, this is the power of Theta Gang on high IV stocks, and why it will always outperform ""buy and hold."" Even with the stock being down 20%, I can still break even at the current price, and all I will have lost is time. Anyone who simply bought shares at the same exact time I entered my CSP would now be down 20% with little hope of recovery. I will of course have to reevaluate the prices Tuesday morning.

**LESSON LEARNED:** Don't be greedy. I was too enticed by the extremely high premium on QS. If I would have continued the more conservative PLTR play from last week, I'd be sitting pretty right now. Hopefully I can still recover and get this challenge back on track next week.

Positions and ROI to be updated Tuesday morning.

**Update (1/20/21):**

Another horrible -7% day for the QS shares we are bagholding. This stone looks like it will never stop dropping. I need to earn premium more quickly to reduce this cost basis as fast as possible. I went with a 30DTE option for $630 to drop my cost basis down to $51.50 per share. Luckily the IV is still sky high, making these significant cost basis reductions possible. However, if this continues tanking through the end of the month, we may just be done for...

=========================================

**Current Positions: 100 QS @ $65.00 (true cost basis: 65 - 5.5 - 1.7 - 6.3 = $51.50)**

**-1 QS 52c 2/5 @ 6.30**

**-1 PLTR 24.5p 1/29 @ 0.80**

# Introduction

**Happy New Year!** **TL;DR- I am going to double a small account over a year, and you are going to watch.**

Three months ago I wrote up a guide on consistently outperforming the S&P500 using Theta Gang strategy. That guide got a lot of positive feedback, and I suggest those who missed it take a look. [How to CONSISTENTLY Outperform the S&P500 using Theta Gang Strategy. A Comprehensive Guide to Wheeling ETFs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how_to_consistently_outperform_the_sp500_using/) And if you are truly retarded check out my recent Tips for Noobies. [Top 5 Tips Every Noobie Trader MUST Know.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4ztif/top_5_tips_every_noobie_trader_must_know/)

I've since decided to put my skills to the test and will attempt to double a small $8000 account by the end of 2021 using similar strategies. This will mostly be an educational experience, and I will walk you through all my thought processes and my trades as I make them so hopefully the retards among you can learn a thing or two. And if I blow up the account, that will be entertaining as well, right?

Some of the less experienced among you may think this is a simple feat. The more experienced among you will know achieving such consistently high returns will be an incredibly difficult feat. I put my odds of success somewhere around 20% to be honest. But it will be a good education for both of us. Really, I only need to achieve around 6% return every month to break 100% by the end of the year (after compounding), and put in those terms the task doesn't sound so daunting, does it?

Still, I will be forced to make some very aggressive, downright risky plays in order to make this remotely possible. If my wheeling ETF guide was about a safe, conservative strategy, this guide will be the opposite. Keep that in mind if you are foolish enough to copy my trades.

Wish me luck... I will need it.

# Basic Strategy

I will not leave any tool off the table here. If I see an opportunity, I will take it. But for the majority of my trades I will be using a very simple strategy. Find high implied volatility stonks and sell options on them. I will typically be selling cash-secured puts since naked calls carry excess risk, which means I want to look for stocks I am generally bullish on long-term.

Using ToS I've set up some very basic filters to scan for promising stocks to trade:

**1) Option Implied Volatility >80% (for tendies)**

**2) Stock Volume >5,000,000 (for liquidity)**

**3) Market Cap >$1B (to comply with WSB rules)**

**4) Stock Price <$82 (collateral maximum)**

Scanning with these filters brings up a lot of familiar names: GME, PLTR, QS, NKLA, LAZR, FCEL, UVXY, ACB, XPEV, SPCE, and so on. In other words, the type of stonks retards like you are buying expensive options on...

# Running the Numbers

I will try to not get too technical and into the weeds with this experiment. I'll be using some very basic math to decide which options to sell. I highly recommend you play around with the numbers on options to really get an intuitive feel for how they work. For example, if I were to ask you what happens to the relative cost of premium ($/day) as DTE increases on an option, what would be your answer? If you don't know, just run some simple numbers to find out...

SPY premium / DTE = $/day

332 / 5 = 66.4

440 / 10 = 44

652 / 21 = 31

1915 / 140 = 13.7

As you can see, premium cost per day decreases as time till expiration increases. (It's more complicated than that of course, but we are keeping it simple here). For that reason I will be doing something I generally don't advocate: Selling weeklies to squeeze a bit of extra juice out of my options. This also means I will be holding them all to expiration to deal with issues like higher gamma.

Here is another simple equation I can use to give me a lot of information:

**(Premium \* 365) / (DTE \* Strike) = Max ROI**

Basically what I'm doing is estimating the returns from selling the same option for an entire year with a 100% success rate. Since I'm aiming for 100% ROI, any options I sell will need to be over 100 in this formula. Of course, I won't have a 100% success rate on my trades, so I should probably aim even higher to give myself some buffer, maybe around 120. Let's try it on some \~ATM options to get a relative comparison of option value:

SPY: 12.2

PSTH: 48.1

GME: 140.5

PLTR: 111.1

QS: 263.7

UVXY: 134.2

Don't put too much stock in these numbers. I'm just using them as a simple comparative tool for judging the profitability of different options.

We can glean even more information from the above number if we multiply it by the Prob. ITM% of course, to get something closer to an ""Expected Value"" for an option, which I will perhaps go into more detail on next month.

Finally I'll be throwing around various other calculations as I go, $/day, ROI/month, premium/collateral, and so on. I will need to watch all of these and more to reach my goal.

# My First Trade

Looking at the stocks in my filter, there are two that really stand out to me: GME and PLTR. That's right, everyones favorite meme stocks!

GameStop is interesting as a short-term play, and has very high IV. But I'm not confident in the company as a long-term play, and would hate to be assigned hundreds of shares of that shitty brick and mortar hellscape. Palantir, on the other hand, has serious growth potential long-term and I would not mind being assigned. It has also been hit hard recently and is at a more reasonable entry level, which also makes it a good choice. **Therefore, I will be trading PLTR as my first play.**

I want to sell an OTM put to give myself some downside protection against a further drop, but not so far OTM that I can't break my 100% ROI goal. Let's plug some of the Jan. 15 options into my formula above to get a breakdown of the potential ROI.

21 strike: 74.2

22 strike: 108.4

22.5 strike: 131.9

23 strike: 155.5

Either the 22 or 22.5 strikes are right near the sweet spot we are looking for in terms of return. Of course conditions will likely change on Monday and I may need to reassess, but at the moment my current play seems to be:

**Sell to Open 3 contracts of PLTR 22p 1/15.**

If Monday opens red it will be even better for us, since we get in at a cheaper price with likely higher IV on top. So I for one am praying for a bloody Monday for Palantir (sorry bagholders).

Of course after selling 3 contracts at 22 strike, we will only have used $6600 of our $8000 capital. I may need to look for one more smallish trade on a stock in the $14 range to take full advantage of our capital. If GME drops on Monday we could consider a far OTM play there, for instance.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR- I am going to double a small account, and you are going to watch.**

Why you need to take mortgage forbearance ASAP,0.73,"If you currently have a federally backed mortgage you will be absolutely fucking retarded if you don't take mortgage forbearance!

due to the cares act pasting earlier in 2020 you are able to take forbearance and not have to pay back the missed payments until the end of your loan. 

Think about it, you basically get an interest free loan for 30 God damn years.

Example: My mortgage is $1300 now even if you were a boring ass boomer excited about your 7% annual returns after 30 years you would accumulate $118,751 after the 30 years.

Now if you want to showcase how massive your giant bull balls are you can put that money in PLTR, GME, or TSLA and see real fucking gains.

Edit: I think it's funny that a lot of the dislikes comes from people thinking this is some scumbag leach off the system shit meanwhile there are billionaires who gained billions through this pandemic, corporations taking PPE loans that don't need them, people finding creative tax loopholes all the time.

Selling Leaps - Vega Plays,0.82,"For those who don't know their Greeks yet, go read the Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks\_(finance)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_(finance))) and then donate $2.75 of your 2020 gains to them so you get the tax write-off. Probably will cross post this with r/thetagang this weekend, but they tend to get uppity about Vega plays.

2020 had historically high volatility, but we have already started to see that volatility steadily drop over the course of the year. My thesis is this will continue to drop significantly throughout Q1/Q2 of next year and then level off once ""normal"" business operations resume sometime in the 2nd half of 2021.

Most people are familiar with Theta plays involving selling an option and running out the clock. In a nutshell, Vega measures how the value of an option will respond to changes in volatility (IV). If you are buying piles of PSTH, GME, PLTR, shares (etc.), you might consider selling a covered call far into the future with intentions of buying it back in 3-6 months. Yes, the stocks are going to go up eventually, but probably not as fast as Theta and Vega will drag them down over the next several months. Also, you should time selling it for a spike and buying back a few months later on a dip.

I have been doing this with mostly SPACs with mid-dated calls (3-6 months out), but also a handful of stocks like PLTR, DISCA, and some small caps I can't name for Leaps. My costs basis on the shares have been pushed down significantly and now all of my SPACs shares are significantly below NAV (below $20 for PSTH and below $10 for the others). I haven't always timed things perfectly, but overall this has been an effective strategy the past 3 months.

**Edit:  wouldn't recommend doing this with small/microcaps if volume for leaps is low.**

***Alternatively***, poor man's covered calls (PMCC) are quite viable, but be careful doing that on Robinhood because if your short leg gets called they will automatically call your long leg to cover it and you'll lose a bit of money. This runs counter to my thesis in the mid-run but for many stocks in the long run it's a good play as well.",2020-12-31 23:57:53

You see, unlike over here in the west, the Chinese people don't treat 2021 as some new number they slap on a calendar, oh no. 2021 also represents a new animal on their zodiac calendar. And what animal is 2021? The year of the FUCKING BULL. That's right boys, the bull market is confirmed!

🌌👽Why I'm Bullish on Palantir - Oxford Phd Student Analysis👽🌌,0.87,"So I don't know too much about investing, apart from reading the financial times each day. However as a computer science doctoral student at Oxford, specialising in security and data analytics, I have invested 2000 pounds into Palantir stock. I am excessively bullish about long term prospects for this stock, for the following reasons:

[Dr. Moonshot Sparkles authorising the trade.](https://preview.redd.it/n6xh3rtsyj861.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c4b9ae91f4e45b52e04938e358fe17324d27cc5a)

\-Palantir were offering undergraduate and masters students here up to 100,000 pounds to act as forward deployed engineers (in 2016).

\-Palantir's recruitment process is known to be equivalent to or even tougher than Google's, 1 of my friends failed Palantir's assessments but now works as a site reliability engineer at Google  

\-My investment adviser, Dr. Moonshot Sparkles, pictured wearing a Palantir hat, given as part of campus recruitment efforts is excessively bullish on PLTR.

'Palantir\] is the best tool I have ever worked with. It’s intuitive, i.e. idiot-proof, and can do a lot you never even dreamt of doing.

This morning, using TWO FACE rather than XKS to review the activity of the last 3 days. It reduced the initial analysis time by at least 50%.'

and

'While it’s long been known that Palantir got on its feet with the intelligence community’s money, it has not been previously reported that the intelligence community actually helped build the software. The continuous praise seen in these documents shows that the collaboration paid off. Under the new “Palantir Model,” “data can come from anywhere” and can be “asked whatever the analyst wants.”'

Whilst the validity of these sources may be questionable, Dr. Sparkles and I are of the firm opinion that if these analytics tools are sufficient for bulk data collection and analysis for the intelligence community, their impact in private sector will be significant.",2020-12-31 16:55:28

"""But nobody knows what PLTR even does!!1""",0.87,"what PLTR actually does - MDM (Master Data Management - google it) is the biggest wish list for every single company right now that has more than one system in their IT stack. It lets you view one report/dashboard with data from multiple systems - Palantir does this and does it well.

PLTR basically, as far as their most popular product, allows companies to consolidate all their data into one big view/lens. Why is this needed? Because as almost all companies vest more and more into their IT stack, the more of a shit show it can become. Most mid to large companies have around 10+ internal systems they use to service their customers across all business units. Hell you might even work somewhere where you have to log into 6 different systems each day to do your job.

Reporting on the data in each of those systems even if they're integrated already can be super challeging - this is where Palantir comes in. EVERY company is needing this right now, MDM is becoming the hottest fucking thing in tech right now as far as ""wants"" by the executive/mid-level management teams in companies.

PLTR Shares vs. LEAPS,0.8,"I'm fairly new to trading, and currently own 62 shares of PLTR. This is a long play for me, as I can easily see myself holding this stock for a while, as I expect only good things from this company. Most people seem to agree.

If most people expect this company to have great growth over the coming years, what is the point of owning stocks? I'm asking this for self-educational purposes.

&#x200B;

Consider this:

60 shares vs. ATM LEAP 1/20/23 15C (similar cost basis). Let's say PLTR has an underlying value of $35 by 2022. The shares will grant you $595 profit, while the LEAP gives you $604 profit. Very similar profits.

Now for the interesting part. If PLTR remains at $25 by 2022 (pls no), the max loss with shares is $0 while the LEAP is around -$200. However, the upside to the LEAP is limitless. In this case, shouldn't you always purchase the LEAP over the shares? What are the chances PLTR is actually below $25 by 2022? I feel I'm missing something here.

Monday's market open saw an immediate meltdown and began this 🌈🐻  channel and Tuesday saw us drip below our $25 [support zone](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/supportandresistance/). After the Dec 7th run-up  🌈 🐻tried pulling us below $25 on the 10th and 16th, but we held the line. The 9 day MA trading below the 20 day MA suggests to me that this 🌈🐻trend will continue in the short term. [PLTR ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-PLTR/)is currently bouncing off the lower BB and against the upper crayon line I drew, the next pop is going to be volatile AF. If at market open we don't hold the fuck'n line, I believe that we'll probably gap down to the $20-$22 range.  


Personally, I think the trend is pointing that we'll finish the year below $25. This doesn't really bother me much, in the near term we have 2 catalyst dates in January and hype leading up to their [earnings](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/fundamental/) call on the 11th of Feb.

Pure speculation on my part, but if we see a big pump leading up this (my tendies hope so) then it could be likely to create a bit of a drop off. I'm too retarded to figure out the math on what this could actually be so feel free to comment your thoughts.

Link with a bunch of numbers I can't read that talks about amount of outstanding shares: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200929006146/en/Palantir-Announces-Additional-Update-Regarding-Outstanding-Shares-of-Common-Stock-and-Shares-Permitted-to-Be-Sold-Under-Lock-Up-Agreements](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200929006146/en/Palantir-Announces-Additional-Update-Regarding-Outstanding-Shares-of-Common-Stock-and-Shares-Permitted-to-Be-Sold-Under-Lock-Up-Agreements)

Also have seen theories that the recent filing from Mithril (Thiel) could just be a play for them to swallow up all these shares which could mitigate any drop.

Story from a retard - PLTR hole the line,0.87,"OK listen up. Here is a story for everyone. I used to be a young retard. Now I'm an old one. But there are some lessons to be learned from my young dumb and full of cum self. 

Lets take a trip to 2014. Graduated college and man I was going to make it big. Just moved to the city and I figured something out no one else did. swing trading. easy money. (so retarded I was buying and selling with a 7 dollar commission for each trade on merril edge). 

Well, I lost a lot of money. bar mitzvah money bye bye lmao. you know how long it took to get my hands on that moolah. 

But here is the lesson. Here is what I learned, and why I am going to HOLD PLTR FOR LONG TIME. These companies i bought. They kind of made it. in 2014, they seemed like a long shot. i lost money on almost all of them because they would go down 5-10% and i would be out. but if i held, man I would be looking good. 

Here are some of the positions from my 2014 realized gains/losses: 

Ariad Pharmacuticals - 2.1k shares. lost 840 dollars. Ariad was eventually bought by a japenese company i think and shot up like 70%. Fuck. 

Plug Power - 1,123 shares. all around 2.50. made 160. woohoo! We all know what happened with plug. 

Groupon - 110 shares at 8.54. At one point this this was like 130. lost 14 dollars. 

Irobot - 250 shares at around 48. lost $1,845. 

And these are just some examples, also had ballard power (loss), disney (small gain) etc. wow i suck.

If i just let these sit, well coulda woulda shoulda. But I will not make the same mistake again, I have 390 shares of PLTR and I AM HOLDING BECAUSE I BELIEVE AND I HAVE LEARNED PATIENCE.

Listen fellow retards, the analysts are sleeping on this stock. It's insanely undervalued. 

&#x200B;

From BBY last earnings call - “From a profitability standpoint, our better-than-expected sales resulted in significant operating income rate expansion and earnings growth,” stated Best Buy CEO Corie Barry. 

BBY is hands down the best managed retailer out there. So why is the stock tanking for the last 2 months? Because analysts are retarded and things have changed since the last reputable analyst call. Goldman downgraded the stock early december since they don't see how it can continue to grow. Since then, we have had $600 in direct payments AND we might get another $2,000. Last stimulus, majority of it went to durable goods aka electronics. The government wants to straight up give you money to buy PS5 AND Xbox with a 65"" TV to go along with it. Good thing BBY sells all of these AND they are preferred for electronics over any other retailers. 

But analysts don't want you to know that. Smart money is already accumulating BBY while you yolo PLTR.

PLTR - Technical/Fundamental Analysis from a Professional Investor - Update 12/29,0.89,"So a lot has happened with the shares.

The wedge looks like it has broken down, but it could easily be just an extension of a wedge. The point is that we don't have a full breakdown unless we spend considerable time below 25, then I could maybe see things fall back down to 20. I think it is far more likely we just remain in this extended consolidation phase of 25-30 until we get some sort of a catalyst or a short squeeze.

This was the primer I had written on Information Technology  back in 2017

[https://etherealvalue.wordpress.com/2017/02/25/technology-primer/](https://etherealvalue.wordpress.com/2017/02/25/technology-primer/)

I started by looking at the S&P500 since the early 1900s to understand if there was a mental model I could use to outperform the index. What I found was that starting in the late 1800s, most of the companies that ended up creating enormous shareholder value started as technology companies. Dupont was a technology company in the 1800s, Edison Electric was a technology company in the 1900s, GM was a technology company in the 1920s. If one looks at the market capitalization of companies today, many of the largest are today’s technology companies: Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft have market capitalizations which eclipse many old traditional industries.

There is clearly something about technology companies that allows them to generate enormous shareholder value and create wealth for society, after all, if the stock index was still dominated by the likes of American Cotton Oil and American Sugar Refining like in the 1900s, we would all be living in a different and much poorer world. The challenge with investing in technology companies is that for every Edison Electric there is a Zenith Radio. for every IBM there is a Sinclaire Rearch and for every Apple there is a Blackberry. There had to be a way to analyze or put into context why some companies last longer than others and why some managed to generate returns over a thousand fold for its investors while others fizzile and pop with the latest turn in the economic cycle.

I agree with Peter Thiel’s thesis that technology advancement is probably slowing down and primarily concentrated around information technology as a result of regulations around the “world of stuff”. I believe this will continue to be the trend of the next 20-30 years, with some exceptions and that the rise of AI may start creating innovation again in many static fields. I believe historically, there were massive innovation happening across multiple disciplines from the 1800s-1950s, where technological progress branched  out like a tree and built on itself. Since the 1970s or so, this branch narrowed  into only a few sectors, primarily focused in information technology.

So I wanted to strip out the massive amount innovations that have taken place around agriculture, communications, transportation, energy and petrochemicals over the past 100 years. It is helpful to think backwards if you will, focusing on just the age of computers and back into the late 1800s, into the birth of the electronic age. When we focus on just the computer led revolution in the 1950s and electricity revolution in the 1870s, we start seeing some interesting trends.

**Information Technology Cycles**

The following is my attempt at describing from a very high level the history of computing and informational technology. What I found was that technology moves both in cycles of proliferation and consolidation and that there is a directional theme.

Electronic Age

**Electricity/Scaled Power (1875-1900):** Platform competition and consolidation phase: Edison vs Tesla. Enterprise facing, originally to convince government and factory owners to replace physical labor.(Important companies: GE and Westinghouse)

**Electronics (1900-1925):** Electricity prices fall as infrastructure rollout, creating a proliferation of electronic hobbyists and startups. Hardware dominates first half, platform dominates next half. Consumer Facing.(Important companies: RCA, Zenith, Galvin (Motorola), most went belly up, upstream and downstream do well)

**Electronics Consolidation (1925-1950):** The electronics sector consolidates, with content platform operators (software) dominating, and winners usually emerge from previously niche targets.(Important companies: AT&T, NBC, IBM)

Computing/Software Age

**Computing/Scaled Electronic (1950-1975):** Platform consolidation: IBM and the seven dwarfs. Enterprise facing, originally to convince government and large scale enterprise to replace  basic mental labor.(Important companies: IBM)

**From Hardware to Software (1975-2000):** Computing price falls, creating a proliferation of hobbyists, IT startups and companies. Lots of PC makers who go bust, software and internet dominate in the second half.(Important companies: Intel, Microsoft, Apple, Dell, most early PC makers go belly up, up and downstream do well)

**Software Consolidation (2000-2025):** Sectors like Retail, information and social consolidate. Hardware continues to fall away to software as content platform start to dominate, winner is emerging across multiple sub verticals.(Important companies: Amazon, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent)

Cloud/AI Age

**Machine Learning (ML)/Smart Software (2025-2050):** Platform consolidation phase. Enterprise facing, convince companies this is the future of advanced mental labor. It will be about the use of AI at the industrial scale being adapted by corporations and governments for various analytical, resource management and decision making processes.(Candidate Important companies\*\*:\*\* AWS, Microsoft, Palantir, companies yet to exist in China)

**Specialized AI (2050-2075):** Machine learning/AI becomes cheaper, creating a proliferation of AI hobbyists and developers, high level programing focused, consumer facing. This will be about the proliferation of AI in our everyday lives. Just as how starting in the 1990s, the story of technology was one with the integration of computers and software to our daily lives, to some extent, outsourcing the memory/logic processing components of our lives to computers. Now, we will be calling upon multiple AIs to do many deal of the functions of our lives in perhaps faster input times (using neural interfaces). Companies and products could be formed in seconds from simply thinking through the process and outsourcing it to smart software who functionally construct its various parts in second to minutes depending on how quickly you can direct and scale your digital minions to do your bidding.(Candidate important companies: most will go bust, up and downstream will likely do well.)

**General AI (2075-2100):** Consolidation of Software/AI. It will be about the web linkages of human/AI integration. Whether this looks like some sort of neural net where we live in a web of information buffeted by our web of AI advisors.

The average core technology cycle seems to be approximately 75 years, with 25 years of infrastructure platform competition and roll-out, 25 years of new venture creation most of which gets washed out, and 25 years of industry consolidation.

The initial phase of the cycle is dominated by 1-3 players fighting it out in a standards war that then gets rolled out as the foundational infrastructure of the next 50 years:

In the initial phase, the general theme is that the companies start off as enterprise and government facing. In the historical electronics and computer cycle, there has been two such periods, the roll out of electrical grid by GE/Westinghouse and the roll out of mainframe computers by IBM. In the case of the AC vs DC standard war between Edison and Tesla, both men through their respective backers, GE and Westinghouse, to invent and supply standardized power equipment and build power plant, the initial consumers were local government to replace previous gas lamp systems with electrical street lamps and to factories. The new technology was seen as cheaper and more efficient than previously gas operated lambs operated by cities and more importantly, electricity delivered by wire is seen as much more efficient than having onsite power for factory operators, allowing for the displacement of onsite steam engines and boilers. The birth of the mainframe computer was similar, although less competitive. Due to an earlier lead and first mover position, IBM was able to dominate the market over its competitors, making them irrelevant. The mainframe computer was sold to large corporations and government defense agencies for the calculation of complex formulas that had previously required the employment of hundreds of staff. The two initial cycles produce two monopolistic businesses that are still DOW components today, GE and IBM, which set the standard for a drop in the price of electricity and computing that would benefit the next phase of the cycle.

The proliferation phase, the general theme is that there is a cheapening of the previous platform technology, electricity and computing power, which enables hobbyists to take advantage and start building new products in the electronics and PC space. This is characterized by period of high new firm creation, high levels of creativity and a move from enterprise focus to the consumer. We saw it in the 1900-1920s with the birth of the electronics industry, there were dozens of radio makers, appliance makers and various electronics manufacturing startups. During this time, there was heavy competition from the host of new hardware businesses, with most profits coming from IP licensing. A similar analogy could be made of the PC era of the 1980s-2000s, there was a lot of hardware makers, it was highly competitive, and the winners of the era were primarily focusing on software (ie Microsoft).

The consolidation phase, In the case of the 1920s, the commoditization of hardware created an opportunity for content providers. History is littered with names of large scale manufacturer that are now defuct, names like Zenith, admiral and dozens of electronics makers which use to hover mid-western industrial hubs such as Chicago. The content providers in Radio and TV became more dominant. Through the current consolidation phase, starting in 2000, we see less new venture creation and generally a focus on the content/distribution platform side of consumer technology. Amazon, Netflix, Google, Apple are key examples of the shift.

What it means today,

I would argue that we are in the consolidation part of the cycle until 2020-2025, where it will continue to be about shrinking number of consumer technology players and the dominance of content over infrastructure. This explains the phenomenal increase of FANG stocks relative to the rest of the market. As a result, for the next 5-10 years, if one can pick good entry points for Amazon (I will discuss my dislike of Google in a future post), one will be successful, and the company will likely last for a long time. It remains to be seen if Apple can create a bigger ecosystem. Contrarian value plays probably revolve around Chinese ADRs which are out of favor with the US public.

**From 2025 onward, the most exciting prospect is the idea of a repeat of the infrastructure buildout that happened at the onset of the electricity and computing age. I believe that the new phase will be targeting enterprise and government and will be a winner take all fight similar to the few cycles. The previous cycles revolved around scaled mechanical energy and scaled linear mental processing, I believe the next phase will revolve around advanced mental processing. I think that corporations and government while benefiting from scale, are beholden to inefficient decision making due to complicated management structuring.** The automation of complex management process that can analyze of complex large data and deploy resources more efficiently will become invaluable to large corporate/government clients. Companies that have potential in this space are big data players with big client channels like AWS and **Palantir** or emergent players which have yet to develop in the US or China. It is also possible that will come from a spinout team from one of current tech giants.

It is a serious mistake to continue to look for consumer plays in the technology space. I believe that the sector is consolidating and played out. New entrants will find it nearly impossible to survive at the downturn of the next cycle and current incumbents will solidity their positioning. The next batch of potentially interesting companies will likely come from the enterprise space. While Wall Street analysts continues to be focused on AWS and the fight over IaaS and PaaS, the most interesting segment to watch is in advanced analytics and resource allocation tools, which is ripe for innovation. There are lots of fat in the middle management layer of corporations and governments. I strongly believe that this space is where the next once in a generation infrastructure player (like GE and IBM) can offer an impressive solution which will fill the niche. The early identification of this company/companies will generate significant out performance relative to any market benchmark.

2020 Update:

If we are in the infrastructure roll-out stage than first mover absolutely has an advantage as we could see with GE, IBM and microsoft to some extent during the previous eras. In the consolidation ages, the last mover had an advantage. Amazon and Apple were not the first e-commerce or hardware makers, but are likely the last because they benefit from  a slow down of technology and a focus on ease of use and scale.  This is why every contract and sticky ones PLTR has is so important, because these relationships will scale in a non-linear way once AI and machine learning starts making its way into  large institutions and first mover advantage is very very important here, just like how GE was working around the clock to sign on factories and local governments for lighting and electricity contracts, once they were in, that is forever and they could start selling other equipment and devices all of which were collecting licensing or patent fees.

I have very high conviction on Palantir.  I believe the reason above is what drove Peter Thiel to invest into Palantir, because it is building the infrastructure layer for the age of AI and PLTR is primed to becoming the single most important company in technology for the next 2-3 decades and will be a 100-1,000x bagger.

Explaining the Palantir Mithril LP Merger Rymor,0.95,"Reposting with correct flair and positions.

&#x200B;

There is a link circulating which folks are taking to mean that Palantir has been acquired by Thiel's venture capital firm, Mithril LP.

Link here: [https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/premerger-notification-program/early-termination-notices/20210675](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/premerger-notification-program/early-termination-notices/20210675)

This is a bit misleading. This FTC notice is not showing the completion of a merger, but actually is showing approval for an early termination of the Harte-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Waiting Period of a pre-merger process.

The HSR period is a 30 day period where parties to a merger or significant asset transfer make submissions to the FTC and DoJ. This is a component of several standard procedures required by the HSR act, which is basically just a series of antitrust regulations that I'm too retarded to understand.

Link:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart%E2%80%93Scott%E2%80%93Rodino\_Antitrust\_Improvements\_Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart%E2%80%93Scott%E2%80%93Rodino_Antitrust_Improvements_Act)

So, it could be that a majority stake PLTR has been acquired by Mithril, but we do know how much exactly or when this acquisition will take place. All the FTC has said is that in this case the 30 day waiting period to file notifications isn't necessary. Perhaps Thiel and PLTR did all of the document filing really fast or some shit I don't know. Thiel mentioned in the earnings call that Mithril MIGHT take a controlling stake.

HOWEVER, According to the FTC, the HSR Act must also be followed (including the 30 day HSR period) in the event of a **large transfer of assets of just about any kind**, so this notice may not be the confirmation of a majority stake acquisition, but rather the confirmation of Mithril just buying shares in excess of 62.8mm USD (if you exceed this amount you MUST report under the HSR act). Similar HSR early terminations have been approved for other sharebuyers since the DPO. This analysis makes much more sense I think.

What does this mean for shareholders? If it's the case that Mithril buys up a large tranche of the float that would certainly be bullish and would definitely squeeze the shorts, but Mithril has only maybe 1B USD AUM ([https://aum13f.com/fund/mithril-lp](https://aum13f.com/fund/mithril-lp)). Is this enough to buy a controlling stake? Somebody who is less retarded than me can do the math.

**TL;DR, Palantir probably not being acquired, but Mithril is buying shares in Palantir to the tune of 62 million or greater. ROCKETS.**

And here’s why, I rely on my cousin to loan me money to keep my weed/delta 8 inventory supplied, and he is getting a MBA at a top school right now and is recruiting investment banking for Sponsors groups.  He told me that he was having a call with a person at one of those big banks that’s not Goldman Sachs, and that that group told him they had met with Bumble and Bill Ackman recently.  It just now occurred to me that that was a PSTH de-SPAC meeting and Ackman is assessing them as a target.  Stripe is off Bumble is on.  This would go right in line with Bill Ackman’s woke empowerment angle.  

I don’t know if that makes sense as a long-term play, but it would definitely pop in the short term if it were announced.  Blackstone could be looking to monetize on its investment last year.  

It is a SPAC, and probably the best most likely yo pop SPAC on the market. Worst case I get most of my money back, but this thing is going to the 🚀 🚀 🚀 🌝",2020-12-29 06:06:23

The 'Tutes' vs PLTR compared to SNOW and AI... and why PLTR is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for retail investors (until now... ),0.96,"It should surprise no one that Institutional Investors and Hedge Funds love the traditional IPO process: a company wants to raise money and provide liquidity for their stock, so they engage the entrenched financial industry in a process of listing shares on a public exchange to raise capital to fund growth.

The underwriters organize a horse show to hype the stock to the Tutes, whonunderstand that a similar barrage of media hype will be produced to stoke the fires of retail demand. The company gets funded, often above their initially defined goals, and the Tutes get in at a price that leaves plenty of room for a 'pop' on the debut of the stock's trading: when retail investors hungry for the opportunity to own the stock pay market value at whatever price shares start trading, the Tutes make instant profits.

SNOW and AI both conformed to the industry paradigm, performed traditional IPOs, and despite being egregiously overvalued,  have continued to rise from even their debut prices to push the limits of valuation to absurd levels (I'm not talking about IPO prices, but the prices at which they started trading).

I have no problem with the 'forward looking growth'' theory behind the valuation of these stocks, but the more I research and understand the business models behind SNOW, Ai, and PLTR, the more I feel the IPO industry is simply punishing PLTR for doing a direct listing rather than performing an IPO that would have given the Tutes their presumably entitled benefits.

Let's pause for moment to explain this to anyone who doesn't understand the traditional IPO process vs direct listings.

SNOW and AI both entered public trading on the stock market through the traditional IPO process. Both companies are burning through cash faster than they are earning it, and opted to raise their next round of financing by engaging with a group of underwriters (Goldman, Merril, etc) to create a bunch of new shares and sell them - generally these shares are sold to institutional investors: hedge funds, pension funds, high net worth individuals,  and other 'smart money' pools of significant capital. Retail investors (you and me) are left out. 

For weeks, the company, with the guidance (connections provided by) their underwriters, pitch their company to these Tutes, and the Tutes have decades long relationships with these underwriters upon which they understand that this process is designed to ensure their mutual profit.  There is an entire indistry built around launching these IPOs to ensure that the Tutes make an instant profit by allowing them to purchase shares at a price that meets the debuting company's financial goals, while a parallel media mechanism is deployed that hypes and justifies relatively absurd valuations to retail investors. The end result being a process where Tutes are able to buy a stock at an IPO price that is significantly less than the price at which retail investors can buy it later in the day.

SNOW IPO price: $120.
SNOW debut trading price: $245

AI IPO price: $42
AI debut trading price: $101

Ok, crazy, right?
But here's the thing, the 'analysts' and major publications that influence retail investment behaviour all supported these valuations as though they were justified by future growth expectations! All they talked about was the importance of data analytics and artificial intelligence. No hesitation, no doubt, no talk about risk or downside, just pure unadulterated pump and hype.

Funny thing is, SNOW and AI seem to be as closely aligned in terms of business model to PLTR as any other products/services I have researched. All 3 provide software services that allow large organizations to more effectively aggregate, visualize, and apply AI to large data sets for the ultimate purpose of making critical business decisions. 

But here's the thing... when PLTR decided to float their stock on the public exchange via a direct listing, rather than through a typical IPO process, the Tutes got left out... and they were clearly pissed.

The number of disinformation articles I read that tried to paint Palantir as just a consultancy, with too much exposure to a particular political party or government contracts in general, or lack of profitability (despite being cash flow positive), was a clear relflection of the industry's attempt to punish and apply downward pressure on the PLTR share price.

Funny thing is, we now know that many hedge funds have been loading up on PLTR while their media counterparts were depressing the share price. I expect we'll learn that more have been doing the same since then, and I suspect that many have been hoping to keep the share price as low as possible until the lockup period expires sometime in Feb/March.

It's pretty ridiculous when an analyst like Barron's downgrades the stock rating while simultaneously increasing their price target from just a month previous by nearly 50%.

It seems that almost everyday I read an article that chastises the retail investment market for pumping PLTR to a share price that equates to a 50x revenue multiple, yet they are ok with SNOW trading at a revenue multiple of over 175x, AI trading at over 90x. Meanwhile SNOW and AI generated revenue in the $250M ballpark in the last year, while PLTR posted over $1B.

PLTR direct listed their shares on Sept 30, 2020 at $10/share, and unlike SNOW and AI, did not feel the need to raise amy funds in the process. You would think that indicated financial strength for a company.

Had PLTR gone public via a traditional IPO and followed the trend of every other tech related stock to IPO this year, the IPO price may have started at $10 and inflated to an IPO price in the $20-30 range before debuting for retail trading in the $50-60 range.

With the IPO industry's promotional hype and backing, the stock likely goes up from there, or at least holds and pops on every new government contract headline.

Instead, the Tutes played a game of disinformation - holding the price down below $10 for the first month of trading while quietly building their positions. But then the silent period expired, earnings were released, the cat got out of the bag, and even Shitron Tweets could only temporarily subdue the rally.

It seems like the only headwind in site is the lockup period. And with plenty of involvement with Covid vaccine rollout, seemingly weekly new government contracts, upcoming promotional events, and a lilely stellar ER, there's no reason not to expect PLTR to soon join the lofty valuations of SNOW and AI in the upcoming months.

+++

... and here's why this opportunity to buy in alongside, instead of after, the Tutes take their positions.

This past week, the NYSE approved the decision to allow companies to do a direct listing WHILE raising additional capital for their company in the process (PLTR did a direct listing without raising additional funds).
The incentive for companies to pursue the traditional IPO process, which has proven to leave substantial funds on the table, while primarily benefitting the underwriters and their clients (the Tutes), may be significantly disrupted. 

And similarly to the way in which SPACs have provided more parity for retail investors to buy into stocks before Tutes have taken their pound of flesh, the next round of direct listings should provide previously unavailable opportunities for retail investors to take positions in newly traded companies at levels alongside, rather than underneath, those of institutional investors. 

Am praying that Roblox and a few other upcoming debuts decide to follow this path as well.

Week of Dec 28th Watchlist,0.74,"Review from last weeks post

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kghdix/week\_of\_dec\_21st\_watchlist/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kghdix/week_of_dec_21st_watchlist/)

1) NET @ 84.50<, closed @ 84.98, +1%>

2) EDIT @ 64.75<, closed @ 83.53, +29%

3) CRSR @ 40.40<, closed at 36.35, -10%

For CRSR, I took a loss on it. I would never hold a stock when I'm -7/8% on the position from entry, its telling you that something is off. Maybe ur timing, maybe the overall market, doesnt matter what it is, it just matters that you get out and figure it out after. I normally take losses anywhere from 1-5%, depending on a variety of factors. Great example of how the ""level"" doesnt always work. Love that. 

&#x200B;

As for this week here is what I am looking at (I currently dont see a ton of set ups, that is information).

1) PLTR @ 29<, this is the level, if you can watch the price action here, do it, it is volatile, but I think if it breaks thru this area it has a strong chance of moving closer to 40-45. Needs to see volume for me to have strong conviction. Also, im happy to get chopped up in here a few times (if thats what happens) just to catch a portion of the BO. I really like the risk reward at this level.

2) DKNG @ 55<, similar to PLTR, getting tight and im trying to see if it will break out above that 55-56 area, I like the decreasing volume here in this tight little range, looks like it is coiled. We shall see though.

&#x200B;

Both of these positions I would play smaller, not because they are volatile, but because I have a good year and Im not looking to ""press the gas"" right at the end. Im content. Im looking fwd to next year. Good luck everyone, and congrats on making it through 2020, a year most will never forget.

The Importance of Ambiguity in the Meme Market,0.93,"We have been in the meme market for a while now, and a big aspect of the big winners has been **ambiguity**. 


It's easy to visualize what Carnival Cruise does. They sell vacations on boats. The opposite is true for Palantir - they sift through data to enable their clients to operate as efficiently as possible. Whereas Carnival is limited to the high seas and island excursions, Palantir promises (and has shown) improvements in a variety of industries, whether it is helping police departments catch criminals or aiding Ferrari's racing efforts. 


In short, if we were to visualize various industries as a geographical map where companies covered their respective interests, the borders for a cruise company would be clear, whereas Palantir's borders would be fuzzy.


These fuzzy lines easily allow for more hype to be drum up. There have been dozens of articles over the past months about various contracts PLTR has acquired, from vaccine distribution to military operations, keeping them in the news and our short attention spans focused on them.  


This is why Tesla has excelled. Musk is constantly promoting different industries Tesla can expand to, even if it is unclear how they will get there. Not only does he reference sub-groups in the auto industry, but he links Tesla to other ambitious projects, from the battery industry to public transportation.


Not to mention, if we are in a bubble, then it would make sense people would invest in companies whose market potential is hard to define. *You can't say a stock has hit it's ceiling if you can't define the ceiling in the first place.* This gives you an easy excuse to throw fundamentals out the door (albeit a silly one).


Usually uncertainty is bad news in the stock market, but now it is embraced as potential. Personally, I am going to accept our new meme overlords by investing in **ARKK** and **ARKG**. Innovation should continue to rise as the meme markets thrive, and the Genetic Revolution is a potential trillion dollar industry once unlocked. Think of genetics as a desert sun transported over a frozen tundra - in the dawn slowly showing it's head over the snow capped mountains, soon to thaw our new lives as midday finally comes.

Renaissance IPO ETF,0.88,"I’m sure some of you know Renaissance has an ETF dedicated to IPO’s ($IPO) but I’m also sure some of you don’t. Basically if you knew and didn’t hold it, you missed out on some super low risk gains and if you didn’t know obviously you missed out too. 

For full disclosure, I didn’t hold it, but I just checked it this morning and it’s up 216% since March. Yes I’m happy with my big PLTR gains and some small QS ones, but as much as I am a fan of maxing out my gains, I also like to do so with the best sharpe ratio possible. So I think $IPO might have a good run next year too. 

The big IPO’s I’m waiting for in 2021 are R0bl0x, Affirm, and Petco, and I will literally be betting my entire portfolio that these will be winners. I mean come on, Petco’s ticker will literally be $WOOF. So I will be buying these ones in particular, but aside from these, I really am not too sure about the others. 

I bet there will be nice 60% - 100%ers, but I know we’re going to be seeing a lot of what happened with ABNB and DASH, so maybe reverting back to the classic WSB SPY days will be the play, except just with $IPO instead of SPY.

PLTR lockdown expiration bullish thesis,0.86,"First of all not sure if this qualify as DD, if not let me know and I’ll change it! 

Did a lot of evening lecture on PLtR...

So many people expect it to drop when share lockdown gets removed sometimes in February from my understanding...

80% of the floats can free trade after this... def gonna be a drop for the SP since a % will take some profit...

However hear me out...

From now until that moment, we can have new NR of deals or renewed deal like we had lately... We will have demo day and ER which will demonstrate a continuation of revenu rise...

An other point I want to talk about is the fact that most of the people with that 80% float... are mostly insider, people with deep knowledge of what is palantir, their power, their goal and their future...

Now if I was working with them with 1 million of shares... lockup ends... if I’m convinced in what we do... might sale 10% for let’s say around 2.7M$... more than enough to buy nice stuffs... however with that knowledge expecting it to rise probably in a 50-100$ range... wouldn’t sell more than that 10% ...

PLTR trade a lot of shares everyday over 50M...

Fund managers couldn’t get into an iPO or Spac...

So in short I don’t believe the SP will drop that much on the lockup event... either it will have rise enough with the events I spoke about and might test new support of where we are currently consolidating but I truly don’t expect a dip under 20$...

Then there will be a strong « dip » buying from PLTR beeing a meme stock and all the funds wanting to get in while it’s cheap...

Also if it dosen’t fall like so many expect...

I’m pretty sure it’s gonna initiate a strong FOMO which could create a strong mania buying and rocket it to over 40$.... we’ve been cranking up for breakout!

So basically PLTR 30$ calls jan 21, may 40c (could also be shorter like march call

Buying shares and getting some cash ready to buy more when and if that dip occurs...

2021 will be the year where PLTR gets noticed big time

Now off to bed!

TLDR; everyone expect a dip on lockup expiration... inverse them buy everything PLTR before, on the exp and after",2020-12-26 06:36:38
Why 2020 capitalism is not as weird as it seems and PLTR valuation is not as weird as it may seems,0.87,"Merry Christmas, retards. After the guy that posted about Graham's book (that I am reading right now) inspired me to post this to teach some differences between back and now and why 2020 capitalism is not as weird as it may seems.

TECH COMPANIES DOESN'T DO CAPITAL EXPENDURES.

At least, not as much as an old company would do.

Take Walmart. Imagine that Walmart had 1B of earnings at their income statement. Great! The guys of Walmart could think ""I think I can build 20 new stores that will make for my shareholders even more money in the future!"". So he takes 500M of those 1B and build that juicy new stores that will make Walmart even more money in the future. The other 500M he will deliver to shareholders through buybacks or dividends.

When you read the P/E ratio of companies like Walmart it will make sense. They are making profit and, even better, they are reinvesting that profit to make even more profits in the future.

Nice.

What about companies like Palantir?

For a software company like Palantir there's two main ways for them to make money. They have to spend HUGE money in salespeople to sell their software and HUGE money in research and development to make even better software to sell in the future.

Palantir is building its Walmart stores through their income statement. Firstly, it's great because Palantir diminishing its profit makes then to pay less taxes. Why is that? Because the boomers that created accounting didn't understand how a software/tech company works.

Boomers at Wallstreet can't understand that many companies invest through their income statement.

If the folks at Salesforce would decide to make the company profitable, they could at a glance. They would keep only the developers needed to keep the business running and only the sales people to take care of the current customers. But they know that they can make even more money, so all the profit they earn they spend reinvesting on the business.

Even Berkshire Hathaway can understand today why paying expensive sales multiples (not earnings, sales) on Snowflake isn't a bad idea.

*I am not saying that at 40x revenue Palantir is at a fair valuation or not. It's just an example. But it explains why it seems that profits doesn't matter anymore. They matter. Accounting that doesn't keep up with the times.",2020-12-26 03:36:39

GME DD fresh perspectives Pt 3 Future of Gamestop + Squeeze teaser. Christmas Edition.,0.97,"Guys, I’m sorry I did not do a good job at painting the picture yesterday. I was pretty tired from a 4 hour hike and I really wanted to put it up earlier than later so more people would be exposed to it.

A lot of what I wanted to deliver got lost in the ‘Amazon vs GME’. I see it myself. Thank you to all that offered constructive criticism.

**\*\*If you still worry that Gamestop might go back down to $16.00, I invite you to take a few minutes to read this as this would put the concern to rest. This DD is a bit longer, but I am VERY confident in what I'm laying down below.\*\***🚀

Here we go:

**The Future of Gamestop/PowerUP**

**How many of you guys have one of these? Phones, GoPro, drones, VR gear, tablets, gimbal stabilizer?**

Of those who answered yes which would be everyone, how many of you did one of these with the old device when you upgraded?

A) Sold it on eBay and hoped to god every day you don’t get scammed until they could no longer open a case against you or pray USPS doesn’t lose the item or get delayed and have the buyer open a return/case as a result.

B) Sold it on Craigslist/Facebook/Kijiji and dealt with time wasters/low ballers/no-shows blowing up your phone which could only made you look popular in front of your crush only to finally have someone show up to offer you $50.00 less than your price which you clearly stated was a FIRM price because of a scratch you mentioned in the ad was ‘worse than they thought’ or that’s just all they had.

C) Gave it to a friend/relative/stash it in your drawer because you can’t be bothered with A or B

D) (Phones only) Don’t really love your friends/relatives as much as you love what you can do with the cash/they don’t want it more than you want the cash but don’t want to deal with A or B so you just took a lowball offer At&T, Verizon…etc gave you which was easily $100\~200 below the fair market price?

**How many of you guys are ok with buying one of those devices used but you ultimately end up buying new because of:**

A) Getting scammed, buying a fake device/something being broken… etc etc

B) You can’t be bothered to deal with sellers who are not honest in their description.

C) The ideal unicorn seller is too far away.

**Can you relate? Of course you can.**

One day you buy a 1080P drone, next year they come out with 2.7K, next year they come out with 4K, year after that they come out with a 4K that fits in your pocket, and you can’t help but feel like you are just living in the past, or at least, left feeling like you are holding the bag like you bought PLTR at $29.

I have some of those devices, and I end up upgrading AT LEAST one of them every 1\~2.5 years just like you.

* Wouldn’t it be nice if there was a place nearby that you can just go to get a fair value for your trade in (maybe $50 less than you could get online but you don’t have to waste any time)?
* Wouldn’t it be nice if there was a brick and mortar place nearby you can count on that can’t just change their number/disappear tomorrow, have the ability to deliver your order to you in 1 hour AND offer returns AND offer 90 days warranty? What? I can buy extended warranty too?
* If there was one, and you just had to pay $50 on top of what you could find them for online otherwise, would you really bother with anything else? Would anyone?

**Don’t think about Gamestop for a second and be honest with yourself. If you answered yes to all 3, upvote this post. If you answered no to any of the above, just give it some time. You just haven’t experienced the inconvenience/pain yet.**

Ok, I get your point but there is no one that can offer something like this. Not **yet.**

Look, I know back in our days, Gamestop is where you went to get hustled but that’s going to change 180.’ Gamestop will change its name to “PowerUp” to be relevant in the broader consumer electronics field while retaining its gaming foundation.

So Ryan Cohen showed you guys that he’s serious about buying Gamestop upping his stake recently. It also said in 13D that he will do whatever is in the shareholders’ best interest. There was no new 13D posted today. **Meaning? The price rise was organic this week. Not from him buying. Shorts shook you a couple of times. You guys held. You guys did very good.**

Have you ever looked into what Chewy does in terms of customer service? Have you read up anything about Ryan Cohen to see what he/his father stands/stood for when it comes to customer experience? They are about selling goods that will make the customer the most happy not selling stuff that makes the most profit, funny enough, profit follows when you give customers what would make them the most happy and you end up making the most profit anyways. I speak from experience.

What made Bezos so successful is his focus on customer experience also. All entrepreneurs out there, please remember my spiel about customer experience at least. It’s the realest thing I or anyone can tell you. Do not ever fight with customers. Kill them with kindness if anything.

I bet you my last dollar this is what Cohen sees in Gamestop. The locations, the brand presence, 55M PowerUp members many of whom are already cultured on going through Gamestop’s revolving door because you get more store credit than cash and you are just accustomed to it.

**But c’mon man $50? How is the company going to make any money?** Look at the spread between bid and ask. It’s $50 each way from the mid-price (fair market price). That’s $100.00 profit for the company.

Still, only $100.00? Yeah, that’s actually 2X what they make off of console sales.

Every one of you, I know you said yes to my questions above, so do the math, upgrading at least one of the devices every 1\~2.5 years. Under this vision, it will be like 10 new consoles are being released every year for Gamestop AT LEAST. It will AT LEAST outdo BestBuy 26.55B market cap. Meaning Gamestop will do at least 20X within the next 5 years.

**“Yeah but Amazon sells used too? Didn’t you see?”**

Not like this. Used items on Amazon is more like buying stuff on eBay. Often relying on the seller’s description and the seller’s shipping. Can you drop your item off to Amazon and get cash? No

Imagine, the items are accurately described, it arrives in 1 hour via Doordash/Uber eats and there is no fuss no muss.

Then, after you bought the device, they just do this 1 simple thing.

1 week after you bought the thing they send you a text

*“Hey Autist, just wanted to check in, how’s your new dildo flexing so far? It’s gwon? Iight, good to hear. We are here if you have any questions/concerns. Have a nice day”*

Cohen will do at least this. I guarantee you, except he will add some more personal/relatable touch like “the 4K 69 Mega Pixel camera on that bitch really is something else huh?” As a cherry on top, there it is, one thing we can’t mistake for anything else. A FUCKIN ROCKET EMOJI at the end of the message. Wouldn’t you feel loved?  🚀

**Oh yeah, add this to the books.** With millions of us retail WSB autists holding GME, think about what that does for the PR when the squeeze happens and it WILL HAPPEN because $16 is where all the shorts are under water, and we ARE NEVER going below that. They’re paying fees right now and they will eventually cover. It will do wonders for the business' image.

Good chance the squeeze will happen like Tesla’s, 4X+ ing over a couple of months as they start to prove their vision and show that they are there to stay. (Source A). This is the bare minimum (or bear minimum). GME squeeze set up is a lot more potent but 'slowly but surely' is how it typically squeezes against diamond hands, diamond balls institutional shorts. 10X+++ ing as they bring their vision to reality.

&#x200B;

[See October 19 to Feb 20](https://preview.redd.it/zag3ukfz57761.jpg?width=959&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba0b9ad0b7878c5f6fd49829d2fe16e719320ee4)

That is of course, unless Cohen was just waiting for the new year for tax purposes to acquire more and announce that “oh yeah guys, I actually have enough options, shares now to buy the company”

He rides the squeeze, sell 25% shares, profit from that alone will pay for the business acquisition when it comes back down to its value as it is today of around $40 before heading to outdo BestBuy as I mentioned before (20X, that's $400/share in 5 years -being conservative, it can happen in less time🚀🚀🚀). The positive profit they would MOST CERTAINLY generate from this console cycle will more than pay for the restructuring. He still remains a major shareholder with 25%. His best interest will always be scaling GME.

Sherman for example, he owns 2% Bezos owns a little over 10%

**Do you want to think really long term?**

YouTube knew from Day 1 they were going to put ads one day, but they wanted to make it as sweet as possible for it to be engrained in you first – think video, think Youtube.

The day will come, think upgrading your device, whether it is new or used, think **PowerUP (more suitable name than Gamestop while retaining the gaming image)**

My point is, that they can increase the $100 spread if they wanted to, once it's habitual for us to make the sale/trade/purchase of a consumer electronics device at PowerUP as it is for us to order something on Amazon right now. For devices that are less liquid like computers/laptops the spread will likely be bigger from the start of course.That's only if you are still so hung up on making only $100/device because I, a nobody without a store/reputation could easily run around myself and flip 20 devices/week. Try it. Consumer electronics in a high population density areas are SUPER LIQUID. Remember Gamestop is everywhere dense population is (not talking the smooth brain kind of dense here)

How about this? When you bring your trade in, you get only $50 less than the classifieds’ resale value when you take store credit, but if you want cash, we can only give you $75 less than the classifieds’ resale value and vice versa. There, I just made the spread 50% more, $150 profit/device for Gamestop, and I made you more likely to return. Happy?

Bezos knew he wasn’t going to sell just books down the road.  
Elon Musk knew he wasn’t signing up to build just cars.  
Savvy business people that can build billion dollar business from scratch like Ryan, Elon and Bezos can anticipate moves years down the road.

The sky is the limit.

**We are just at the beginning, and I'm not done yet.You think I'm out to lunch? They're already getting started in the broader consumer electronics field (as mentioned in Pt2 of my DD). If you really can't relate, it's ok, it's probably because you are deep in #1 (as mentioned in Pt1 of my DD)**

My position:  Shares as well as options JAN 15 15C, 30C, APR 16 30C. GME makes majority of my port.

P.S :

Ryan, if you are reading this. I know you see the picture because it's the obvious picture. I’m in the space, and you’re right on the money in regards to the things you preach and do in regards to customer service/customer experience. I got some ideas brainstormed from writing these DDs I can offer (not asking for anything). I can see where you can save in shipping between stores, how the listing ‘system’ can be so all employees can take pictures and describe the items with consistency like how all McDonalds employees can make burgers with consistency… etc etc just to start. Feel free to reach out to me.No? Ok, you will compete with me a few years down the road. Just kidding.

**To all you guys & Ryan. Happy Holidays/Merry Christmas.Wishing you and your family nothing but the best this holiday season, yours truly**

**- Dildoflexing (You can call me Greendildoflexing when it squeezes)**

Citron will publish this soon for PLTR. 🚀🚀🚀,0.91,,2020-12-24 20:05:30
PLTR: The Golden Child of WSB 🏆,0.93,"Merry Christmas Eve people it’s time to give the jolly gift of Palantir to your loved ones. On this shortened market day I bought the dip on PLTR as it was down about -3.5%. 

I believe that PLTR is a solid company and I have a PT of $40 within the next 3-4 months, so this is the play. 

Position: March 19 $40C 

The DD:
- As some of you might know PLTR is still not profitable but I have faith that the PayPal mafia will turn that around for the company. this companies leadership is incredible and it will be shown in the upcoming month. Also the CEO has ties with Papa Elon so that’s always a plus. 

- In addition, we have all seen how PLTR reacts to catalysts and as it hovers in the 25-28 dollar range it is primed for another moon mission. The March calls allow enough time for a serious catalyst to run up the price. 

- Also. EARNINGS BABY!!!! PLTR will report earnings on March 15 and we all know the pump that will result from this. This is close to expiration but the run up to earnings will pump up the value of the option, and the plan is to sell before Theta and IV fuck you. 

- Finally, the sentiment around PLTR is amazing. Many funds are buying it or already bought into it pre-ipo. They are all long on this company and I expect a PT boost from many institutions and hopefully this will happen early into the new year

All in all, PLTR MOON MISSION and may the tendies be with you, always. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",2020-12-24 19:46:34
Why buying pltr @ $25 or $30 right now won't matter in next 20 or 100 years 🚀🚀🚀 this is like buying Coca Cola in 1919,0.77,"The Coca Cola purchase was famous because it was the first major investment where Buffett paid much more relative to earnings and assets than he did for most of his other investments.

Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger started buying Coca Cola in 1988. By the end of the year, Berkshire Hathaway owned 14,172,500 shares which cost $592.54 million. In 1989, they bought 9,177,500 additional shares for $431.38 million. By the end of 1989, they owned a total of 23,350,000 shares or 6.2% of the company which they bought for $1.023 billion. Their stake was so big that it accounted for almost 35% of Berkshire Hathaway's entire common stock holdings.

If you had invested $40 into a single share of Coca-Cola in 1919 during the IPO, you own 9,216 shares after all the stock splits over the years. This equates to $394,500 as of March 26, 2020. If you had reinvested dividends, your investment would be worth over $10 million. This represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.27% from 1919 to 2012.

Reason for this post is when Buffet started investing in Coca-Coca in 1987 ,people thought Coke ride is over . Coke established in 1892 so that means he was investing in this company after almost 100 years, they went public in 1919 at $40 so someone made a calculation which I heard in some lectures that after first 20 years passed of its IPO t 1919, if someone had invested fresh $40 in 1938 in Coke stock then in 1993 it would be $25000 . The stock has split two times since 1994, bringing Berkshire's ownership to 400 million shares. The cost basis on those shares is $1.299 billion. At the current stock price of $51.71 per share, Berkshire's investment in Coke is worth $20.7 billion. That leaves an unrealized gain of $19.4 billion on the investment.

The gains are even larger when factoring in dividends. At Coke's current quarterly payout of $0.40 per share, Berkshire's 400 million shares will bring in $640 million over the next year in dividend income. Since 1995, it has earned about $7 billion in dividends from the Coke investment.",2020-12-24 17:41:00
"Hello $BABA holders, please don't $ROPE",0.91,"I am Chinese, or used to be years ago at least by nationality. I am not going to post Chinese news article detailing the entire power struggle, just English. I mean, you monkeys can't read moon runes.

You see, the power struggle has been happening since Alibaba and Jack Ma became the ecommerce god of China, like Jeff ""the bald Grinch"" Bezos did with Amazon in America. China are commies, worshipping anyone but the party is illegal. That is why despite the profits and everything else, they are still sitting at 300+ and not flying like AMZN. Chinese know the power struggles all to well, smart ones will avoid it like plague. Not even Chinese boomers are touching it.

https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Mystery-video-suggests-power-struggle-in-China

The previous power struggles resulted in Ma forced out of CEO position in 2018, cue lip service to western friends who don't give a fuck just to make sure BABA don't drop. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/10/18/alibabas-jack-ma-spent-10-years-preparing-for-his-retirement.html

But like anyone who had felt the power trip of being the richest and most powerful man before, Ma could not stay retired and out of the limelight for long.

So he came out of retirement with the biggest fintech IPO in Asia, Ant Group. Now, that really pisses the Emperor off. Recognising his efforts in revolutionalizing ecommerse, Emperor Xi decided to let him spend the rest of his life in retirement... like a charity case. Yet he decides to step in limelight again, and overshadow the most ~~paranoid and insecure~~ powerful man in all of China?! Well Emperor is the party and party is the Emperor, now Emperor finally decides that you must be removed. Especially when they are showing the entire China the power and money capitalism brings. Cue CCP vs CEO power struggle round 2, except this time they are clashing in the open.

https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/China-up-close/Analysis-Xi-sees-Alibaba-and-Tencent-as-rising-threats-to-power

""Wait so why western crowds don't know???""

Uh you retards know you don't read right?

So what happens?

Buy the dip??

Cut losses and run???

Answer is simple:

If you are holding stocks then just keep holding it. BABA isn't going anywhere, they are the ecommerce monopoly along with Tencent in almost the entire Asia. The dip will not stop until power struggle turmoil is over, it will get even uglier over the months as Politburo falsify more charges to threaten the CEOs to back down.

Recover your call losses with puts, it really is that easy.

I have no options in it because I hate commies and know how they work. So until there is a clear winner in the power struggle, I am not gonna be a bad retard. If you want to listen, cool. If you think it's the dip you were waiting for, good luck with welfare because I tried. Then again I YOLO 50k each on GME and PLTR so what do I know? 🚀",2020-12-24 16:53:03

Weed stocks to the moon,0.68,"Aight retards, hear me out (under your own discretion cus I'm probably more retarded than most of you) because I've got a hunch 

So I know we all enjoyed the memes from the ~~Trump~~  JPow era (some more than others) but for the better or the worse, we got another retard coming to the WH to do the same autistic stuff for a different party. But maybe this new retard can get us some cash, which in the end is all you filthy degenerates care about. I know most of y'all here can't read more than the 4 letters of the ticker, ""to the Moon"" and ""PLTR"" so to keep it short: Biden made it one of his policies to get us legalized weed on a federal level, and even if that doesn't work, many states will legalize (or rather, did so) it through ballot initiatives. This, for those who still haven't sobered up yet, means we might have a new market rising in the US 

Aside from that we've had interesting movements in the weed market, for instance, a week ago Aphria Inc. (APHA) and my current bet Tilray (TLRY) announced a merger that'll make them the biggest cannabis producer in the world, and not just that [they're planning to enter the US market](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisroberts/2020/12/17/after-blockbuster-merger-worlds-largest-cannabis-company-eyes-us-market/?sh=161d09b87d65), which can make it a good investment for those here who aren't autistic and can sit on a stock for more than a week. And today particularly has been good for the weed sector, just 4 hours ago Aurora (ACB) spiked 7.4%, Canopy Growth (CGC) went up 6.7% and my TLRY got an 8.2% an hour ago (still red on that one tho lmao), not to mention that these stocks seem to be rather cheap for the kind of market (TLRY was trading at 200 at some point) so if you managed to save some of your tuition money from the PLTR short, or if you can ask your wife's bf, now might be the time, just saying ;)",2020-12-23 21:59:31

Okay for real I was one of those people who thought you guys were effing stupid.  I just took the opposite of your trades and sold the Theta and laughed at your stupid loss porn.  But no fucking JOKE this group has power.

Are we pointing out a HUGE HUGE fucking problem with Algo triggered buying and selling by manipulating the markets???? Sure we are!  But so do major investors doing the same thing.  We just have the power to the people this time around.

But I don't Give a flying FUCK.🚀🚀🚀🚀

PLTR - Technical Analysis from a Professional Investor - Update 12/22,0.96,"Told you 25 was the bottom

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kdrvdm/pltr\_technical\_analysis\_from\_a\_professional/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kdrvdm/pltr_technical_analysis_from_a_professional/)

We are going to 40-45, mid January. Originally was targeting beginning of the year because we looked like we were moving 50% faster than the run-up of NIO and about 100% faster than TSLA , now it looks like the moves are about the same as NIO, so a target of 40-45 to late January is a safer bet. This is why I told you guys to use 1/15 and 5/21 calls, because you can roll those with less theta decay.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9ayjurt9xr661.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=aabc196dfa12af7353fb341180c3630f7123f8d7

I rolled half of my 1/15 30 strikes to now 2/19 30 strikes with a slight hit (10% off purchase price) and increased the 2/19 30 strike position by 100%.  Basically increased total option positions by 50% to now 60k. Holding about 130k in shares.

I expect us to be pinned around 27-28 before Christmas, then we'll have another run up to 31-33 when the shorts unwind for the gamma pin on monday/tuesday. Then a pinning of around 29-31 before year end. Then we'll have a large rally for the first 2-3 weeks of January, maybe ahead or after the public demonstration of PLTR.

We are in a game where we push up the value of companies so they clear multiple market cap and liquidity hurdles to be included in various ETFs/indexes, these then create a base level of support, such as with NIO and TESLA, the ultimate of which is inclusion in the S&P500, then really there is not much to the game left. This is why i recommend you sell your TSLA and get into PLTR, because the game is only getting started with PLTR. In the meanwhile we have to contend with various antics of MM who are trying to make sure options expire worthless, which drive interim moves.

If you can't handle the volatility, just buy shares. If you are playing options, be very aware of option expiry dates, gamma positioning through max pain.

**Edit 1: Getting a lot of comments on insider selling post lock-up. It is absolute bullshit. I know you guys can't read, but its literally right in the S-1**

https://preview.redd.it/1u34w149jv661.png?width=1165&format=png&auto=webp&s=68ba8763bffc5616f80e2e981d703a03ec95bd4a

60%+ of the company is owned by Thiel, Karp, Cohen, and SOMPO (A Japanese Strategic who has a JV with Palantir in Japan), none of whom will sell major stakes in the company any time soon.

Out of the cap table about 20% is held by VCs which may need to liquidate due to fund life terms. Half of that is probably going out next year as they appear to be cross fund investments by all these VCs, the earlier vintage funds will have liquidation pressures while the later funds can wait. So maybe half these shares need to be sold in 2021 post lock-up.

Employee option is peanuts. The only thing being sold post lock-up is 10% by the three VCs (Foundrs Fund/Thiel, 8VC and DTS. That is nowhere close to 1 billion shares, it’s closer to 250 million shares or about 4 days trading volume, which is no big deal. They will be exiting that 10% over likely the course of 6 month/1 year, it won't even make a dent in the market liquidity. ",2020-12-22 17:30:52

Why I think OPEN may be the next PLTR🚀🚀🚀,0.42,"I just bought some stock and call options for January 15. Any opinions?

-With the house market being hot and Covid on the rise with possibly a new Covid strain (UK), I feel companies adapting and providing services that can be done virtually will boom. 

-Ark investments have been purchasing warrants before the merger and bought OPEN yesterday. Their weight is about 1.5% for one of their portfolios https://www.arktrack.com

-Currently, the stock is around $28-32. Zillow is about $145. I believe Opendoor’s business plan is better and more innovative for customers than going through Zillow, Redfin and other similar sites. 

-Some good google searches, I’ve found articles talking positive about the company and I believe this is a very good dip to get into just like PLTR before it shoots up in the coming days

Any more insight would be appreciated?",2020-12-22 17:18:06
NIO and PLTR dips 🚀 - get em while they’re hot,0.92,"Ahite retards, here’s my positions:

NIO 12/24 $44C, 24 shares (Just added 2)
PLTR 5/21 $15C, 80 shares (Just added 10) 

Ok both these are taking a major dip, NIO at $47 and PLTR at $27.

Perfect time to buy. Said the same thing last week when I entered my $44 call, and when added like 20 shares of PLTR.

NIOs not going anywhere. Huge order numbers, PRC Green 2035 initiative, huge demand. Chinese are going to be proud to own Chinese brand that is as good as western.

PLTR... same... has chokehold on GOV and MIL Intel and IT systems. They’ve been at it for years. Special Forces were using PLTR when regular army was stuck with shitty DCGS shit, everyone wants PLTR now, and once they have it they will not go back to overpriced garbage. 

Anyways, neither of those fundamentals are going to change. Look for yourself for the bottom of the dip...IMO already happened and heading back up.

It doesn’t require any mental functionality to guess who that is as there is no other American country auto maker that sane people of the rest of the world are interested in. The investment case with NNO is that there is a real chance it being bought by Papa Elon. Their cobalt-free cathodes are cheaper and provide increased performance what they‘ve already proved in the past. Right now the stock sits at around laughable 500 mio market cap. If this doesn’t convince you now checkout this DD: the ticker says NNO (even in uppercase!) but we know what to do. Only idiots would double inverse.,2020-12-22 14:09:55

The Registration Statement registered the resale of 257,135,415 shares of Class A common stock of the Company by the registered stockholders identified in the prospectus included in the Registration Statement. As disclosed in the Registration Statement, the Company intended to maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement for 90 days.

In accordance with an undertaking made by the Company in the Registration Statement to remove by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering, this Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 to the Registration Statement is being filed to terminate the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and to remove from registration all securities registered but not sold under the Registration Statement.",2020-12-22 04:40:35

PVGO and the reason that tsla shorts keep getting fucked,0.74,"Alright retards, time for class. put on your thinking caps. Im here to explain to you what PVGO is and how it affects stock prices. It is also why TSLA shorts have been getting reamed for the past year, why people are willing to pay $47/share for NIO, and why people pay anything for an unprofitable company like PLTR. You all probably know what it is in essence but don't know the name. So welcome to finance 101

**PVGO is an acronym for Present Value of Growth Opportunities**

Basically, it represents the component of a company’s stock value that corresponds to the investors’ expectations of growth in earnings. 

[PVGO picture for those who cant read](https://preview.redd.it/w0c6ocetnn661.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a6e116420a0ac8853d48b4274b8ef81845da30d)

In retard speak, PVGO represents the difference between what a company is **fundamentally worth** and what investors **think it should be fundamentally worth in the future.** 

&#x200B;

When it comes to companies like TSLA, everyone has seen the wonderful graph comparing TSLA market cap and cars sold compared to other auto makers. In fact, many think that TSLA is a bubble waiting to pop. The reason they're wrong is PVGO. 

* As long as investors believe in the future of tesla and think they will remain innovative and ambitious, the stock price will not crash hard like people are expecting. 

You can see PVGO in most stocks, from GameStop to Nio to PLTR. The one thing they have in common is that investors *expect* that they will grow, so they *pay for the value of that growth.*",2020-12-22 03:17:50

While everyone's talking about steel...,0.94,"First off, big round of applause to the Steel God u/VitoCorlene, and all his prophets delivering the good news to all the WSB autists. Let's be real, if he didn't pump steel with such conviction you all would probably be twiddling your thumbs like the retards you are while your weekly PLTR calls consistently fucks you unforgivingly. Now I know most of you here are probably: (1) balls deep in $MegaTendies (and its subsidiary plays); (2) bag holding GME until Melvin and those nerds get squozed; or (3) losing money on $DASH puts and are probably refreshing this sub every 30 second with the *'New Posts'* filter as work begins to pile up at your shitty 9-5 work from home jobs.

Call me the new prophet on the block (or a retard) because you fuckers need to really consider $FCX as the next fucking boomer rocket that's going to lift off into Alpha Centauri and give you the tendies you degenerates don't want to miss out on.

&#x200B;

Read the scriptures below nerds:

&#x200B;

**What the fuck is FCX?**

Freeport-McMoran is one of the largest copper mining firms in the world, and one of the few that are American - operates large, long-lived, geographically diverse assets with significant proven and probable reserves of copper, gold and molybdenum. According to their latest earnings, they generated copper and gold sales 7% above their July estimates. They've reduced their net debt YOY and has been able to maintain a strong and healthy balance sheet over the course of this pandemic.

**Copper**

After a small decline of 0.2% in 2019, world copper mine production, adjusted for historical disruption factors, is expected to decline by about 1.5% in 2020 and then to recover by around 4.5% in 2021:

Copper prices are currently at an all time high (look at chart below) and demand for copper will pick up significantly into 2021 as economies start to recover. Like steel, this is a no brainer cyclical economic crash play, and people will always fucking need copper.

https://preview.redd.it/91u0up2ntk661.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9ed529e67a3c56655ba6c3da2f521da6166e82b

**70% of the world's copper is used in applications that deliver electricity**

* Electric Vehicles (EVs), charging stations, high efficiency motors use roughly **4x more copper** than traditional automobiles
   * We know the EV hype is there and coming into fruition with countries committing to be climate neutral by 20\_\_, there will be even more demand for copper as production ramps up
* Solar panels and associated hardware use copper vs. the traditional fossil fuel power generators
* 5G higher frequency spectrum requires more than 10x the hardware of 4g and there's plenty of associated copper cabling

**Copper supply takes a long time to ramp up (i.e. getting mines approved, excavation, etc)**  and FCX is in the midst of massively ramping its biggest mine which will roughly double output next year.

Copper is used in building construction, power generation and transmission, electronic product manufacturing, and the production of industrial machinery and transportation vehicles. Copper is an essential component in the motors, wiring, radiators, connectors, brakes, and bearings used in cars and trucks.

&#x200B;

**FCX OUTLOOK 2021**

**Volume Growth (2021e v. 2020e)** = Copper 20%+, Gold 70%+ 🚀🚀🚀

**Expanding Margins =** EBITDA/Cash Flows to approximately double in 2021e compared to 2020e  🚀🚀🚀

**Near-term: Laser Focused on Execution** = Continued net debt reduction 🚀🚀🚀🚀

**Sustained growth** in copper demand is expected to continue as **copper is essential to economic activity** and even more so to the modern technological society. Infrastructure development in major countries such as **China and India** and the **global trend towards cleaner energy** will continue to support copper demand. 🚀🚀🚀

Everyone has it wrong. This is what $PLTR ACTUALLY does and why it's valuable.,0.92,"So I had a long conversation with my friend who works in the AI space about Palantir and how you could begin to value their technology. I'll try to keep it concise and simple, but TL:DR; buy 2023 calls right now. Any strike, at any price.

1. Everyone and the financial media has it wrong. If you are reading an analysis, article, or price target revision, and they call it a ""Data Analytics Company"", you can ignore it entirely.

2. The real value of the company is basically in creating models for algorithms. The model is basically a piece of code that can be implemented into an application. It's essentially the algorithm. A model/algorithm is created by giving it a goal, and inputting a set of data the AI can use to get to the goal more efficiently. 

3. By basically creating an intuitive, easy to use software that Data Engineers can use to create models, they are eliminating the need to build one from scratch. This is a huge efficiency for companies that want to use AI and algorithms to improve their business, software or application. It means that instead of hiring an entire team of Data Engineers, you only need to hire one or two.

If you are having a hard time getting your head around this, here is an analogy:

Say you are a new company that wants to sell tendies online. Are you going to hire a team of developers to code and build a website and entire e-commerce platform from scratch? No. You are going to hire one person, who has a more diversified set of talents, to manage a Shopify site and Shopify template.

This is why Shopify is valuable.

Now, consider the following scenario:

Let's pretend Spotify doesn't exist yet and that you want to create a music streaming service that generates recommendations that increase listening time by using an algorithm. Are you going to hire an entire team of Data Engineers to figure out how to use a massive set of user data to develop a model, or are you going to just use Palantir, and maybe even contract one of their Data Engineers to do it for you, without paying anybody a salary?

Look up the salary of one Data Engineer.

That's why Palantir is valuable. They can benefit anybody who wants to implement AI/algorithms into their software or applications, without the massive investment of hiring Data Engineers to create it from scratch. For years, this has been the ""edge"" of companies like Google and Amazon, who are at the forefront of AI. Palantir is democratizing this ""edge"".

I will not be responding to comments from people here saying this is incorrect, because you are all retards and I understand this is a gross simplification. It's also, of course, not the only thing Palantir does. But, I think it is the most scalable in the short-term.",2020-12-21 17:12:57
Blowing my stimmy check on PLTR shares like,0.97,,2020-12-21 17:02:19
"CLDR - The Other, Massively Undervalued PLTR",0.79,"Long time lurker and I’m finally deciding it's time to show you retards the biggest missed opportunity of any IPO in the past 5 years.

I know that PLTR is going to the moon, and these past couple weeks have been super frustrating as it seems to currently be refueling for a run up. But while you wait for your pockets to return to tendie town, might be worth checking out a company that does basically **\*the exact same thing\*** that is currently valued at 10x less than PLTR.

Full disclosure - I used to work at Cloudera and was there when they IPO’d in 2017 - the same day as CVNA. At the time, Cloudera was one of the biggest unicorns in Silicon Valley as they had billions in funding from some pretty notable VCs and a hefty amount from Intel.  After a super disappointing IPO, I sold off every share I owned over the next year as companies like Carvana soared. At the time I was convinced that nobody would ever understand the complicated software that Cloudera built and sold, and despite solid growth, lots of enterprise customers, and a road to profitability, it just kind of… fell flat.

That is, until WSB took over the world. Fast forward to 2020 and a PLTR IPO that grew massively over the next several months - I was completely shocked. Yes, I know you’re all retarded but I didn’t know you were \*that\* retarded that you would give PLTR, a company founded 5 years before CLDR with only 20% higher revenue and lower margins, a 10x higher valuation (\~$50 billion market cap for PLTR vs \~$4 billion for CLDR). I have former colleagues that worked with me at CLDR and who now work at PLTR and they think it’s complete insanity that PLTR has a valuation that much higher than CLDR. If you all fundamentally believe that PLTR is worth more than $40 billion, then you are missing a huge opportunity with CLDR.

Cloudera and Palantir use basically the same exact underlying software components to build fundamentally the same exact solutions for their customers. Don't believe me? Go look at the [CLDR](https://github.com/cloudera) and [PLTR](https://github.com/palantir?page=1) Github repos and look for terms like ""hadoop"", ""spark"", ""parquet"", etc. Yes, there are some differences in their product but they are more the same than they are different - at the end of the day the biggest thing each of these companies do is data integration and analytics. However, their approaches, technology influence, and sales methodology should yield a similar or better valuation for CLDR than PLTR for a number of reasons:

* Though PLTR has higher quarterly revenues, CLDR has much better [gross profit margins](https://ycharts.com/companies/CLDR/gross_profit_margin) (81% most recently and increasing vs 63% for PLTR), likely due to their revenue mix being more heavily weighted in software subscriptions vs services. For the latest quarter, [CLDR had 91% of revenue from subscription software sales](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001535379/ec48b119-7c21-4fa4-a3fa-2e3bf020c6fb.pdf) and 8% from services, while PLTR doesn’t seem to break this out in their 10-Q. CLDR subscription software margins are 87% as of last quarter. [PLTR has a 3.5x higher cost of revenue](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001321655/8a404f13-53a8-4610-9f9a-34add0ec1742.pdf) which all but confirms that their mix is much more heavily weighted towards services with 10-20% margin vs subscription software that has 80%+ margin.
* CLDR reported an EPS of  .15 for the [most recent quarter](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CLDR/analysis?p=CLDR), which was a beat of almost 67%. While PLTR reported an EPS of .09 for the most recent quarter, GAAP net loss is much worse (PLTR earnings were -$853M for last quarter and -$110M for the prior quarter, vs CLDR at -$14M and -$36M, respectively). Accounting for the effect on earnings of their recent IPO, PLTR is probably at least 3x less profitable than CLDR despite having been around for 5 years longer.
* As another reference point, FSLY is currently trading at a 3x higher market cap than CLDR on negative earnings with a 3x higher net loss and 3x lower revenue.
* Cloudera has surprised on earnings by at least 50% for each of the last 4 quarters, and should within the next 1 or 2 quarters no longer have a GAAP net loss, and their profitability should continue improving as they continue their pivot to [cloud-based SaaS solutions](https://www.cloudera.com/products/cloudera-data-platform.html). PLTR seems to be years away from achieving the same thing.
* CLDR has broader sales reach and a larger sales force - they have some government customers (e.g. [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.cloudera.com/about/customers/us-census-bureau.html))  but they [target traditional and high tech enterprises](https://www.cloudera.com/about/customers.html). I never competed even one time against PLTR when I sold CLDR software, which shows that they are much too focused on a particular vertical/industry and/or do not have traction in the broader market.
* CLDR has greater influence on the underlying technology stack that both PLTR and CLDR use (and AMZN/MSFT/GOOG clouds) because they contribute more code than any other company to the open source community that they all use. They also partner more heavily with big cloud service providers and technology providers (have [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/en/bigdata/big-data-appliance/5.1/bigli/cdh5.html#GUID-5B5969CD-FE64-46A2-A7BE-53AF6D11AE77)/[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/partners/cloudera) co-sell solutions, CLDR software works in all 3 major cloud providers and they have a SaaS solution that runs in all 3 cloud providers)
* CLDR has a [more broadly applicable suite of products](https://www.cloudera.com/products.html), as it can fit in the data warehouse/analytics space, the machine learning space, and the data processing space. It competes with other well-known software like traditional data warehouses (Oracle, IBM, Teradata), cloud native warehouses (Snowflake software, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift), and data science and machine learning unicorns like Databricks. Because of this, it has broad applicability vs PLTR who seems to target very specific use cases.
* Given its cross-cloud compatibility and influence on the open source technology ecosystem, they would be ripe for an acquisition by a traditional enterprise software company who is trying to gain more cloud traction - for example an IBM or an Oracle. I would not be surprised to see them gobbled up in the next year or two. CLDR has a large growth SaaS solution that [grew 40% in the last quarter](https://investors.cloudera.com/news-and-events/news/press-release-details/2020/Cloudera-Reports-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx) that would be a good buy for any of these old guard companies.
* Both PLTR and CLDR have an 'L' as the second character in the ticker and an 'R' as the fourth character in the ticker which makes them easily interchangeable in any already existing shitposts or memes you've worked on
* CLDR offers a lot of opportunity for cloud and weather-related puns and usage of cloud emojis, which WSB desperately needs more of.

For these reasons and more, I fundamentally believe that CLDR is massively under valued at a $4 billion market cap/$12.68/share and represents a great buying opportunity, especially if you are in the camp that thinks that PLTR should shoot through $30/share, to a $50 billion valuation and to the moon. I mean, SNOW has an absolutely retarded $200 billion market cap. There is no way that CLDR should be valued 10x less than PLTR and 50x less than SNOW.

Positions: GOOG (100 shares, long), SNOW 320c 12/24, CLDR 05/21/21, 20c

**TL;DR** **- If you believe in PLTR,  CLDR makes basically the same products, has a 10x lower market cap, is more profitable, and is worth a serious look as both a solid investment and as a potential acquisition target. Even if you believe it to be half as valuable as PLTR, that's 40$ upside on shares currently standing at 12$ a share.**

Palantir's Profitability 2021,0.95,"Dear Fellow Autists of WSB, 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I will probably be wrong in my speculation of amount of quarterly revenue needed to become profitable and I will probably be wrong in the value of the army contract. Reason why I set the flair as discussion. However, if you go through some of the sources I linked you might get similar numbers. 

Back on November 18th it was announced that Palantir🚀 was awarded one of two US army prototype contracts for capability set 23. Capability set 23 had 140 applications across 6 topics and was conducted as a ""shark tank"" style technical demonstration. For Palantir's🚀 topic I don't know how many competitors they had but they beat them and got one of two prototype contracts for network modernization.

We know that Palantir🚀 will achieve profitability soon. Accounting for the massive stock based compensation we had in Q3 and changing that back to the norm + projected increases in expenses for Q4, Palantir🚀 needs an estimated greater than +35.6M in revenue this upcoming quarter in order to turn profitable with at a 51% profit margin. The new 44M 3 year FDA contract already should account for 3.6M leaving us with \~32M (10% closer to profitability!!). Hopefully I am not too far off with my estimates. [PLTR Q3 Earnings](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx#:~:text=(NYSE%3A%20PLTR)%20reported%20its,the%20third%20quarter%20of%202020.&text=Our%20growth%20and%20momentum%20across,generated%20%24190.5%20million%20in%20revenue)

No value was given for the US Army Capability set 23 contract but from the budget listings and allocations to the capability set we can get a rough estimate as to how important this contract could be.

Going off of slide 14 from a US army budget presentation we see an interesting new item pertaining to a budget request for the 2021 year ""software and digital technology"":

[Source: https:\/\/www.asafm.army.mil\/Portals\/72\/Documents\/BudgetMaterial\/2021\/pbr\/Overview&#37;20and&#37;20Highlights\/Army\_FY\_2021\_Budget\_Overview.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/wm5lnm05fd661.png?width=563&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b263288b81f2609622fe656b9829d1d2ae5d5b6)

Or you could try playing around with some of the numbers on slide 14 from the source above; 4% allocation for intelligence x size of budget for each topic.

If my speculation is correct then in Q4 ER we have +25M (100M for the full year) putting us only at -7M away from profitability for the upcoming quarter! Meaning any new contracts whatsoever will send this past the moon🚀🚀🚀. Or I could just be really retarded and wasted a few hours of my day.

Position: Long 17,000 shares @ 14.85. Picking up more next year after I sort out taxes.

Note:

It is getting more expensive to short with shares to sell short running very low. Credit Suisse (who doesn't have a position) and Morgan Stanley both downgraded this to the lowest rating and can't go lower. They blew their load and can't do much more. Citron is distracted by DASH or other short targets and have probably given up on PLTR. 🐻 thesis is probably you just regurgitating what institutions fed them ""valuations are too high.""  Current institutional holding is at \~12.5% and they will keep saying ""valuations are too high"" until they have enough exposure (see Credit Suisse for details).  🐻's should just hop on this 🚀 I know they want to.",2020-12-20 17:26:49

Typically when there is a breakout it always backtests the pattern, and that retouch will be your entry. I like $PLTR but we need news in order take off, right now the CEO is failing you as a person. He is a fucking dick. You should wish him the worse because when your calls are dying he is out there partying, not giving a shit.

I try to aim for high reward, low risk entries on stocks that have some sort of solid growth fundamental backdrop. That means either high growth rate in their sales, or high growth rate in sales AND EPS.

"PLTR catalyst overview: Palantir is entering a new phase of public relations, selling, and growth.",0.96,"Historically ultra secretive, Palantir is adapting to a culture of press and selling.

Catalysts to look forward to:

&#x200B;

**Jan 7th**:

Alex Karp has a Palantir Covid-19 special event with Washington Post columnist David Ignatius.

>At the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. data analytics company Palantir Technologies was tapped by over a dozen governments around the world including the U.S. government to use its software to manage the data about the spread of COVID-19, analyze trends and anticipate various needs across the supply chain. Alexander Karp is CEO and one of several co-founders of Palantir. On Thursday, Jan. 7 at 10:00 a.m. ET, Karp will join Washington Post columnist David Ignatius to talk about the challenges faced by governments around the world in relying on technology and software to respond to the pandemic.

&#x200B;

**Jan 26th**:

Palantir's first ever Demo Day!

>Join us to see our platforms in action and hear about our product development roadmap.

Register at [https://palantir.events/livedemoday](https://palantir.events/livedemoday)

&#x200B;

**Feb/March**:

Palantir expected to report 2020 full year earnings. Will top $1B in revenue. Possible surprise profit. If the Q3 earnings report is a guide, expect lots of client success stories and Covid-19 mixed in with financial results.

Did you miss Q3? Download the presentation at [https://investors.palantir.com/home/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/home/default.aspx) (I'm not direct linking the PDF because the url is a 3rd party; it is available from that official source)

&#x200B;

**New commercial contract announcements**:

3rd party job boards suggest hiring related to new commercial clients. Growth in the commercial space is rocket fuel. As commercial clients grow, institutional investors will recognize Palantir as an enterprise software company. Coverage at [https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/keu3ca/pltr\_will\_moon\_soon\_i\_got\_proof/](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/keu3ca/pltr_will_moon_soon_i_got_proof/)

&#x200B;

**New Government contract announcements**:

Palantir is helping State and International Governments manage their Covid-19 response. This includes outbreak detection, medical supplies production, hospital capacity, PPE distribution, vaccine development and distribution, contract tracing, and more.

This often represents the first time those Governments have seen Palantir in action. Having now experienced the speed and capabilities of Palantir's software, these Governments will likely seek additional Palantir partnerships. This real-world, global demo represents exponential contract growth potential.

&#x200B;

**Even more new Government contract announcements**:

SolarWinds hack + ""cyber security agenda"" of incoming US Government = Palantir opportunity. Palantir has intrusion detection, monitoring, and best practices products ready to deploy. Palantir's Cyber solution can be added on top of competitor products for layered security.

&#x200B;

**Palantir 101**:

Palantir has launched a Medium which features success stories, tech examples, and the ""Palantir Explained"" series which breaks down what Palantir does. Follow along at [https://medium.com/palantir](https://medium.com/palantir)

&#x200B;

**EDIT:**

&#x200B;

**When does the share lockup end?**:

Around \~1.85B additional shares of Palantir will become available once the share lockup ends. This is expected around mid-Feb to mid-March. Specifically, on the ""third trading day following the date of public disclosure of our financial results for the year ending December 31, 2020.""  


How will that impact the share price? Hard to say. Palantir will probably make the earnings report a banger ahead of the pending lockup. The market understands Palantir better by the day. Institutional buyers may be waiting to consume the additional supply.

Insiders who sold early have missed out on billions in gains.

&#x200B;

**""Possible surprise profit"" follow-up**:

A Q4 profit is unexpected, but the potential for a surprise exists. From the Q3 earnings:

>We incurred a loss from operations of $847.8 million, which includes $847.0 million in stock-based compensation following our recent direct listing.  
>  
>Our income from operations was $73.1 million when adjusting for $847.0 million in stock-based compensation, $20.2 million in related employer payroll taxes, and $53.7 million in expenses related to the listing.

and:

>... in connection with the Direct Listing, we incurred $769.5 million and $8.4 million of stock-based compensation using the accelerated attribution ...

The Q3 operations loss was blown up by listing expenses and sped up stock-based comp. IF Palantir is signing more contracts than forecast and stock-based comp is restrained, then we might get a headline surprise.

&#x200B;

u/Trance2000 **points out the security clearance**:

>Palantir offers a similar service \[to SolarWinds\] but their software is built for the highest level of US government clearance.

Palantir's existing ""located Osama bin Laden"" level of US government security clearance means they are positioned for instant deployment related to new US cyber security efforts. 

Why vett and on-board a young competitor when you can just call Palantir?

&#x200B;

u/25143 **explains the upside**:

>The growth potential for sifting through BIG DATA is nearly limitless. That's what Palantir does. Now you know. Quite amazing if you ask me. They are more than an infrastructure company like Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure. They provide real insight for nearly every single company in existence that has been data hording for decades.

Money Moves 101: CRM,0.76,"
I know a lot of us don’t like money from the way we been betting on a stock with almost 6% losses on the daily(PLTR). I know that hurt but so did those losses 👀

But let’s move to the real money play. SALESFORCE!
This is an easy one. Now let’s talk about the fundamentals,
Past 3 earnings exceeded
And history says March earnings will also exceed.
We can buy now 20% under its previous ATH and now it’s technically larger with the acquisition of WORK. “Yeah but they overpaid”.... tell it to someone who cares. Only thing I’m gone be worried about is why the markets were red Past 2 days  and CRM ended green on both days. Consolidation is happening now. Don’t miss the buss again

Side note- they tracking the distribution of COVID vaccines. Government contracts soon?! Maybe... maybe not. Maybe who cares

Edit cause bears gotta be 🌈: 

Lockup will have 3 days after their Q4 earnings release probably sometime in Feb2021 the number of outstanding shares to be traded will go from .5b to about 1.7b. This might seem bad but if you are concerned you just need to look at snowflake's recent lockup expiration to get an idea of what might happen.

Snowflake had a partial lockup release earlier this week and their float went from 32.2M to a total of 110.6M overnight. This is roughly a 3.4x increase in float volume. PLTR is going from \~.5B to \~1.7B float (a 3.4x increase in float). When the lockup expired for SNOW their SP dropped by \~15% and it is now recovering. So we can expect a \~15% drop once this lockup is done.",2020-12-18 22:02:39

I'm a three year vet at wall street bets I have 0ed my account twice, watched it go to -90% a couple more times.

I will now march again into the darkness to be victorious and make it to tendy town or be slaughtered by the the thousands.

Fundamentals 
Unemployment numbers 
885,000 total vs 808,000 expected
unemployment is simply bad no more needs to be said.

Consumer spending power is going down
Every state is seeing a decline in personal income. This will affect most companies and will lead to unimpressive Christmas sales.

The US dollar is weakening and will only continue on the next Stimulus 

The stimulus
Its underwhelming not sexy at all. Wheres my Trump bucks????????

Countries all over the world are reaching all time highs as their government desperately try to sell their bonds its simply not healthy. 

All the firms know this cannot last there has to be a pull back and when it does they will end richer than they were before. They hold this up by buying stocks. I do not know if they know options exist yet but I hope no one tells them they are doing it wrong.

Technical analysis
This Market has been gapping up in the am only to maintain and live off of the sweet power hour. Good luck finding support on the way down.

Cloud / Cyber Security - Splk,0.75,"Hello fellow Turds,

With the recent hack attack, boomers are now realizing importance of cyber security. It is a good time to place your bets on cloud/ cyber security providers. Now all of y'all are going to jump in tits up in pltr and obviously most of y'all will end up bag holders.

Popular candidate at least for silicon valley is Splunk- slpk. It is available at a bargain price right now. With a morning star fair value at 208, it is really a bargain for the cheap tards among you. 

Why so cheap you ask?

It fell after last earnings as some contracts which should have been in place 3rd quarter were postponed. These are already executed this quarter. So, outlook for next earnings looks good. Couple that with arriving stimulus/ vaccine and overall optimism on macro, y'all have a deal of life time.

Won't go into basics(you can read at any finance website or check analyst ratings) but company has good financials overall though might be over reinvesting. 

Now for the real wsbers: why can it achieve the retard strength and take you to tendieland? It doesn't have a very high market cap, initial price movement should come easier and the name of the company is Splunk ffs, it is meant to be a meme.

TLDR: Sell your house, buy SPLK",2020-12-18 15:32:16

Profiting off the hack of the decade - SUNBURST,0.98,"The Russians hacked everything and everyone in-the-know is shitting bricks.... [at least 40 high profile targets](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/), secret meetings in congress,  [senators tweeting scary things](https://twitter.com/SenBlumenthal/status/1338972186535727105), [emergency cyber directives](https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/21-01/), [demands to clean up, raise defenses and strike back](https://twitter.com/SenBlumenthal/status/1339585093170446342) are all leading to what is likely a bonanza of classified emergency funding authorizations across the US governments and top US and allied firms.  Shit is about to get real and as the details of this hack continue to be uncovered, money is gonna start flowing creating pandemic-level investing opportunities.. the question is.. where..

For that, it helps to understand the government's [process for responding to cybersecurity incidents](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf).  To save you some reading, the most relevant parts are:  1) Detect the attack 2) Contain the damage 3) Eradicate the attacker 4) Recover from the attack and Prepare to prevent the next one.    Each phase of this process is going to favor particular players.  Here is who:

**Detect and Contain**

$FEYE - These guys detected what the CIA, NSA, DHS and everyone else missed.  FireEye/Mandiant are THE company you bring in when you have a major breach and were the ones to discover that the Russians backdoor'ed SolarWinds software.  Simply put, they are the best in the world at Detect and Contain.  Their phone is now ringing off the hook with panicked companies and government agencies willing to pay nearly anything for them to find the well hidden hackers on their network.

**Eradicate and Recover**

These attackers are in so deep and are so stealthy, that fully eradicating the them is going to mean completely rebuilding massive computer networks.  When NotPetya was unleashed on the world, recovery cost FedEx $400 million and Maersk $300 million.  We could see similar levels of spend at some impacted entities.

$LDOS, $GD, $NOC, $BAH - [These guys are top government contractors](https://www.cyberscoop.com/six-big-vendors-dominate-a-fragmented-federal-cybersecurity-market-numbers-show/) that have skills in cyber defense, the feds are comfortable with them and have contract vehicles to quickly start throwing money their way.  As someone who responds to cybershit for a living, its hard to overstate the amount of work it will take to rebuild computer networks hit by this attack.  The government will need an army of contractors to surge remediation personnel and it will take months.

**Revenge**

[Biden is already promising retaliation](https://www.axios.com/biden-fireeye-solarwinds-hack-retaliation-1d9eac1e-a454-43cf-9241-10c05b2d7586.html) and for anyone that paid attention during the Snowden revelations, we know that $BAH is balls deep in with the NSA on the offensive side the house.  Surging offensive capacity is going to be a good thing for the folks at Booze.

**Never Again**

Detecting and defending against cyber attacks like this is f'ing hard.  Defenders need advanced training and technology. Autist favorite $PLTR is going to be a favorite here.   Not only does the government love them, their platform has a proven track record of uncovering hard to detect attacks like [ghosnet](https://www.palantir.com/wp-assets/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ImpactStudy_GhostNet.pdf) and Shadow Network.  Business is about to get really good at Palantir as government agencies like DOE, Treasury, DHS and others double-down on their software and services to put AI and ML detection technologies in place.  So... as y'all say  PLTR to the moon!!

TL/DR

This hack is a HUGE deal.  Congress is going to start dumping money.  That money is going to go to a handful of firms.  Buy $FEYE, $PLTR, $BAH, $LDOS and other government cybersecurity contractors.",2020-12-18 15:28:50

Why invest in Palantir? 360° tech firm that's gonna revolutionize every industry (amazing dd inside),0.92,"AUTOMOTIVE
Since 2017, Palantir has partnered with Scuderia Ferrari to integrate and analyze performance data in order to make faster, more data-driven decisions.
Throughout its lifetime, a vehicle generates a massive amount of data. From initial design to production and assembly, through marketing and sales, and eventually in use on the road, this data can provide valuable insight into quality, safety, and performance. But processing and integrating vehicle data takes time and effort that could otherwise be spent diagnosing complex problems.

SKYWISE
Skywise connects the aviation value chain in a secure ecosystem that’s transforming how the industry uses data.
Now, airlines can use massive-scale sensor data, maintenance systems, aircraft schedules, passenger bookings, and more in one environment. On top of this data asset, Skywise offers a diverse analytical suite for operators to make sense of that data in both code-free and code-based environments.

CYBER
With the uptick in high-profile data breaches, organizations with large networks are working hard to guard against advanced intruders who identify and exploit complex vulnerabilities on the most important systems. But often, a tunnel vision focus on sophisticated attacks distract organizations from more basic problems, like stale passwords or machines that haven't been patched against months-old vulnerabilities, that leave them just as vulnerable to attack.

FINANCIAL COMPLIANCE 
Financial institutions with complex portfolios and high volumes of trades and transactions are often buried under petabytes of data, incompatible systems, and complicated customer landscapes. As this data grows in size and complexity, so does the regulatory landscape, and traditional tools can't keep.

INSURANCE
Key players in insurance are using Palantir Foundry to optimize every stage of the value chain: from underwriting and pricing through to policy administration, claims handling, risk management, and reserving.

LAW ENFORCEMENT 
For federal and local law enforcement agencies, Palantir Law Enforcement equips officers and agents with the tools they need to easily analyze intelligence, securely collaborate on investigations, manage cases, produce reports, and respond to crime as it happens.

MANUFACTURING
The most critical challenges facing manufacturers throughout the value chain are, fundamentally, data challenges. Supply chain, procurement, quality control, efficiency, rapid troubleshooting, and demand forecasting depend on an accurate and up-to-date data landscape

PHARMA
Pharmaceutical companies need an accurate, detailed picture of patient experience and outcomes in both clinical trials and the real world to develop and deliver effective drugs. However, analyzing real-world data for differentiated biomedical insight requires dealing with tremendous scale and complexity, as well as potential privacy concerns. Claims data, for example, is on the order of billions of rows, and genomics data can contain thousands of features per patient.

CASE MANAGEMENT
Palantir Case Management provides a flexible solution for collaborative business process management. Users manage, investigate, and track cases without leaving the Palantir Gotham investigative platform, as well as add new information through simple data entry forms and export follow-on reports in configurable templates. With the full universe of data available in a unified environment, users rapidly build out and resolve case-based workflows.

DEFENSE
From strategy to operations to tactics, from reachback facilities to the tactical edge of the battlefield, Palantir Defense gives the warfighter immediate access to the latest critical information, removing the technical barriers to better data-driven decision making.

FACILITATE GDPR COMPLIANCE WITH PALANTIR FOUNDRY
Palantir Foundry provides the secure and accountable infrastructure that organizations need to maximize the value of their data while making sure that it's processed in accordance with the rules, regulations, and norms that govern data privacy

INTELLIGENCE
Palantir empowers intelligence agencies to securely derive actionable insights from sensitive data and achieve their most challenging operational objectives

LEGAL INTELLIGENCE
For legal professionals building complex cases, Palantir Legal Intelligence enables the discovery of patterns of behavior and links between key actors that lie hidden in vast amounts of structured and unstructured dataLawyers handle massive volumes of data from many sources. Many types of data that lawyers routinely encounter complicate traditional research methods.

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS
Mergers and acquisitions fundamentally change companies, their strategies, and their technology landscapes. Whether it's a one-time transaction or part of a broader M&A strategy, acquiring companies end up with fragmented systems that inhibit visibility into their newly unified organization's data. At the most critical juncture since their founding, companies are forced to prioritize systems decisions over business ones.

SALES AND REVENUE
Across industries, the competitive landscape changes quickly and organizations need to adapt faster than ever before. Delivering the right products and services requires granular insight into changes in customer behavior and dynamic ways to test and deploy new sales strategies.

Palantir's demo day confirmed for late January. Demonstrating Apollo, Foundry, and Gotham to billions around the globe - can you imagine the new orders and additional positive media boost for PLTR? Everyone will ACTUALLY be able to see PLTR's insane SKYNET tech in action - be prepared for Karp, Thiel, and PLTR to kick off with a BANG.

By going with a direct listing, PLTR didn't get the roadshow/marketing experience through the investment banks. This is their big splash. Do you think Thiel and Karp and are gonna get up there and lay an egg on their first big event? No, they are gonna kill it, and the stock price will MOON.

I'm sick of seeing all you dumbasses speculating on how hard it is to find the next TSLA in one thread and complaining about 'bag-holding' PLTR in another.

You retards have unwittingly bought into what the CEO has described will be the 'most important software in the world in a couple years' but are too ADD to sit on a stock for longer than a week.  The fucking DoD gave this company **[800 million dollars](https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/27/palantir-army-contract-dcgs-a/)** over a year ago and they've publicly stated they will never work with China (who by the way the US is about to engage in a tech / data arms race with if they aren't already). 

Gov't contracts aside, public companies are spending 10s of millions of dollars on this software and it's *saving them even more*.  They have essentially been in stealth mode developing their tech for the last 17 years to assure that they have no competition, and the revenue is about to pour in big time. 

Nobody understands this stock yet, and that's beautiful because it has potential to grow 10x in the next 5 years.

Those bags you're complaining about holding are filled with diamonds, institutional investors realized this too late and have been trying to fuck with the price in response.

If you want more in-depth DD, look at [this post by /u/colonel_cubical](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kdp6qr/the_general_public_still_doesnt_understand_pltr/)

C3.AI to the moon after options availability,0.54,"I tried to post yesterday a purchase I had made but it didn’t go through, yet I needed post today to share that it paid off:

My concern with new indexes like C3.AI and Airbnb was that of everyone, that they are/were over valued. However, following trends like other tech stocks that were newly available like PLTR to retail investors, these stocks shot up, slumped and start making the climb after options become available.

With Airbnb and AI, however, they had unique IPOs that could/would have had a different trend but as of this morning it seems it is doing  exactly as anticipated and I expect this to continue for 30-45 days like PLTR.

I can’t afford any more options on C3.AI or Airbnb but still hope for some hefty gains as I’m already up 30 percent. Those looking to buy in, wait until the afternoon when some of the volatility priced in cools off because I made the mistake of buying in at 9am for $15 calls yesterday instead of $12 and they’re currently at $18 and rising. Airbnb is similarly expensive

Concerns: overvaluation and IPO methods may create alternative trends as well as AI being a “boomer” stock. Also, $TSLA inclusion in the S&P500 May create a tech slump or even crash so that it might be better to wait till Monday or Tuesday next week to buy into this idea.

Positions: $AI 145c 4/16/21

TLDR: buy AI and/or Airbnb calls for 30-45 days out according to similar newly indexed tech stock trends",2020-12-16 17:01:48

PLTR - why you should give all your money to Peter Thiel,0.91,"Most of you already know who Peter Thiel is. He is the co-founder/chairman and largest shareholder in Palantir. Most of his networth is tied to PLTR. He is the head of the PayPal mafia and really people he has backed formed the back of Silicon Valley post google.

He loves to provoke controversy by paying kids to drop out of college to start businesses. He promotes seasteading and anti aging research. So why does this matter. Well his ventures funds are all usually 10x oversubscribed so yes it’s nearly impossible to invest into him even if you have billions of dollars. Yes you can throw billions of dollars at him and he won’t take your money. 

But by buying palantir you are literally replicating the same portfolio positioning as the smartest ventures capitalist in the world. The man who foresaw the rise of Facebook, the man who is best buds with Elon musk (backed Tesla and Space X, they actually both nearly died in a car accident in Elon’s Mclaren F1). This man does not fuck around (even if he does fuck other men).  

And on top of that his money is directly used to save the world from a mimetic apocalypse brought about by zero sum completion. The man is literally doing it out of Christian duty to save the world.

https://www.city-journal.org/peter-thiel

Look, if you don’t give this man more money we will all be living in some sort of dystopia, be it totalitarian AI, matrix, post nuclear war road warrior, factional sectarian violence ala reformations 2.0 or the purge where antifa and militias battle it out on the streets. The only way to hold the apocalypse at bay is to invest in a few genius level people who can change the world and create millions of jobs and the best way to do that is to give all your money to Peter Thiel.

TLDR: buy PLTR, make tendies, save the world",2020-12-16 11:37:18

PLTR was the golden egg that retail sniffed out before it could hatch,0.96,"1.86 billion fully diluted PLTR shares become unrestricted at the end of next month.

We should expect more price manipulation on this stock until institutions have their hands on these remaining shares at the price they want.      Big money hates Karp for going direct listing on PLTR and depriving them of their guaranteed ten bagger by IPOing this.  The fact that retail got in on the ground floor and started bringing the price up months early, before they could secure their billion shares, has forced them into overtly manipulating the shit out of the price with admin level control.

Morgan Stanley followed up on the Citron hit piece tweet by trying to induce panic by aggressively algo shorting their shares against market at all hours and they will continue to do so until those restricted shares become available for them to purchase, at a price they would prefer.

This is a multi-decadal shadowy Government big data and surveillance company with the most advanced inter-agency data analytics platform currently in use at every Federal department. Sticky customers with pockets that don't end.  Try to tell me a food delivery app is worth more.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** Street wanted an invite only house party and retail drunkenly found the venue before it started and started popping bottle with their friends.  Ease up on buying 10000 weekly OTM options until the lockup, you are only supporting the heavy price suppression.  Until then PLTR is a literal casino, in that the house always wins.  Doesn't mean you can't get lucky though. 

Buy shares and hold, don't stop loss them.  We tipped their hand and saw the cards.  This many whales gathering in the same body of water is no coincidence.",2020-12-16 04:57:44

PLTR - Technical Analysis from a Professional Investor - Update 12/15,0.93,"So I did an update a week ago telling you why PLTR at 25 was likely the bottom. I also told you to get the hell out of the 12/11-12/18 options as those would expire worthless.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k98p6h/pltr\_technical\_analysis\_from\_a\_professional/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k98p6h/pltr_technical_analysis_from_a_professional/)

now I will go over how to trade the stock in the next couple of weeks. I am cutting down the number of words I am writing because it has come to my attention from comments in my previous posts that a lot of you guys can't read. So I am going to keep it even more basic.

We are now approaching where TSLA and NIO were after their first initial rally, correction and consolidation before the second leg rally which then forms the symmetrical triangle.

https://preview.redd.it/yzim1gl5ke561.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e35a306b95241794ff00e6c69b14e6285bae886

Again, this was the same chart for Tesla for the first phase of the run-up and transition to the second run-up. The slight skew of the triangle doesn't matter, what matters is you see a narrowing of the band before the upward movement.

https://preview.redd.it/obkgayjake561.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=71c53d79f93f758ee43d8b46c61646088f1f7293

Now we look at option pricing. Option deltas  are the most attractive that I have seen on PLTR for almost 1+ month now. These tell me that there are very few buyers of call options at this point and we are in a lull before periods of significant more option buying.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v2btc0pyje561.png?width=701&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e01729545a596866a3b062935bee7d25f6ebe41

We are about to start the explosive second run phase of Palantir and my target still mid to low 40s by end of the year/early next year.  Again, don't be surprised if we still dip down to around 23. But the downside is largely done. This is of course assuming we don't get a massive stock market crash for which I have small amounts of hedges on VIX calls that are rolling on a monthly basis.

https://preview.redd.it/1orczd5xje561.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef76cf4df7324f0779a1949f980dd78d29f2f150

TLR: go long PLTR now, risk reward is quite favorable. 23 is the lowest it can probably go in the short term. You are already seeing doubters on PLTR on WSB. This means from a psychological stand-point, most would be sellers are already gone. The market is now open widely to incremental buyers. I bought some 12/24 calls at the 30 strike and added more to my 5/21 50 strike.

"The general public still doesn't understand PLTR, the party is just getting started",0.95,"So today I was strolling around the internet and saw [this article](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/palantir-stock-strategy-savvy-political-headwinds/) that got me worked up when the author goes "" Sure, Palantir is a right-wing oriented company"". First off, CEO and meme-god Alex Karp holds the opposite views of Thiel (which google easily confirms). More importantly, it only confirms that the general public has no idea what PLTR truly does or how powerful the software is. **So today, I am going to take you all on an adventure and get you as close to the super scary stuff PLTR does so you can get a taste of their work. TL;DR at the bottom just make sure you look at the pictures.**

The images you are about to see come from a private think tank type business in DC that uses PLTR for their analysis of questionable activities around the globe. I linked the full reports and pulled out the best images. This data is all Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) from a variety of sources that PLTR turned from disparate data to powerful graphic with a story. The data itself comes from different countries databases including shipping registries, business registrations, transaction data, and many other country level sources. On its own, the data is useless, however, with PLTR you get complex network analysis that gives you answers to questions you didn't ask yet.

One separate thought, PLTR has been actively making the shift to a SaaS company for years. PLTR has been outsourcing the low margin government contract work (help desks, IT support, FSRs, and other functions). They have [preferred partners](https://www.palantir.com/partnerships/preferred-partners/) who do all the difficult inside of government work so PLTR can focus on being a SaaS company not a consulting company.

**Conclusion:** All of the information in those reports came from OSINT, imagine what the real version the USG uses can do. Adapt that power to the private sector and how PLTR could be used to harness data and make companies more efficient and profitable. This is basically the SkyNet prototype

**TL;DR: Former PLTR user believes PLTR's tech is still massively misunderstood and will go to the Moon. At least go back and look at the pictures if you don't like words. As WSB turns bearish on PLTR, you know its time to buy more.**

Identifying ROADBLOCKS to getting IPO Options Tendies,1.0,"Hey team, some quick helpful tips on how to do options when a stock IPOs, and a couple of FAQs that come up from time to time:

1: When a stock IPOs, there's no options for at least three (3) business days. The CBOE (Chicago Board Options Exchange) do this because they want to make sure the stock price has kind of stabilized and they can have an idea of how to price the options (figuring out how all those Greeks are going to go).

2: When options first open, it's like the fucking beaches of Normandy on D-Day. You've seen the movies.  Be real careful. The doors to the landing crafts open, and the first round of autists pile onto the beach with their ridiculous shitcalls, only to get torn to shreds in a hail of gunfire. That's the opening scene of your Tendie Termination. Low Open Interest means the market hasn't figured out how to price the options yet (least of all you), so the Bid/Ask spreads are gaped out worse than when that Chad of a boyfriend is done with your wife. You'll cross B/A spreads that make up 25-50% of the value of the option - meaning you might need to double your value just to break even. It's a rough scene.

3: Market makers like round numbers, which makes higher open interest and closer B/A spreads - you save money on a more mature market. For example, look at PLTR May 21 '21 $30c vs. the $31c: The $30c have a B/A spread of $6.10 to $6.45 - a 35 cent spread (about 5%) - by comparison, the $31c have a spread of 5.50 to 6.55 - a $1.05 spread (or\~16%!). The $31 may look cheaper, but in reality you're getting a shittier deal of crossing that massive B/A.

4: OTM Call Options typically don't go higher than either 50% or 100% of the underlying stock's highest value. I've written letters to CBOE begging and pleading for more, and they won't do it. Look at Tesla - it's ATH was $654, and the highest its options can go is $1200 (at least until Daddy Elon Tweets a pic of him and Alex Karp docking together and moons both stocks to $6969.420).

TL;DR: Don't pile into the IPO unless you're terminally ill and hate your grandkids. Don't buy Options on the day they're first available. Buy round numbers to get a better bargain.

Positions: An irresponsibly large amount $SHLDQ options on the fourth business day of trading, probably in January by the look of it.

Weekly Update: What if you sold the most popular contracts on reddit expiring December 18th,0.87,"I have been analyzing comments and posts on reddit to determine what stocks are mentioned the most. This week I am looking at the options contracts that have been mentioned on the subreddits we track.  Specifically, I am looking at contracts expiring this Friday 12/18.    The data collected for this analysis was collected from 12/04 – 12/10.  For Friday’s expiration there are 448 contracts and 714 mentions of these contracts.  Quite an increase from last week which is pretty exciting.  Though, I mostly attribute this to improvements in the machine learning models we are using to identify stocks and contracts.  The most popular contracts this week are the PLTR 30 Call and the LAZR 30 Put.  

The goal here is to track what reddit is following and to see how reddit preforms.  There is this notion that retail investors often fail to beat the market. This is why financial advisors recommend that you buy into the major ETF’s such as SPY.  As historically there have been few people that manage to beat the major Index’s year over year.  My hypothesis going into this week is that I should bet against the trends on reddit as typically the retail investor is wrong.  

As of week 1, I would have profited $1710 betting against reddit [Last Weeks Recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditTickers/comments/kbcc6x/weekly_results_what_if_you_sold_the_most_popular/).  I will continue to track my progress each week. 

I just want to emphasize it does not matter if I am right or wrong.  More importantly this research is to identify if there are any trends worth following. 

Call Data

* Out of the 448 contracts 356 are calls (80% Long)  
* 70.8% of the calls are out of the money
* The out of the money Calls are an average of 23% out of the money. 
* The in the money calls are an average of 26% in the money. 

Put Data

* Out of 448 Contracts 92 are puts
* 67.4% of the puts are out of the money
* The out of the money puts are an average of 18.7% out of the money
* The in the money puts are an average of 22% in the money 

On both the call and put sides the out of the money contracts are an average of 20%+ out of the money.  I am not that surprised as there is a lot of yolo culture on reddit.  It is surprising to see the number of contracts that are out of the money in general.  Out of the 448 contracts only 134 are in the money as of last Friday’s close. 

The most popular calls that are in the money are: 

* PLTR 20, 22, 26 
* TSLA 600 
 

The most popular puts that are in the money are: 

* LAZR 30
* CRSR 35.  

The most popular calls that are out of the money are 

* PLTR 30, 32, 35 
* TSLA 630, 650, 700
* ARKG 100
* NIO 50 
* SPY 380

The most popular puts that are out of the money are:

* LAZR 25, 20
* SPY 350
* PLTR 25, 26
* SNOW 330

My hypothesis is that the majority of these contracts will be losers.  Based on the data I would be looking to sell the PLTR 32 and TSLA 630 calls and LAZR 20 / 25 Puts. I will update with the premium prices first thing tomorrow morning at market open.",2020-12-14 01:31:32

PLTR - True and Simple DD,0.95,"Open your calculator and prepare to multiple and divide like the towering intellects you are.  I have boring math that will give you a surge in your portfolio.  

If PLTR makes $0.09 a quarter (like last quarter) for the next three quarters, its EPS will be $0.36 - a forward PE of 77.  

But wait, they are growing like weeds and publicly signing millions.  So lets go out wild and say they earn $0.01 per share more per quarter going forward.  So its $0.09, $0.10, $0.11 and $0.12 - EPS of $0.42.  Suddenly it has a forward PE of 66.

Compared to the other growth names, forward PE doesn't sound bad at all as they continue to grow.  I see them at 55 at end of 2021 and 85 at end of 2022.  At end of 2023, beats 100.

Palantir Saved This Dog,0.97,"I'm posting on the weekend so hopefully the mods let me show you all my appreciation.

A little over a month and a half ago I saw a rocket ship.  
I climbed aboard with my fellow autists and bought Calls without doing any research at all.  
I didn't even know the actual name of the company.  
I only knew, ""PLTR is going to the Moon!""  
I bought a fist full of calls and strapped in.

This last Tuesday, my dog was faced with a difficult emergency surgery.  
I had to find $6,200 with less than a weeks notice or he would face losing his eye or possibly his life.  
A deep and sincere thanks to all of my fellow autists and PLTR.  
I let go of a couple 1/15 $19 Calls to make it happen.  
He is alive and well with both eyes. (Extremely poor sight on the right eye.)

I really can't thank all of my fellow retards enough for saving my dog.  
Added pics of him as per the mandatory Dog Picture Tax.

‘Twas the Night Before Witchmas,0.93,"‘Twas the night before Witchmas and all through the sub
Not an autist was stirring, no 🌈🐻 hubbub
The short dated calls were bought up with care
In hopes that St. Jerome soon would be there

The bulls were nestled all snug in their beds
While visions of lambos danced in their heads
And Tim Apple in his kerchief and Bezos in his cap
Had just settled down for a long winter's nap

When out on Wall Street there arose such a clatter
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter
Away to the trading app I flew like a flash
Dumped all my money into ABNB and DASH

To the moon on the breast of the new-fallen SNOW
Gave the lustre of mid-day to all IPOs
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear
But a miniature fund of eight stonks I hold dear

With a little old driver, who calls the Fed “home”
I knew in a moment it must be St. Jerome
More rapid than eagles his printing it came
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:

“Now, TSLA! now, SPCE! now, TQQQ and PLTR!
On, MU! on SPACs! on, NIO and SQ!
To the top of the charts! till you’re the talk of the Wall!
Now 🌕 away! Moon away! Moon away all!""

As WSB memes that before they inevitably die
When they meet with any news, 🚀 to the sky
So up to the top-movers the stonks they flew
With the sleigh full of tendies, and St. Jerome too

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the news
Rates would never be higher, till at least ‘22
As I drew in some crayons, account turning around
Down the chimney St. Jerome came with a bound

He was dressed all in Hermès, from his head to his foot
It was apparent the man had never purchased a put
The entire global markets he had flung on his back
And he looked like he could out-print any attack

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work
And filled all the accounts; then turned with a smirk
And laying his finger aside of his nose
And giving a nod, up the elevator stocks rose

He sprang to his printer, to his team gave a whistle
And out money flew like it was shot from a missile
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,
HAPPY WITCHMAS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOOD-NIGHT!

TLDR it’s quad witching, but obviously buy calls

Introducing WSB Roulette! Randomly generated options plays because this is a casino!,0.98,"**Intro**

I'd like to present my latest waste of time, WSB Roulette! Since logic no longer applies with trading in 2020, why not let RNGesus help? This is a quick python script I put together that takes a list of tickers and generates some random options to help you lose your money without guilt. If you lose money with these trades, you can blame RNG instead of yourself! If you're feeling even more adventurous, there's an FD mode too!

**DISCLAIMER**

This script is purely for entertainment purposes and I will be not responsible for any losses your retarded plays get you!!


**How it works**  
More details available in the README in the Github repo, but here's the gist of it. You feed it a list of tickers you want to ""invest"" in. For each one, it randomly decides whether to make a call/put, selects a random expiration date and strike price and returns the relevant data. The script uses a library that uses the Yahoo Finance API for data which is limited to 1000 API calls per hour per IP address.

Activating FD mode restricts the returned options to those that are <2 weeks and 3-5 strikes OTM only. Otherwise by default, you have a chance of OTM, ATM, and ITM  options.

**Setup and Usage**  
You'll need Python 3.6+ installed. Download requirements.txt and wsbroulette.py from the Github repo. Open a command prompt, navigate to the directory you downloaded the files and install the requirements using

    pip install -r requirements.txt    

Script Usage:

    python wsbroulette.py -t TICKERS -b BALANCE [-e EXPIRATION RANGE] [-s STRIKE_RANGE] [-d DISTRIBUTION] [-f] [-beargang] [-bullgang]

Enter the list of tickers in parantheses and seperated by commas. Ex. ""TSLA,GME,ROPE""

Balance is the maximum amount of $ you want to spend

EXPIRATION_RANGE is optional and controls what the maximum number of expiration dates are returned (Default = 4)

STRIKE_RANGE is optional and controls the range of strikes returned from the current underlying price (Default = 3)

DISTRIBUTION is optional and controls the randomness of allocation of funds between the tickers (Lower is more random, Higher is more even, Default = 10)

Add the -f flag if you want to engage FD mode! In FD mode, only the next 2 expiration dates are used. Options are also always OTM at 3-5 strikes out from underlying.

Add either the -beargang or -bullgang flag if you want to only generate puts or calls, respectively



**Example Usage**

    python wsbroulette.py -t ""TSLA,PLTR,GME,NIO"" -b 50000 -e 2 -s 5

This generates 4 options for TSLA, PLTR, GME, NIO with a total bankroll of up to $50,000. It will only use up to the next 2 expirations because FDs are life. The strike price will be in the range of +/- 5 strikes from the current underyling price.

    python wsbroulette.py -t ""TSLA,PLTR,GME,NIO"" -b 50000 -f

FD MODE! Generate 4 options for TSLA, PLTR, GME, NIO with a bankroll of $50k. Options are OTM, expire within 2 weeks and are 3-5 strikes out.

"NIO DD, bear time?",0.52,"So you know it and I know it too, this market in general is absolutely absurd and crazy, some people call it a bubble, other people call it priced in, and other people call it free tendies. Right now here is a daily chart of spy

https://preview.redd.it/n19jyt9w8m461.png?width=847&format=png&auto=webp&s=177496ec05c3156a645730d701ef8150ede13916

For the past couple weeks we have been slowly inching higher and higher, but sentiment in the overal market is that we are all greedy and stuff, we are in a bubble yatta yatta gay bears prophesizing the crash that will never come. However, loooking at the 20 SMA(green line) there has been a historical record of price of the spy going down after it touches the green line. This dosent happen all the time like you can see in august and may but 4 out of the 6 times that this has happened spy went on to go down for a few days after touching the green line. Right now we are about to touch that green line, and so far we have been red for a bout 3 days(writing this as of 3 pm on friday idk if we close green now). This leads me to be a little bearish on the overall market. 

&#x200B;

Now for NIO, this stock had a historic run where it constantly kept going up 10 percent every day and was free tendies with the hype of Electrical Vehicles, TSLA was also pumping and stonks only went up. Then PLTR came along and people ditched NIO the chinese EV company and PLTR went on to go massive up same as NIO, and NIO became less and less cool. Memes where spread, and not as many people where hype for NIO and went on to go full retard on PLTR cause tits literally couldn't go up. 

To get a clearer picture of NIO lets take a look at this intresting chart

&#x200B;

[Daily chart from a YouTube video ZipTrader\(not current chart, price rn is around 41.80\)](https://preview.redd.it/1v3zwwhgam461.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=db510d3a5c9b106997376b9d07cc55f03a79c02b)

SO we can see that according to this chart made from some random dude named ZipTrader, NIO price is mostly priced in by hype on NIO itself and EV hype. However you know it and I know it too, EV hype is dying, TSLA is going down, overall market is going down, and NIO hype is also going down. They arent many hot posts on this sub reddit anymore about NIO or pltr cause people tis are currently about to go up. Only hot post I could find was  this one, which will go into my main point.  

[Tesla chart comparable to NIO](https://preview.redd.it/egsp0z4ibm461.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=9798f3876039a15990d73aad4e61bb9408657c5f)

So with this TSLA chart, on the point that u/sncsoccer pointed out, TSLA went down pretty hard before recovering afterwards. Now why did TSLA Go down in this point and time? My theory was that it was due to a head and shoulders pattern. Looking at the chart he posted, it looks pretty similar to one, but not exactly a head and shoulders. 

[Daily chart of TSLA near early 2020](https://preview.redd.it/43mk7kvbcm461.png?width=857&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe8437e8e704a970e6e594c1102115035dd732e9)

Looking at a better chart here, you can vaguely draw a head and shoulders, and here it worked but tbh this didnt really look too much like a head and shoulders with that left shoulder being so high, but never the less it worked in the scenario. But the real head and shoulders is on NIO. lets take a look at NIO

[NIO daily chart ](https://preview.redd.it/ieyhqj7mcm461.png?width=871&format=png&auto=webp&s=32823eb77a091c55ba17ee062621b248723d5480)

Here is on this NIO chart is almost a perfect example of a head and shoulders, go look on your own at the chart and it will be clear as day. The shoulders, the head, the neck line, everything about it is perfect. Now for those of you who don't know what a head and shoulders are, its basically a bearish indicator where tits will go up and gay bears profit. Now that docent mean NIO has to go down or will go down 100 percent, but its a dam good bet after considering the spy chart, the tsla chart, the loss of hype on EV and NIO, and the bubble that we are in. I am predicting that NIO will go down to at least 40 dollars by the end of next week.

[Yahoo finance says NIO is bearish and detects bearish patterns](https://preview.redd.it/xfofacvqdm461.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=2971aec9f9e3456efe335f5efd3260d24e83cdb7)

Even yahoo finance says that this stock is bearish and has said it detected a bearish pattern. This on its own isnt much but when you combine it with everything else I have said maybe it starts to make sense. Also you can see the head and shoulders on NIO clearer here. 

That being said, all of you diamond hand NIO people could still be fine even after this massive drill that I think is going to happen cause just like tsla, NIO will likely recover. However, if you have weekly calls or anything close that, you may be fucked so if I were you id get out while you still could(nothing in this post is financial advise pls don't sue).  

&#x200B;

THE PLAY: NIO puts. I recommend getting something close to the money like the 40.5 put or the 40 put with about 3 weeks of time or more, but these can be a bit over priced right now since the stock is already down about 8 percent. If you are a bit more balsy and going WSB full YOLO mode then you could put money into the 39.5 put or even lower with even less time on the put, however, I recommend taking profits on this type of put very early since I think while it does have a good chance to go lower than 40 dollars, there isn't a guarantee that it will and also in that amount of time. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR; Puts on NIO, 40 strike 3 weeks of time or more, 39.5 strike put with less time if your feeling balsy. Tits can go up with NIO cause of the head and shoulders pattern on it and overall market is going down, EV Hype is dead, NIO hype is dead, Bubble burst happening soon, GAY bear time

"Your Tendie Stimulus IV: Don’t Buy the Dip (yet), Jerome has forsaken us",0.97,"EDIT: this is **not** meant to be super bearish— I actually think SPY probably has a green Monday. I’m saying targeted stock choices should be made based on/ once stimulus comes through, and in accordance with Wednesday FOMC decisions, rather than SPY calls at the moment. 

[UPDATE: interesting article from October talking about limited Fed maneuvers left](As DC delays stimulus, the Fed is running out of ways to help economy https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/28/the-fed-.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard)

———————————-

**Yes, its true**.  The liquidity programs we've come to know and love--the true ""pumps""—are stagnating or contracting, and it's clear SPY doesn't like this.  We are our own out there people. Let me break down for you how and why that is; and what we can do to save our tendies.

*First, let’s take a quick look at the vehicles that the FED has used to keep us propped up that I’m referencing:*

**Overnight short-term loans (Repo, Reverse Repo operations)**
*What It Is*
[More detailed description I did back in the day here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcdpox/dd_playing_vxx_and_spy_against_the_fed_repo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), but this is the process by which the FED has been giving banks overnight loans so they could make asset purchases.  They used to give these loans to each other, but the process became fucked up and expensive and the FED stepped in to fix this by offering the loans themselves at a low rate.  Once the pandemic hit, they took the unprecedented step of offering the loans with zero additional interest for themselves, basically offering free money.
[‘0 basis points over IOER’ is nerd speak for ‘fucking free money’](https://i.imgur.com/tD780yn.jpg)
**-Did it work?  Yes.**  
Fed Policy typically takes a couple of months to affect the market.  With that in mind, you can see that the performance of SPY correlates with the interest rate and bid volume on overnight repo operations.  Free money policy was instituted in March, and the impact gained full strength in the spring.
[look at this insane Repo activity in early June when the loans were free money. SPY was +7% month to date!](https://i.imgur.com/3bwjqd5.jpg)

**Treasuries** 
I won't go too deep into treasury purchases and its effect on market activity, but the simplified version is this; **if the FED needs to flood the market with money by pushing people to invest in vehicles aside from safe, boomer treasuries, they will buy up the treasuries themselves.**  This raises the price of treasuries by starving the market, thus giving them less yield--in other words, making them less valuable.  With less yield, people turn to stocks.  That's an oversimplified version of how it works, but you get the gist; the FED buys treasuries so people buy stonks.
**-Did it work? Yes**.
Take a look at the yield rate on treasuries here.  [At this time in 2019, the 20 year yield was up as high as 2.2%](https://i.imgur.com/1fLBbE3.jpg).  But, take a look at what happens after March.  The Fed begins buying up the treasuries, and the yield goes down to .98 in April.  All you need to know is that means the yield on treasuries was dogshit so people were pressured to buy stonks.
""How do you know this was the Fed's doing?""
They said it.  [Here is one of many statements from the FED](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_200312a) saying ""we are going to by the fuck out of treasuries at an increased rate because of COVID"".  How increased?  Take a look at this photo, we are talking about an average of 10 or 20 billion dollars, to 80 million dollars a clip.
[treasury spending increased 3 fold](https://i.imgur.com/J08Av7D.jpg)

**Bond Repurchases**
In March the FED announced they would be buying corporate bonds in another major boost to available liquidity.  Just as SPY got shaky, it was an added boost immeditely after the June  crash (a crash, btw, caused by a change in the repo loan interest rates).  Basically, when large companies need money they issue bonds to shore up cash that are available to the public (same shit as treasuries, basically)--the FED is now buying those bonds.  This direct infusion of cash from the FED is about as close to outright buying stock in companies as you can get.
**Did it work? Yes**. 
See: June rebound.  Also google some of the types of companies they're buying bonds from.  There's a reason why the fact that nobody is paying rent hasn't caused a mortgage-backed credit crisis for major banks...yet.

*So, weve established the main tools the FED uses to prop up the market and that they work.  What’s the problem, and why am I saying JPOW has forsaken us?*

**Because the Fed’s balance sheet has been contracting, and with that these programs are no longer offering nearly as favorable terms as they once were, but the market isn’t strong enough to handle those unfavorable terms.**

[here’s a graph from the FED showing their flatlining balance sheet](https://i.imgur.com/CoRcfBb.jpg)
The FED is spending less overall than it was earlier this year (remember, it takes a couple months for spending policy to catch up in the market).  *This was bound to happen, but the problem is the key programs I mentioned are all at obviously ineffective levels and haven’t been increased.* PROBABLY BECAUSE NOBODY COUNTED ON THE SECOND COVID SURGE DESTROYING PROGRESS IN EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS. 
**a) Repo operations haven’t been the zero-cost interest level since July**, moving from +0 basis points over the standard interest rate, to +5--and on longer term loan operations +10.  The market has not responded kindly to losing their free money, looking at the monthly SPY charts.
**b) While generous, the treasuries purchases have stalled out at 80 million**.  More importantly, the FED hasn't facilitated any key changes to which terms they purchase (long v short, etc). The market has responded to this stagnation with stagnation, looking at the monthly SPY charts.
**c) Bond purchases not set to increase**: The FED is still purchasing bonds, but have also stagnated the rates of that along with the other two facilities.  Kaplan, the Dallas Fed Chair who's always running his mouth, has [indicated a lack of support for increased corporate bond purchases. ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/kaplan-says-hes-not-in-favor-of-fed-increasing-bond-purchases.html)

**What the contracting FED balance sheet, the stagnation of these increased liquidity programs, and the lackluster performance of SPY over the past three months combine to signal is that the market/SPY is NOT healthy enough on its own to continue its rise.  Sure there will be good days, I even have a 267 exiting Monday, but the absurd gravy train of June-August is no more. If you take the 5 day election bump out the picture, SPY has performed over 50% less than its aggregrate performance April-August.**

Why did I say don't buy the dip YET? Is help coming?  Yes.  Two potential ways:
**1) The stimulus**: if enhanced UI benefits are improved, the spending in the consumer goods and credit market would provide a huge boost that could offset the economic effects of an increasingly bleek jobs situation.

**2) The FOMC meeting on the 16th**: this is where the FED would make any decisive changes on the lending programs mentioned here.  My guy /u/curiousmaniac pointed out to me that these changes, if they even happened, likely wouldn't come to fruition in the new year (even if the policy is changed on the 16th).

**So yeah, you might wanna chill on SPY. I hear you saying “where was this BEFORE TODAY?! REVISIONIST HISTORY”**

Other than that, monthly stimulus plays that favor consumer spending (on places that are at an advantage from hybrid online/retail models due to lockdown), TOL (housing numbers explode when stimmy passes), and TDOC because TDOC is dope. 

**WMT: 1/8 155c**

**TDOC 1/15 205c**
**AAPL: 1/8 126c**
**HPQ: 1/15 25c**
**TOL 1/15 46c**


**TLDR**: FED tools are drying up, SPY is too dangerous for now--market isn't strong enough on its own yet.  Count on monthlies that are a hybrid of pandemic retail/online winners in preparation for the stimulus, and pay attention the results of FOMC meeting on the 16th.  VXX sucks and I'm using TLT as a hedge.

So what's the nextt Tesla-Style stock?,0.44,"From Feburary Tesla went up and analysts on both sides were wrong on if it will crash or when it would rise, it climbed up to over $1000 then dropped back down to $00 range on manipulated news, than in one week basically made all that up, exceeding $1000, and then did a stock split where it's climbed back to the 600's where it is currently..

While Tesla is still viable, for the average working man it's ***too expensive***, stocks over $150 will always be outside the working mans budget, but semi-far out the money options being $1000-$10,000 per ONE contract has also removed the budget mans ability to buy options. (unless they do spreads but that defeats the purpose.)

This is of course unless some idiot wants to pay .80 contract for the zero chance that Tesla gets to 950 in one week. The people who handled things correctly during Teslas months of run up have made hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars.

**So what's the NEXT Tesla, that will run up short-term AND long-term and** ***isn't a fad or obvious retail trap (like Nio, PLTR, etc.*****) that will grow to be another hundred thousand to million dollar maker within the next handful of months?**

The Hound of Hounslow (How an Autist Broke the Market),0.98,"On May 6, 2010, Jim Cramer’s brain broke. “That is not a real price,” he yelled to his monitor. “OK? That is not a real price.” Proctor & Gamble had just fallen 25% in a manner of minutes, then 29%, then 31%. Cramer had never seen such a shiny knife, such a beautiful buy, and he searched frantically for the right camera to beg his followers to add PG to their portfolio. 

There weren’t enough buttons on Cramer’s soundboard to fully capture how he felt about the quickest drop in Dow Jones history. In what would later be dubbed “The Crash of 2:45” or simply “The Flash Crash,” over a trillion dollars was wiped from the stock market in a manner of 15 minutes. The odd thing was, despite dropping more than 9% at one point, the market would rapidly recover a bit after 3 PM and would close only 3% lower for the day.

In the ensuing days and weeks, journalists and financial commentators and United States Congressmen would try and determine where this volatility had come from. Something *weird* had just happened.

\#

In the investigations that followed, regulators would consider a couple of theories. Was this a “fat-finger trade” where a trader inadvertently placed a large sell order, triggering a domino effect of sorts where algos would in turn sell? Was this a well-coordinated cyberattack, aimed to cripple American institutions? Was it simply a dip exacerbated by high-frequency traders? Had Janet Yellen forgotten to change the printer toner?

Nobody knew. But five months after the flash crash, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) released a joint report that on May 6, 2010 the market was “so fragmented and fragile that a single large trade could send stocks into a sudden spiral.” They stated that a group called Waddell & Reed Financial Inc. had inadvertently played a role in the crash by initiating a sale of 75,000 E-Mini S&P contracts ($4.1 billion total) as a hedge to an existing position. This, the report said, coupled with the high-frequency traders trying to sell the long futures contracts they had just picked up from Waddell & Reed, led to a game of “hot potato” where the contracts were resold to other HFTs.

The report though was leaving out a crucial player.

\#

In 2005, Navinder Sarao was living the dream. At 27 years old, he still lived with his parents in Hounslow, a working-class suburb outside of London, demanding tendies to be delivered to his bedroom by his sweet emigrant mother. To the people who knew him, Navinder, or Nav, was known to be quick-witted and quick to anger. He was dominant at Halo and FIFA, and he had a proclivity to focus on one task for hours and hours on end until he mastered it. He was almost obsessive in his interests.

Despite still living with his parents, young Nav had aspirations. In 2006, he responded to an ad in the Evening Standard that read, “Wanted: futures traders. Must work well under pressure.” That’s it. That was the ad. And Nav, with no experience and a honey mustard-stained tie, went to the FutexLive headquarters—a drab office situated above a supermarket 45 minutes outside London—and successfully hid his Asperger’s and got the job. He was now a professional trader.

Nav picked things up quickly. Realizing that he was surrounded by day-trading retards, he moved his desk to the corner of the shabby trading floor and bought a pair of noise-canceling headphones. He’d found success trading E-mini S&P Futures, which is the primary futures trading vehicle for the S&P 500. And with his noise-canceling headphones, Nav would follow the orders that would enter and leave the markets. His coworkers would marvel at the autist in the corner and the returns he was regularly pulling in.

Then 2008 happened. By the time the financial crisis was in full swing, Nav was almost thirty and had decided to leave Futex. He had accumulated $2 million from his trades the last couple of years, and he figured the most prudent move as a budding millionaire was to set up his command center in his bedroom. He still lived with his parents.

\#

Nav realized something early on in the mortgage crisis that not everyone else did. He realized that governments would be forced to step in and save these retarded institutions, and he knew the banks wouldn’t be allowed to fall. And he bet $2 million—his whole net worth at the time—that he would be right. He made this bet on a Friday, and the following Monday, George Bush announced the TARP plan.

Prices proceeded to recover 19% over the next couple of weeks, and Nav rode the wave and turned his $2 million into $15 million. Did he rest on his laurels? Fuck no, this kid’s retarded! Nav didn’t want a wife and a home with a couple of kids running around. He wanted GLORY.

\#

Around 2010, the markets were seeing an influx in high-frequency trading, and Nav took personal insult to these robots. People were getting scalped by these algos, and those scalps belonged to Nav. Those profits were rightfully his.

In order to beat the robots, Nav decided to build his own robot. And unsurprisingly, fueled by Code Red and autism, Nav’s algo worked magnificently. Pretty soon, he was regularly pulling in half a million a day. All the while living in a cramped bedroom of his parents’ home that cost $300,000.

\#

May 6, 2010, started out as a regular day for Nav. The markets were sliding a bit, and Jim Cramer was flailing about his studio as though he were fighting a cloud of bats, but this was roughly on par for the time. Nav’s algo was pumping E-mini sell orders into the market—$200 million worth of orders to be exact—which ultimately resulted in a loss of liquidity (don’t ask me how this worked, I’m still confused why my PLTR 12/11 40C aren’t printing). At around 1:40 EST, or 6:40 in Hounslow, his mother called from the bottom of the steps to inform Nav that din-din was ready and would he please come down. 

So Nav logged off.

And exactly one minute after that, the market began to fall at a rate that had never seen before. Nav had no idea though; he was in an argument with his father about why he needed to chew with his mouth open in order to let the scalding tendy fumes out. A trillion dollars had been wiped from American markets, and the instigator of it all was too retarded to know what he’d done. 

The tendies were good though.

\#

The trillion-dollar loss turned out to be not that big of a deal. The DOW snapped back from the 9% freefall like a rubber band, like any stock that Andrew Left has deemed to be a casino. But the NYSE and NASDAQ officials proceeded to meet over the next couple of months to try and determine what caused the nosedive and rapid recovery. In the reports that they would write, regulators made no reference to manipulation and no reference to Nav. In fact, he wasn’t even aware there was an investigation going on. He wasn’t aware he did anything wrong.

But regulators eventually began to notice that Nav was canceling a lot of orders. The CFTC sent him an email and asked if he could explain what he’d been up to. What was the reason for his canceling an obscene number of orders? That’s what big banks did. And that’d usually be fine and all, but Nav was a singular trader and that made it suspicious. 

Nav wrote back to the CFTC explaining in careful terms that he had nothing to apologize for and that the CFTC could kiss his ass. He actually sent that. He told the CFTC to kiss his ass. Which, in hindsight, might’ve been a bad idea but the regulators were still too stupid and boomery to charge him with anything at the time. Nav would’ve gotten away with it too if it weren’t for a blabbermouth desk trader in Chicago who months later reported a different block of Nav’s trades to the CFTC, rekindling the case against Nav.

The investigation and case were dragged out over months and years, and I know 99% of you were too impatient to get this far, so I’ll give the cliff notes for the rest. Basically, Nav would eventually be charged with “spoofing,” which is the purchase of a large block of orders with the intent to cancel them. Spoofing artificially drives prices higher or lower. So the FBI and other concerned parties showed up on the doorstep of Nav’s Hounslow townhome in 2015, and he was extradited to the U.S. The judge learned he was worth $50 million, so he set bail to $7.5 million. Curiously enough though, Nav couldn’t access the $50 million or pay bail, and it was later determined that he’d somehow lost the fortune, seemingly to various shady investment advisors who promised to keep his money safe. (I personally like to think he’s stashed his earnings into a Caribbean account and that he’ll return to his private island once things blow over)

Over the next couple of months, Nav worked with investigators and taught them how market abuse happens. He was diagnosed with Asperger’s by a prison doctor, and the judge, sensing the moral dilemma of incarcerating an autist, and sensing Nav had received punishment enough from being scammed out of his $50 million, recommended a year of house arrest. 

So Nav is currently serving his year of house arrest in the same bedroom where he amassed $50 million. But now he’s penniless at 41. 

TLDR: Some autist beats the system, but the casino is angry and creates new rules to retroactively punish him for his winnings.",2020-12-11 12:30:58
Closing 2020 with the greatest Bull run of the Year?🚀🌙,0.9,"To my respected Retards,

Its coming babayy!!.. SPCE's in a perfect hot water jacuzzi!**🚀🚀🚀** Not too many talks about it yet. Flight updates coming in smooth. Flight window opens up tomorrow on Friday the 11th. And the 2020 Santa Rally is very very close! Anything below $35 is literally a fukin steal rn! **🚀🚀**Some institutions and big dicks on WSB were waiting for a run up with the test flight, but the SpaceX rocket explosion made them pull out early, causing a short pullback. Call it fear of not having a Virgin Galactic bull run or whatever the fuck you want!!! This spaceship is goin to the stratosphere sending the stock to the fuckin moon before year ends. Period.

While SpaceX is in the business of changing humanity, Virgin Galactic is in the business of sending rich retards to space. Making the latter more profitable in the near short term and long term. This was an untouched problem before, taking astronauts to mars and back is not the same as creating a repeatable, predictable, profitable business, launching rich retards into space for 90mins and back safely so they can post their pics n videos online! **🚀🚀🚀**1400+ rich fucks have already bought tickets and more rich fucks are signing up for the experience and for an exclusive dope ass tweet/insta post. (With a fuck ton of money in you 40s/ 50s.. would you consider buying a ticket to space?? If you thought of saying yes.. keep reading coz you've probably ignored obvious calls enough!)

Before entering into 2021, we'd have already finished with the first true sub orbital spaceship test, opening 2021 with an entirely new type of tourism! Ask your grandma why this is a huge fuckin deal! She knows better! With 2 successful test flights down already, this one's the third. It will cause a lot of noise towards year end!  Will probably give our first passengers from Hollywood an orgasm, just watching it on TV. You tell me how social media reacts when Hollywood gets an orgasm!??**🚀🚀🚀** Stock is crossing a $45 price point easy peasy! **🚀🚀🚀🚀**Recall that Feb 2020 saw a crazy 3 day bull run, stock rocketed 30% for nothing, just a normal flight!

This flight is a big fuckin deal! Additionally, the timings perfect, the catalyst's perfect, Santa rally is just round the corner, autists and humans pouring in their yearly bonuses, end of a fuckin COVID crazy year, spaceships hitting the stratosphere for the first time, a whole new fucking business ready to take off, daddy Richie inaugurating human launches in 2021 and your telling me this stock ain't worth nothin just coz they aren't earning rn? By the time its 2025, you're gonna see and hear spaceships launching rich retards into space all around you. And Virgin Galactic, this baby will have shot past the moon!

Got in on $PLTR when it was $14.20.. before it was a meme stock.. for this darling, the test flight window is lookin great, all the bulls suited up, oxygen masks on! Its your call bitches, coz this things goin up with or without you!**🚀🚀🚀🌙**

**Infobit:** SPCE ain't SpaceX. Google the fuckin ticker already!

**TL;DR**  $SPCE is very close to printing big dollars out of launching rich retards to space in a repeatable, predictable and profitable way! The stock is hitting $46-48 or higher before year ends after the test flight is done.

**TL;DR TL;DR** $SPCE is heading for the moon with or without you! Your call! Your put! **🚀🚀🌙🌙**",2020-12-11 07:42:10

First off **PLTR**:

&#x200B;

It is respecting the hard support zone of 26.95 to 27.30 (red lines)... for some reason it loves that zone, earlier in the week it dipped to this zone and stayed for awhile before dropping down to 25 bucks but as we saw today, it exploded right back to that zone and consolidated in it before breaking that resistance for a short period of time.

&#x200B;

Like I said 27.30 is a hard wall to break but with that being said, if PLTR breaks and can hold above this resistance... 

we will see 29.15...if it holds this level

My personal opinion... I don't think we're going under $600 again for awhile! Wednesday was a complete blood bath and it broke all the way to the 570 range if you needed a friendly reminder. 

As we saw today, people took advantage of the TSLA fire sale and instantly brought it back up to the 1HR Supply zone at around $620-622. If TSLA couldn't break that initial $600 resistance...would've been blood bath pt.2.

Keep in mind that TSLA did bounce off of 635 and instantly fell and consolidated back down to the support zone I just mentioned above. Another friendly reminder...**$635 was the support on Wednesday that BROKE AND TSLA WENT TO HELL.**

If we can break and hold 624.90 resistance, TSLA will say hello to that $635 resistance again...if we break 635

Next stop is $650

Get in on the next LAZR before it pops (DM just went public this morning),0.75,"If anyone has been paying any attention to the stock market's biggest gains over the past two weeks they would see companies heavily meme'd and now well known (PLTR, LAZR, etc). However, trying to get into any of those now is at worst going to lose you money and at best net you much smaller gains than the trailblazers who already sold for massive profit.

If any of you are interested in what could be the next big play to jump like GMHI did after flipping to LAZR, take a look at Desktop Metals ($DM), formerly TRNE. In a deal much like the LAZR launch, Desktop Materials went public with the support of TRNE, and as such the TRNE ticker flipped just this morning to DM. The DM CEO rang the opening bell, had an interview on CNBC, and is now probably enjoying his afternoon with hookers and blow after a killer morning. Additionally, TRNE is one of the SPACs that Chamath Palihapitiya leads, and anyone familiar with him will know how good he's been at getting these things right. 

The TRNE underlying has increased almost 50% in the last week and over 115% in the past month, but the reasoning behind why this play is still wide open is that it's been behaving very similarly to LAZR. Leading up to the ticker flip for GHMI/LAZR, the underlying jumped a huge amount to the 20s, but then stagnated the day the ticker actually flipped. However, that same day it jumped EOD and then continued to moon into the 40s, before eventually settling to where it is now (note: I'm not saying the stock is done moving in either direction, but it certainly isn't making moves like it was last week). 

TRNE, now DM, has performed very similarly for a few days now, it dips in the morning, hovers around -5% midday, then jumps EOD. Now with national media coverage and the offical public ticker flip to DM, should it jump EOD today, that might be the catalyst for a similar sky rocketing like we all saw with LAZR. Additionally, the risk is relatively low as far as SPAC mergers go since the deal has already gone through and the ticker has already flipped, so should this not moon, it likely won't correct down to $10/share, instead any downwards movement will likely be limited.

The company has an 2.5b valuation with a current $850 million market cap, and has customers and backers such as Toyota, Honda, GE, etc. This is a more solid SPAC play than the likes of NKLA, and they have the tech and history to prove it.

One main concern is that both the technology and the name aren't as flashy and meme-able as LAZR, but the company itself is actually much more solid and more likely to be a good long term play. While no degenerate here cares about long term, boomers do. If this starts jumping, expect boomer fomo to take it to the moon or even Mars.

TL;DR
TRNE ticker flipped to DM, behavior and backstory very similar to GHMI to LAZR, we all know what happened there, get in before this stock hits $40 per share ($22/share as of this post)

The Next PLTR - C3.ai (AI),0.51,"I'll make this short and sweet. 

AI is used for making more accurate predictions. If you can make more accurate predictions, you can fucking mint money. What if you could automatically know how much to price a airline ticket to sell out every single time, down to a penny. How about know exactly how many pairs of size 6 leggings you need to make this quarter down to within 0.25%. How about exactly what ads to show someone to maximize dollars spent on Instagram every year. This is what is happening billions times a day behind the scenes. 

&#x200B;

[C3.ai](https://C3.ai) brings the power that has brought AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, and FB to the rest of enterprise. AI models are difficult to deploy, tweak, and manage. This shit is brand new, there is very little talent. [C3.ai](https://C3.ai) helps companies implement AI into their business through their full featured platform. 

&#x200B;

When you are looking for good software you want to find something that is defensible / complex, yet easy to implement, and obviously valuable to the end user. The reason ServiceNow can charge JP Morgan 60 million dollars a year is because it saves them 500. For C3, deploying these models is easy because they have pre-builts that they can adapt to any business, a platform to run them on, is cloud agnostic, and the internal talent that even medium organizations wouldn't be able to find / use effectively. A single AI implementation can be worth 10s, 100s of millions of dollars to an organization, and you don't think they will be happy to pay [C3.ai](https://C3.ai) through the nose to maintain it? AI capability will be table stakes in 2 years, if it isn't already. This is a pure-play on that. Look at the post IPO pop. Its time to go moon hunting boys.",2020-12-10 15:58:48

John Maynard Keynes and the theory of YOLO,0.98,"Well, my little YOLO lovers, it turns out that one of the greatest economists in human history, John Maynard Keynes was an OG WSB-level retard who thought he figured it all out (just like all of you). You could probably say he was an early 1ronyman, which means we are not alone and all blessed here.

In 1919, at the age of 36, after he published such profound studies as *Indian Currency and Finance* and *The Economics of War in Germany *, Johnny decided to give it a shot and make some $ as a speculator. As the true retard, Keynes traded on high leverage and you might even say that his broker was legit mentally disabled as he granted him a margin account to trade positions of what's worth almost $2,000,000 with just $200,000 equity (inflation adjusted but I might be a bit off. anyway, it was x10).

By that time he had already spent a lot of time studying economics which directed his interests toward trading international currencies and by 1920 he made something around $1.2M on francs and lost $500k on USD. In a rush of emotions, he went on a shopping spree in Rome and probably bought a lot of Gucci stuff. 

Being a happy man and inspired by his success, he put on his helmet and YOLO'd everything on the USD going up and the Deutschmark going down. But pretty soon he realized that his long-term economic predictions didn't work very well with short-term currency trading on high margins (maybe he also indulged in box spreads?). USD stayed flat for a while and the Deutschmark began a 3-month rally. So if in April he was sitting on net profits of almost $1M, by the end of May he did a backflip and landed on a $1M loss. He thought it was Wendy's but his brokers asked him for a minimum payment of $500k to keep his account open. He had to borrow his way out of it and eventually got the money to continue trading. 

and apparently that's how the phrase ""the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent"" was born. The true OG WSB member coined it for us all. Cheers and don't forget to go balls deep into PLTR 🚀🚀🚀",2020-12-10 14:20:45

selling cash secured puts on $PLTR,0.76,"Here to consult the retard committee. I’m (like all of you) bullish on $PLTR and thinking about writing puts, probably 1/21/22 $20p especially because I believe $PLTR is getting close to the bottom if its dip right now. 

My knowledge of the process: so long as $PLTR is above $20/share on 1/21/22, then I just collect my premium and all is well. If I get assigned, I’d love to own 100 shares at $20/each anyway and I have the cash, so that’s fine. 

The thing is, I really don’t understand the benefit/detriment of targeting a lower/higher strike. Should I go for something like 1/21/22 $15p so I get a better deal in the event of assignment even though my premium would be lower? Or does $20p make more sense? Should I write the puts for sooner than 1/21/22? I’ve tried googling but can’t seem to find a good answer.",2020-12-10 07:31:36

High Leverage Makes Money (Up Another $120K),0.77,"Fellas,

"PERI - Microsoft Contracts, ARK investment, Growing digital ad sector. Put it on your radar.",0.87,"As CTV options become more prevalent and advertising starts to ramp back up, the digital ad sector has been taking off lately with companies like trade desk (TTD) and Magnite (MGNI) mooning over the last few months. One smaller player that has caught my eye that hasn't had the same type of multi-bagger run yet is PERI (Perion Network). These guys have been around for a long time, but have recently started to revamp their business with some good acquisitions and added revenue streams in the last few years.

Great SA article posted yesterday which goes into a hell of a lot more detail and analysis than I will in this post (yeah, yeah, it's SA, but the article itself is actually pretty decent--go find it because I can't link it here). But the bottom line is things are looking solid heading into 2021 here. Just upped their guidance for next quarter, analysts targets all above current price with ""buy"" ratings, and they just renewed a four-year Microsoft contract expected to generate revenue between $170-190 million annually (according to their investor slide deck). Yes, that's close to a billion dollar contract with Microsoft for a company trading at a market cap of less than than $300 million. This is trading at a huge discount right now and could be an easy multi-bagger from here in my opinion. Stupidly undervalued right now in this sector compared to competitors (MGNI is the most comparable play in my opinion). Oh, by the way, Cathie and ARK are in here as well, with 160k shares as their third biggest holding in their IZRL ETF.

Buy in, or don't, I don't really care. But check it out if you are looking for new play that isn't TSLA, PLTR, or NIO (I'm loaded up in those as well, but I have to keep myself entertained with finding new stuff).

Anyway, I'll probably get downvotes for ""PuMpInG a SmAlL CaP,"" but oh well, i don't care if you buy or not. Do your own research, but this has been a money maker for me this week and wanted to put it on a few people's radars. Sure, it's a small cap, but it's a small float that can move quickly with good volume. Also, option volume and liquidity is actually pretty damn good with tight spreads usually (check out the OI on April 10c, lotta people been loading up and holding). It has had a great week on huge volume (2,000% above average) after raising guidance on Monday, and it also held up exceptionally well today despite the NASDAQ taking a fat dump. I bought a decent lot of April 10C contracts at open yesterday that I am up over 150% on already, but I am holding for a possible five to ten bagger here. Still accumulating shares at this level as well. A lot of upside potential here in my opinion. My near term price target is $15 by early 2021. $20 would then be my likely exit point on all of my calls (unless I am feeling greedy, which happens way too often, so probably....).

TL;DR: digital ad space, microsoft contracts, Cathie and ARK, analyst buy ratings up the ying yang. I'm in for 40 contracts of April 10C.",2020-12-10 00:57:52

*OK. And then, in terms of the new shelf, you know, I saw that you mentioned general corporate purposes. Would you consider issuing stocks to repay debt under that program?*

*George Sherman -- Chief Executive Officer*

*No, that's absolutely not the intent. The intent here is to simply optimize flexibility and optionality. Period. There is a lot of unknowns going on in the marketplace with respect to this pandemic, ongoing flex of cases across the world, the impacts on our own businesses.*

*And we're not immune to that, right? And, in that regard, look, we're going to continue to execute our strategies that have bolstered and strengthen our balance sheet. And you see all the work that we've done, including, if we go back to even the long-term debt levels in early 2019 until today, it's -- you know, as of this coming Friday will have reduced our long-term debt over $530 million, by March of '21, they'll be over $600 million. In that same timeframe, that same roughly 24-month timeframe, plus or minus, we also returned over $200 million to shareholders. So, I think -- look, the goal is to continue to focus on running the business and optimizing we run the business, but also be very pragmatic and make sure that we have capital flexibility with no intention to do anything other than maintain our flexibility.*

Previous update: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8pmkg/pltr\_fib\_held\_first\_profit\_target\_is\_still\_39/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8pmkg/pltr_fib_held_first_profit_target_is_still_39/)

To recap, the major fib of the entire move is still in play, with a first profit target of $39.3, denoted with **(arrow 'A')**

In the previous thread, I said to watch for a bearish reversal at $29. Well, we bazooka'd through $29 and got within < 10% of the ATH. However, look how quickly it was rejected and came back to the $29 range. This was/is the only sell-side fib remaining and technically it has been 'broken' by the spike to $31, but the way the price has come down in today's session makes me consider it still in play. It has a profit target of $18.22ish **(arrow 'B'),** **which just so happens to line up with the 0.618 retracement of the major fib**, increasing the likelihood of the $18.22 level becoming a major pivot IF it were to get there. The unfolding price action also looks like it would create a clean 'ABC' down which is typical of corrections.

The good news: in order for this sell-side fib to get down to $18, it will first need to get through the 0.5-0.618 ($25-26.20) range of December's move up, which is the buy zone of December's move with a first profit target of 33.5 **(arrow 'C')**. Note: this target is at PLTR's ATH which may provide some resistance, (due to simple support/resistance and also if fib traders take profit there).

To the fib trader, there is no reason to be bearish on the price action *yet,* the big tell will be whether PLTR makes a turn **above** $25ish.

**If $25 doesn't hold, I anticipate further downside, with first support being the pivot low at $21.20 and the major support at $18.20. PLTR at $18.20 is what is called ""a gift""**

The way I'm expressing this trade is with a Jan 15'21 30/35 bull call, which I opened for $0.9",2020-12-09 18:24:02
Am I doing this right? Sold Pltr and CRSR to buy T @ 31.5 & $32 December & January calls.,0.8,"So I just opened my IRA this month, and funded with $400 before I deposit the full amount selling off some positions in my main account. My first 2 trades were PLTR and CRSR on Monday. Tuesday, I decided those were not enough, sold them, and rolled into $T (AT&T). Bought $31.5 and 32 December calls and some January - Feb $32. Maybe some of you say the $31.5 on the frontpage of best performers. I got the options later in my retirement account than my main unfortunately due to it not occurring to me that I had one initially. 

$T is a dream come true for investors. Here we have a nice boomer stock with a great dividend, and the HBO deal with WB represents a paradigm shift with some real juice. You know what Netflix did to cable? This is how significant the HBO deal is to show all WB movies in 2021.  I also have 7k in $T in my real, non retirement account, including $100 shares. 

The safe play here is the January - February options, because as people slowly awaken to the significance of the WB deal, this baby is going up, but it could be a more gradual process. Options are still incredibly cheap for the longer options owing to $T's traditional stability, but that wont be so tomorrow. $11.4 billion of box office tickets are sold in North America alone every year. Now HBO and friends are going to vacum this up. Also felt good to get my $31.5 on the list of best options the day before, but I didn't get in early enough owing to an 11AM meeting that interrupted my ""DD"". 
Ignore this rocket ship at your own peril, or, just buy stock, would take some effort to lose money on it over a multi-month holding period. Do not buy strikes farther than $35. The stock doesnt need to moon for your options to go to mars. Even 10% on the stock would be a colossal gain on the options. 

Stock moves up $2, the current December 32 C becomes a 10 bagger. Other options move less but this is just to emphasize just how little the stock needs to move to hit 100% on all the options listed.

PLTR at these Valuations,0.58,"TL;DR: My admittedly slightly 🐻🌈 on PLTR at these prices. Sell puts at around 24 if you have no current position in underlying. Sell CC at around 30-33 if you do.

**My play on PLTR**

I'd really like to see a pullback to \~25 (or lower ideally) ... then I would load up on calls, shares, and sell a bunch of put credit spreads. I like PLTR, but I hate these valuations... it may be I don't know enough about the company, but I have friends who work with it in DC. The problem is that the software platform requires heavy customization for every client... this is a big scaling issue..and I cannot find any data on how PLTR plans to scale to justify valuations at the SNOW level (which is where this thing would need to go to be a huge money-maker at these prices).

**The major problems I see with PLTR are:**

* Highly dependent on govts. Palantir has to be careful with profits so that it doesn't reek of perceived abuse (irrespective of actual value). They risk inquiries, GAO (Government Audit Office) audits, downsizing, and potential cancellations depending on the internal pressure. I believe this is why they are angling for surveillance, etc as those contracts are less transparent by nature, which mitigates this challenge some
* Customizations - makes it tough to scale big time a la SNOW
* Lockup Period - there will be major downwards pressure on the stock when this ends mid-February. 

**The good:**

* Rockstar management and backing
* Super-compelling offering with what is to be the major problems at govts/corps (parsing signal from noise in the data due to data overload)
* Should be majorly profitable

**Summary**

I like PLTR. I am a bit wary at these prices, since it's tough to gauge if this is a pure SaaS or a consulting company. Given Thiel's involvement, and heavy insistence on platform plays, I am inclined for this to be the former. I'd like to see a bit of pullback first and IV to come down. In the meantime, selling weekly puts to take advantage of the sky high IV.

Any other insights? Anything I missed and should be added?

PLTR - Technical Analysis from a Professional Investor - Update 12/8,0.94,"So I did an update 4 days ago telling you why PLTR at 22 was the short term bottom,

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k63z6b/pltr\_technical\_analysis\_from\_a\_professional/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k63z6b/pltr_technical_analysis_from_a_professional/)

now I will go over how to trade the stock in the next couple of weeks.

As you can see in the chart below, we are replicating the movements made by Nio in the first phase of its run-up. We had the initial run up from about $5/share to $16 and then a fall and consolidation to about $10. It then subsequently moved up to about $15 giving the illusion of a double top and trapping all the bears when it then fell to $12 before rocketing up to $20.

https://preview.redd.it/f2q9pv3310461.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4617e401f9dbbfc32d1e925972834c40306f529

Again, chart looks the same as Tesla in the transition from the first run-up to the second run-up. You had a short term top at around 185, a drop to 68 (much higher fib retracement likely due to more short seller interests being accumulated at this point), recovery to around 170 and then a small drop to 150 before the next leg up.

https://preview.redd.it/eguhknb1k0461.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7b8c5f61d6197e949a76d7be1b039feaa307f8f

&#x200B;

In a similar way, expect consolidation for a couple of days and a near term bottom of around 23-26 before the next leg moves up. If we go by Nio, expect a target of $41-45 over the next 2-3 weeks. So get out of your 12/11 weekly calls now, those won't pay out and will likely just eat theta.

https://preview.redd.it/wemw3ofszz361.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e3d6ba992b74ea6260ff956ba5c2dc300a5f8cf

Option convexity is also sort of at a mid point between the lows achieved on 12/2 and the extremes exhibited on 11/25, which tells you we are sort of nowhere near a short term bottom or a short term top.

https://preview.redd.it/xlpdfz1hzz361.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2d7e5841e6d5517b4c93d3e2d5182a26e392b12

I did not bother playing this expected short term volatility as I bought 1/15 calls at the $22 low. But you'll probably get another chance at it if we see PLTR at the 24-26 range.

**TLDR: roll out your 12/11 options, bet on 12/25 options at the earliest, best strikes are 25-35. Cashout at least 2/3 if PLTR hits $41-44.Don't be surprised if we have a couple more down 10% days this week to burn out the 12/11s.**

&#x200B;

Update1 (2:25PM): Rising wedge developing on the 5 minutes, don't be surprised by some big drops in the coming couple of days. Good time to build position.

Update 2 (11:00AM): had a initial drop. Got a another rising wedge. We are going below 27 today and probably bottom about 24-26. I doubt we’ll move too much above 25 until next week. Again the 12/11s will expire worthless
 
Update 3 (10:45AM): we likely bottomed at 25.2. We had a double bottom this morning at 25.7. There is still a small chance maybe we'll drop down to 23-24, but its pretty unlikely at this point. We'll be somewhat range bound between 26-27 until next week when the full run-up will start.",2020-12-08 17:35:26

The Affirm IPO and A New Way to Rip People Off,0.87,"So I was browsing LULU looking at new joggers (ok fine, I was checking out the guys/girls modeling their shit) and it says $128 OR 4 payments of $32 with Afterpay which made me realize I have seen a lot of ""offers"" like that and wanted to see if it is a money making opportunity.

**TL;DR: Buy Affirm when its IPO goes live. Former PayPal execs are starting microlending and ""buy now, pay later"" companies which could become the modern credit card. Affirm is a large one is going to IPO with a potential $100M offering. The Affirm/Shopify partnership could be like Ebay/Paypal back from the internet stone age**

**EDIT 1: There's no IPO date schedule. Will probably be early next year**

For the purpose of this DD, we will be looking at Sezzle and Afterpay which are currently publicly traded and Affirm which has recently registered for an IPO (more on that later). All of these companies bill themselves as Fintech companies offering alternative payment platforms and a micro financial lender. Merchants have an incentive to sign up with one of these guys because the payment platform assumes the risk while the business gets advertised on their service. These companies make money by charging merchant fees and interest on missed payments.

Starting with Sezzle cause that is the least interesting, its listed on the upside down market in Australia trading around $5 but is HQ'd in Minnesota and has [estimated revenue](https://growjo.com/company/Sezzle) of \~30M.  Sezzle reported in February that they had achieved 1M users and now with the pandemic are estimated to be around 1.8M. 6 months ago they brought in [former PayPal executive](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paul-paradis-promoted-to-company-president-and-veronica-katz-from-paypal-to-take-chief-revenue-officer-role-301090602.html) Veronica Katz as Chief Revenue Officer. Sezzle [advertises](https://sezzle.com/merchants) its business product as ""Engaging the next generation"" and the ability to ""unlock millions of users and increase sales with zero risk"".

Next is AfterPay, an actual Australia based company. They [reported](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/afterpay-announces-full-year-results-301119541.html) their year ending June 30 and revenue topped **$11B with 10M Users and 55.4K merchants.** There are tons of highlights in that report which are worth the scroll. Afterpay has a huge number of customers/products to choose from including the aforementioned LULU and other major retails stores youve heard of. They also have tons of Becky products on there including Shein, Ulta Beauty, Soma, and other places your girl shops at.

This company, unsurprisingly, is teeming with former PayPal folks. [VP Xin Ge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xin-ge-b6b258?trk=org-employees_profile-result-card_result-card_full-click) 7 years at paypal, [Dana Stalder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dcstalder/?trk=org-employees_profile-result-card_result-card_full-click) VP back in 04-08 who is now a VC and on the Afterpay board, [Amanda Pires](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandapires1/) 9 years at Paypal now a VP at afterpay. the company is also littered with former Visa and citigroup folks

At this point for those still reading you understand what this game is all about, Affirm does the same thing as the other two. We're going to talk about Affirm and its upcoming IPO. Affirm's CEO/founder is [Max Levchin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxlevchin/) who YOU GUESSED IT was an original cofounder of Paypal and was the CTO. Affirm shares unprofitable status like so many other silicon valley companies (PLTR, UBER, etc) but totaled 174M in Q1 2020 revenue. The biggest draw here for Affirm is it's [partnership](https://www.affirm.com/press/releases/affirm-to-power-shopify-shop-pay-installments) with Shopify to use its installment payment platform and gain access to shopify's >200M users. Affirm filed for an IPO to offer 100M in stock with an unannounced IPO date but will probably go in the next few months. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like there is a way to get exposure before IPO (unless you like Morgan Stanley) but the [investors](https://equityzen.com/company/affirm/) in this should tell you how big this company could be. That being said Affirm is seeking to be the credit card of the next generation who have no concept of money but will gladly take the pay for it later method. While they aren't yet profitable, this is a potential billion dollar company with potential buyouts from SQ, big banks, in the future.

**Conclusion: These companies are a hybrid of payment processors, micro lenders, and advertisers that support merchants of all sizes. With the continued explosion of online shopping and the natural human desire to worry about it later, investing in Affirm at IPO could be like getting in the ground floor of PayPal. We know about the PayPal mafia but even the lesser known execs are working on some very forward leaning companies that have huge potential. Affirm is going to IPO and its rocket both short term and long term**",2020-12-08 16:09:13

While TSLA is by far my largest position, I have been steadily increasing my NVDA position as well - for years. I think it's time we gave a serious look to this Rocket Ship 🚀🚀🚀🚀",2020-12-08 07:00:20
Board the rocket that is *VXRT*,0.73,"So here is some DD from myself. Myself being an admitted amateur, but knows how to read patterns and news when I see it. Tired of seeing the word PLTR? Well, in a short couple of months you may get tired of seeing VXRT.

**What is VXRT?**

Vaxart, Inc., a clinical-stage biotechnology company, engages in the discovery and development of oral recombinant protein vaccines based on its proprietary oral vaccine platform. The company's product pipeline includes norovirus vaccine, an oral tablet vaccine, which has completed Phase I clinical trials with bivalent oral tablet vaccine for the GI.1 and GII.4 norovirus strains; seasonal influenza vaccine, which is in Phase II clinical trials for treatment of H1 influenza infection; respiratory syncytial virus vaccine; and coronavirus vaccine. It is also developing therapeutic immune-oncology vaccines for cervical cancer and dysplasia caused by human papillomavirus. The company has a research collaboration agreement with Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. (Janssen) to evaluate the company's proprietary oral vaccine platform for the Janssen universal influenza vaccine program. Vaxart, Inc. is headquartered in South San Francisco, California. 

&#x200B;

**YTD History**

VXRT was a penny stock coming into the new year and quickly found its feet mid summer rocketing up to 15 per share, 5 dollar short of its 5 YR ATH in 2016. VXRT has been trading relatively sideways for the past couple of weeks and is teetering on being an interplanetary rocket that soars well past the moon. 

&#x200B;

**My Research and Thoughts**

VXRT will be offering among many other vaccines, and ORAL COVID-19 vaccine. That's right, oral. Now, Why is this huge you might ask? Well for starters the current vaccines are sensitive to specific temperatures and makes transportation ,storage, and administration a large hurdle. With a pill form it can be distributed en mass, globally, in any regular package. This not only relieves staffing issue to administer a vaccine on such a grand scale, but also allows many people that have a huge fear of needles to take it in an oral form. 

The company is getting ready to publish phase 1 trials and finding with word of this happening around December 10. They recently hired a team of 5 manufacturing experts and have quality control expert job openings, which to me signals a need for an all hands on deck operation for when the manufacturing officially starts soon. Vaxart will be the first company to actually bring out mucosal immunity. 

There are grumblings of a **Bill Gates** connection with a new Stanford hire at VXRT. If you dig deep enough, things start to get pretty interesting. Pfizer also recently came out and said that they would have trouble with initial demand for the vaccine and might not have enough till summer of 2021, in turn allowing other major players to enter the market and crush. Joe Biden said it himself, 

 ***“Cost of actually getting the serum into an injection needle into someone’s arm costs a lot of money. It takes a lot of people. It takes a lot of folks to get this done. We have to have a much better way than what we have seen to get this distributed.”***

Here is some nice DD from someone I have no affiliation with but backs up my thoughts: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuofzQ73An0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuofzQ73An0)

&#x200B;

**TLDR**

There is risk. But this risk will pay off. A pill form vaccine is going to take us to the moon. Once funding is secured my bets are on a moon past 30 by first quarter.

PLTR DD

Starting point**:** 

**RECENT EVENT REACTION**: Palantir's traction with large government contracts, such as its recent $44 million order with U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Covid-19 treatment approvals, could be a sign the company is finding success with expanding uses of its products beyond defense, terrorism threats, cybersecurity and fraud detection. Still, customer concentration and lack of a cloud-based subscription model could limit Palantir's revenue-growth visibility beyond 2021. (12/08/20)

1. Palantir: Company Outlook THESIS: Palantir's software use for contact tracing and supply-chain analysis during the pandemic could be a tailwind for top-line growth and new-customer additions in the near-term. While the company's addressable-market view remains clouded by its lack of a partner ecosystem and reliance on large government customers for sales, we believe Palantir's proprietary datasets and shortening deployment times could help broaden its potential uses and diversify the customer base. Investments in building direct services 

**Valuation Unlikely** to Match Cloud IPOs Palantir is unlikely to garner a valuation similar to pure-play cloud-software IPOs, which averaged a 65% gain in their public-market debuts. While the company has strong intellectual property, built around the use of big data for its analytics offering, we believe its top-line growth in the $26.5 billion analytics tools software market could be limited by growing competition from stand-alone providers such as Tableau (bought by Salesforce.com) and Qlik, as well as hyperscale-cloud peers including Microsoft's Power BI and Amazon AWS. Palantir's lack of a partner ecosystem limits its operating-margin expansion, in our view. The company's multi-class voting structure, with a majority of voting rights for its co-founders, and a lack of customer diversification could hurt institutional interest. (09/29/20)

However in my report of PLTR I strongly believe that it has the momentum for the next quarter to strongly outperform the news and it could be traded at an overvalued price for much longer, and because of this short term profits could be made on this investment. 

Fundamental 

[Figure 1 ](https://preview.redd.it/g6m3pl14yu361.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=318c5c280ec41cd92ab20d6abe9e360779e92eb6)

We can see that in the sector that they are in they are performing better than the competition in terms of sales Their EBIT is quite high and their p/e rate is lower than the competition. If we look at the recent sales and buys done we can see that the rate of institution ownership went up quite a bit. This is in fact good news for us. And we can see growth from here.

[Figure 2 ](https://preview.redd.it/xhxbebu9yu361.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ebe37d79b17578b839301d986f93ba44bf2b463)

&#x200B;

a) The operating income is almost double in loss but this should not discourage the prediction because it’s a new IPO and they are using their money to grow their operations so this would be expected. The total debt increased however this is also due to the rapid growth of the company and them expanding 

**What does the company do?** 

Data analytics is their prime focus since IPO earlier this year they have +160% after announcing their FDA response and the company working with news on working with Greece with their covid-19 response they have gained 20% today The stock is up big on Monday after the company reportedly won a new FDA contract to use Palantir software to help the agency conduct drug reviews. The software will help the FDA with drug approvals, including potential COVID-19 treatments.

Palantir CEO Alex Karp also joined Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on a teleconference to discuss Palantir's partnership with Greece to support COVID-19 response efforts. Since the start of the pandemic, Palantir has worked with the Greek government to help guide decisions on how to best deal with the crisis.

**The ownership** 

of institutions is up by 2% and the # of buys is up by 100% indicating to us that the market is deciding to go long on this stock. These are all bullish indicators and tell us a story; a story of going to the moon. 

b) Other investments made to the company are all up and long on the stock. 

c) This shows us the ownership of the company. 

[Figure 4 ](https://preview.redd.it/cazcwwclyu361.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=803bbd3c253b0bfe0b5604523637c3743b5f456a)

**Insider Purchase sales** 

We can see at the rally 2 weeks ago that insider selling was high this could indicate to us that there where massive sell off however as I previously mentioned there is momentum to the stock and that the news of many insider selloffs didn’t effect the rally tells us that this stock has the potential to go even higher. I would suggest that these sell offs where purely psychological and they where done by people that invested their money since the company IPO mostly from within the company so this does not indicate to us that the price would go down. 

[Figure 5 ](https://preview.redd.it/43m30xvnyu361.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f4f00fabf1feb1fae7ae70ba746ebc417bc95316)

&#x200B;

**Sells of PLTR** 

The majority of the institution holders were selling at the rally last week. However, they didn’t sell completely and decreased their position size. This is just because its part of their trading strategy and when there is a rally that big in order to hedge the massive investments they have to do a partial sell ofs of their position. They would eventually buy back in at the next rally because there is just enough momentum to keep the stock going higher( they are just buying the dips) 

[figure 5 ](https://i.redd.it/3y755zdryu361.gif)

 

**Earings report** predictions say that the earings are matched with the stock growth and this should b an indicator that the company is performing in touch with reality and that it is not that overvalued at this point of time and that the extrinsic value that is brought to us by the recent news would rally this stock higher. 

Operating profit to stock price.

**Supply Chain**

In the supply chain of PLTR 

We can see that their top 10 competitors are doing similar in their sector and that their majority customer is the US government which makes them a reliable source because they have unlimited money :P so they would pay regardless. This supply chain is fairly simple however it creates a better foundation for the companies foundation. 

In short, I think that the PLTR has more room for growth and we can expect $40-45 by end of Q1 and I am in a long bullish position for this company,

The bounce at the 0.5 held and we've just broken above the 0.618 of the only remaining bearish fib left.

What we want to see here is that PLTR can stay above that 0.618. A bit of a sell reaction is to be expected (just like what happened when it broke above the 0.5 earlier today), but it's important to recognise that PLTR could reverse here for another leg lower. As far as sell-side Fib traders are concerned, 29 USD is exactly where that reversal would happen.

As can be seen from the volume profile (far left) there's seldom trade volume above here. This is excellent for bulls because it means a lack of 'trapped' longs that are desperate for a chance to get out at break even.

**tl;dr: first upside target is 39.3, but watch for a reversal to the downside here at 29**",2020-12-07 21:11:09

Do you want to bet against reddit? I have the answers,0.97,"I have been collecting and analyzing data from popular subreddits. This week I am looking at the options contracts that have been mentioned on the subreddits I track.  Specifically, I am looking at contracts expiring this Friday 12/11.    The data collected for this analysis was collected from 11/29 – 12/5.  For Friday’s expiration there are 186 contracts and 330 mentions of these contracts.  The most popular contract is the 12/11 TSLA 600 Call with 14 mentions.  


The goal here is to track what reddit is following and to see how reddit preforms.  There is this notion that retail investors often fail to beat the market. This is why financial advisors recommend that you buy into the major ETF’s such as SPY.  As historically there have been few people that manage to beat the major Index’s year over year.  My hypothesis going into this week is that I should bet against the trends on reddit as typically the retail investor is wrong.  


Call Data


* Out of the 186 contracts 150 are calls (+80%+ Long)  

* 75.3% of the calls are out of the money

* The out of the money Calls are an average of 23% out of the money. 

* The in the money calls are an average of 19.3% in the money. 


Put Data


* Out of 186 Contracts 36 are puts

* 86.1% of the puts are out of the money

* The out of the money puts are an average of 20% out of the money

* The in the money puts are an average of 8% in the money 


On both the call and put sides the out of the money contracts are an average of 20%+ out of the money.  I am not that surprised as there is a lot of yolo culture on reddit.  It is surprising to see the number of contracts that are out of the money in general.  Out of the 186 contracts only 42 are in the money as of last Friday’s close. 

The most popular calls that are in the money are the 

* TSLA 570 – 590 
* ACB 10.  

The most popular puts that are in the money are all NKLA.  

The most popular calls that are out of the money are the 

* TSLA 600 - 650, 
* GME 20, 
* PLTR 25 - 40, 
* AMD 100, 
* SPY 370 - 380,
* APHA 9.  

The most popular puts that are out of the money are 

* NKLA 15, 
* PLTR 15 – 21, 
* NIO 40 
* ACB 7.  

As I said above my hypothesis going into this week is that the majority of these contracts will end up being losers.  Based on this data I would probably look to sell the 370 Spy Calls and TSLA 600 calls if my hypothesis turns out to be right.  For now this is just for fun, but I will be running more in-depth analysis to see if I find anything interesting. 

Edit For reference as of 12/7 Market Open:

* SPY 370 Calls: $2.10
* TESLA 600 Calls: $2500",2020-12-07 17:56:58

All we want for Christmas is more Kohl. The bullish case for retail giant KSS,0.92,"My fellow mentally challenged brethren, it's time to lick our wounds from last week and ~~lose~~ make some more money.

Hopefully a few of you were able to benefit from my [SPG](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9wlle/simon_property_group_spg_is_about_to_lift_off) post a couple months back.     Lately, aside from getting my lunch and shirt stolen by PLTR I have been [playing options ](https://imgur.com/a/jzSJxrL)around the insane [Kohl's comeback](https://i.imgur.com/8tx1CBf.png) (and retail/REIT's in general tbf) that has seemingly gone completely unnoticed here.  Now, I do believe we are in for a week of market consolidation very soon all around, but I have reason to believe Kohl’s will continue trending towards pre-corona highs over the next 2 months and potentially all time highs over the next 1.5 years.

Hear me out autists, we should all want some Kohls in our stockings this Christmas.

# KSS is not done climbing.

First off, in case you missed it: **Kohl’s (KSS) is up +25% the PAST WEEK  and 92% over the PAST MONTH**. *What the fuck? -* is right my friend. - KSS currently trades at $40.90 after finishing an absolute burner of a week on the heels of [announcing their new combination store](https://www.barrons.com/articles/kohls-stock-sephora-coming-kohls-stores-51606836094) deal with Sephora makeup, you know that expensive lipstick your wife puts on to meet her boyfriend but wont touch for you? Ya them, they are coming to a Kohl’s stores near you next year and trust me when I say this: **The full scope of the increased customer exposure between Sephora and Kohl's Amazon Return program has not been fully realized by the market yet**,  they are still criminally undervalued by -25% from where they were before Coronavirus in spite of returning to profit in Q3.

**Store retail is not dead you fucking idiot**

Kohl’s is a fucking comeback champion.   If you think in-store retail is dead or on the verge of dying, then you actually need to get out of your basement at least once next weekend to [see for yourself](https://i.imgur.com/nKMPFZF.jpg) how alive and well it is. KSS has emerged several times in the past through various economic downturns- they were among the first retail giants to weather the 2009 recession and return to value- and if you have use of the brain behind that helmet you can see they are balls deep with a massive veiny erection as they do it once again.

https://preview.redd.it/wor64z93am361.png?width=1901&format=png&auto=webp&s=3adb4eef81733fb0fa45e390238b826f904d73b7

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aqok2d7h8n361.png?width=1619&format=png&auto=webp&s=deb7fb9516c1f7ae1fee3fa5086714a1f2c2fc51

&#x200B;

**Post-Pandemic Retail Consolidation favors the big boys**

They have already made and absorbed all the necessary changes and costs to maintain an open store in the face of the pandemic and somehow maintained a cash positive balance sheet on the year despite losing out on nearly a quarter of shopping days this calendar year.   Bullish AF\*

KSS is not sitting still while others have already fallen or shuttered - they have been among the most proactive department stores in adapting to the shifting consumer habits in the retail sector and I wouldn’t be the least bit surprised to see KSS reach all time highs (70+) by Q3 2022 or even sooner.

***Kohl's staying power has been solidified*** through this turmoil and the financial illiquidity of their competitors only presents less alternative consumer options. *(R.I.P JcPenney gang*)

&#x200B;

**MY TAKE**

My erection peaked for them during the last earnings call when the CEO reinstated the annual dividend which gave us the first clear internal indicator that they believe the worst is behind them.

>*Our third-quarter results exceeded our expectations with significant sequential sales and profitability improvement. We also further enhanced our financial position during the quarter, driven by solid operating cash flow.* ***We ended the quarter with more than $1.9 billion in cash and no amount outstanding on our revolver***\*. Based on the progress we are making and through disciplined capital management, we are pleased to share that we plan to reinstate a dividend during the first half of 2021\*. - Michelle Gass, CEO

The Sephora deal is a game changer for them bringing in an entire industry of shoppers that has also largely remained an in person shopping experience.  When women shop for clothes and makeup they still prefer not to buy on Amazon due to fit, size, and color inconsistencies.

**EARNINGS FOR NEXT QUARTER WILL EXCEED ANALYST EXPECTATIONS**

Earnings Momentum is a quirky nerd formula that measures the acceleration or deceleration of EPS growth over a trailing 12 month operating period - the upward curvature of the plotted points indicates that while earnings has predictably declined, due to a fucking pandemic, the most recent [EM chart](https://i.imgur.com/W3mlxOa.png) shows rapid acceleration in quarterly growth rate when adjusted for their earnings and market volatility.

**TLDR**: An improvement in future earnings growth, and a faster than expected full recovery is highly likely given their current trajectory of revenue return.   The new Sephora deal bringing positive/encouraging news, just before an expected Christmas retail run.  Investor sentiment is going to remain high and Nat King Kohl is about to bring Christmas joy to all of us.

&#x200B;

**PREDICTION:**

**KSS i**s about to flex towards pre-corona valuation levels in the next month of trading **(46.00+) (+15%)** and will continue on an upward climb to **55.00 (+40%) BY 12/2021**

**POSITIONS:**

**- 300 Shares @ 25.5**

**Shares will likely return +14-18% over the next 60 day trading window.**

[Options](https://i.imgur.com/wx2Mf5Y.png) **are extremely expensive right now due to the IV runup from last week, so look for a pullback or an overblown morning drop this week to enter anything before 1/8.**  Know that this play is safe so when the market starts tanking wait for your entry point

&#x200B;

**KSS 12/24 40c and 39c**

**KSS 1/8 40c**

**KSS 1/21/22  45c / 50c**

Godspeed retards, happy trading.  I am not going to load this up with rockets and space emojis because we're not immature children.  So instead, I leave you with some chart analysis

"Basic Small Money Plays For a This Wild and Crazy Market - IPO's, SPAC's, and New Tech; Oh My!",0.63,"**One big thing stands out to me in the ""recent"" market** that seems like an old concept being pushed hard again\*\*:\*\*

**Some new IPO's/SPAC's, or** just **companies** that have been **under the radar** and already passed over for what appeared to be better long term investments, **are going for modern or interesting sounding names and tickers**, that may intended **to boost interest in younger investors.**

**LISTEN HERE:**

**THIS IS SO OBVIOUS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY, NO SHIT SHERLOCK, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.**

**SO DO IT THIS TIME, IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY! BUY BEFORE THE MEME GETS SOMEONE RICH THAT'S NOT YOU!**

The **new tickers that move** are ones that **have things that make them sound cool,** and **that's** really **all that matters.** Usually the **name is catchy,** the **ticker is** often **easy to remember and** might even look like it should go that Porsche **you're going to** buy when it's **finally** your turn to **get** rich and post gain **porn.**

**LOOK: These tickers don't require as much fundamental quantification**, compared to some REIT named $LAME buying up closed down dollar general store locations, or something equally boring to talk about. It's all about marketing and perception.

**THE GAMBLE:** What **I suggest** is going **long** on **shares** when you see these particular types of stocks hit the market, especially if you're hearing people asking about them a lot, because if people are interested in crap only because the ticker, product, or company name sounds cool, you may have a winner.

**Typically,** **you want to see if there's a little dip first. If you're already in, this is not the time to sell and try to time re-entry.**  **Some IPO's don't allow shorting for a certain duration,** but that doesn't mean price cannot drop initially. Also, **not all IPO's will run options until a certain number of days have passed,** and there may be some wait before hype is prepared to move the stock, **so watch the option volume very closely and see if it begins to look liquid.** Take this time to consider if the stock will have some sort level of excitement in it, and attract attention. It should sound cool. Honestly, **it should be something that you might not buy yourself, but** you'd definitely **want to try it out or learn more about what the heck this** ticker **thing is** trying to sell if you weren't so lazy and it was free.

We have seen things with **names like LAZR** recently, **pumped by Cramer**, with ooooooo, maybe a military contract, and ahhhh, cool cameras that can probably spot people really far away.

**RKT**, because it even if it has reasonable fundamentals, you know it had to go up for a bit, **because it's named rocket...**

**NIO, PLUG, LI, FCEL, FLIR, PLTR** (I haven't even read the Lord of the Rings series and I know the reference), **TSLA, NKLA, ZooM**, and so forth. **Many** of these companies **doubled, trippled, or** went up even **more,** in very short periods.

Now, **some of those companies** have some value, and some do not, or certainly **not worth** what **their local maxima** will become, so you want to **get in cheap and early as hype begins,** but ***before any major price move***, **and then just wait for the gains and GTFO of the stock unless it's run by some incredibly weird entrapreneur that gets regular interviews on any damn show he wants.** So much of the market is over bought, that people will buy any piece of crap that sounds cool. That's it. That's all you need to know.

**First, I suggest getting the WeBull app**. A lot of people have it, whether that's their broker or not, because it does a few things right, but **mainly it's a convenient way to find out what IPO's may be coming up**. **RKT, PLTR, and many others were announced well in advance via WeBull,** and **if you have notifications on** for it\*\*, you'll get the ""memo""\*\* that some of retail is getting. Now **don't go buying every IPO.** You want to **look for a** **product that sounds like it has future potential**, something **not fully tapped into yet,** and the **company name must grab your attention**. You want **a name that sounds exciting and fast paced** to retail. Something that **if you said it at the dinner table,** or around friends, **would the name make people seem honestly interested?**

I have been sitting through this bull run, selling positions early, not going in on the companies I mentioned, using rational reasoning for why to buy a stock. This is not the time for being completely rational. Your investment accounts should be Boglerific, but **your play money needs to find a home in these types of stocks**, **take the large gain when it comes, and dump** the stock **before everyone else** does.

Buy long duration vertical calls if they're available, but **don't plan to hold longer than whenever the spike comes.** **Vertical spreads help reduce IV cost somewhat** (usually) as the two strikes will partially cancel out each others vega, so this lets you get in with a defined risk amount. Shares are still the safer way, as puts will likely be not liquid enough at first to sell bull put verticals, and IPO's like this are more likely to tripple in the first 6 months than they are to become 1/3rd.

**THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE, AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A STRATEGY MOSTLY FOR AN OVERBOUGHT MARKET WITH LITTLE ELSE TO PICK FROM.**

2020: Your Best and Worst Moves,0.85,"Was getting some traction on this in the weekend discussion thread so thought I’d start up it’s own thread...I’ll start -

Worst moves this year: buying SNOW shares at $250 and PLTR shares at $11 on IPO dates and daytrading instead of holding. Also getting bored of CRSR leaps at $20 and NET shares at $36 because “they weren’t moving.” PAPER HANDS. Guh.

Best moves: jumping in TSLA and SQ in June.

Just bumping a reply I made so more you can gain insight from it.,0.78,"Don't rely on TA alone. The market sentiment was weak this week because of the SaaS sector earnings risks and the desire of hedge funds to get in cheaper for a second December rally. HOHOHO.

Salesforce got hammered to create enough delta for a gap up back to $250+ for accumilation. 

Snowflake couldn't stay down and its valuation is absurd, approxiamtely the size of IBM.

Palantir will retest $30 and breakout, just because SNOW did. ($370s) It's up to 2.5X PLTR market capitalization with half the revenue and an operating loss of 14 million. These SNOW investors paid up early for next year 2022. All the Warren Buffett hype and it's paid for WallStreet IPO client/Brokerage PR bias shilling (even by Cramer who won't support PLTR because of the Direct Listing model as an ex-hedge fund manager)

Facebook's underwriters were Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Barclays and Allen & Co. - and they fucked Facebook with a botched roadshow and  didn't say anything meaningful to shore up its 16 month share price collapse. 

They were too busy being bearish on FB and probably shorted it themselves, especially Goldman Sachs. 

Peter Thiel is a Director on the Facebook Board and remembers what low value paying $350 million for IPO offers.

Thiel and Karp dumped very cheap shares on the first trading day to provide liquidity and Wall Street was (by law very neutral but with a bearish vibe with chicken little risky risky!!!) 

This company would have been IPO listed at $35 a share, still making it much cheaper than the Snowflake IPO. But you can't withhold Wallstreet its tendie tribute. Thiel took it directly to the exchange. 

Meme stock or not, I'm disappointed to see the lack of faith in this company because of a broad market shakeout. $21 was a great entry point, but people expect to realize their ideal oversold wet dream. The Germans are bullish still calling it the next Tesla fairy-tale story. Karp is phil-German and speaks fluently while studying in Frankfurt for years and considers it his cultural homeland. Thiel is German American. So was Wernher Von Braun...*cough Elon Musk the South African/Canadian of Dutch ancestory.

## NIO Recap

**0DTE Prediction you should have chosen from the last post:**

* *""If NIO breaks support at 44.06 ish or bounces off resistance at 47.85 ish, expect downwards PT of 44.03 - 38.53 and below.*
* *Play: 42p 12/04 exp or 43p 12/04 (only play in the morning)""*

## Today's Price Movements

**Monthly Prediction you should have chosen from the last post:** 

* *""If NIO breaks support at around 44.41, look for 37.32 by 12/7 - 12/9 and 35.97 by 12/8 - 12/14.""*
* *Play $30p 12/16 exp""*

&#x200B;

**Monthly Outlook**

On the 1D timeframe, NIO doesn't have support until 33.56. However, a pivot point sits at 40.54.

Theoretically, a pivot point is a price level used by professional traders to assess whether prices are bullish or bearish.

""If the prevailing market price is above the base pivot point, it suggests bullishness. If the market is below the base pivot, it suggests a bearish tenor.""

On 12/2, NIO reached through the pivot point and jumped back up, creating a long wicked heilkin ashi. Notice how the open and high prices are currently synched on the downtrend? Theoretically, this indicates a STRONG bearish momentum. 

The next support level on the 1D timeframe sits at 33.16

TSLA extended its uptrend support and has currently wedged itself into a rising wedge (bearish). 

&#x200B;

**12/7 Weekly Outlook**

Tesla needs a nice pop on Monday to the resistance of the rising wedge, which is right near the resistance level of 622.66. It exceeds that price, then the bearish wedge has failed, and TSLA's sentiment will be bullish.

# PLTR Recap

Weekly and Monthly Prediction you should have chosen from the last post *(I called it 0DTE on the last post. My mistake)*: 

* *If PLTR closes above 27.48, then look for a PT of 32.87 between 12/11 and 12/18.*
* *Play 34c 12/11 exp. or 34c 12/18 exp*
* *If PLTR breaks support around 22.86 the look for a PT of 21.22 - 16.02 between 12/11 and 12/18 (For some reason, I didn't include a position for this possibility. For next weeks prediction that will drop Monday morning, ill provide a prediction)*

&#x200B;

**Monthly Outlook**

PLTR is deciding whether to bounce off uptrend support or leap out. We will have a more precise direction at close on Monday. 

## Today's Price Movements

Liquidity question,0.85,"Been trading shares for several years, made some fun money. Made a bunch, lost a little.

NVAX @ $21 (still holding)
TSLA @ $291 (Post Split)
GME @ $4 (Sold WAY too soon)

I make good money, and have $100k or so that I play with in E*Trade.

I want to start losing everything on Options, but have some questions to make sure I do it as efficiently as possible:

How liquid are ITM options?

If I pick up some TSLA 12/31 $600c, and the stock touches $625, how quickly would I be able to dump the contracts?
is it as quick as with shares?

If I buy $600c contracts, but the price goes down, I’m out only the premium I paid right?
Conversely, if I buy $600p and the price goes up, I’m only out the premium?

It’s only if I “write” contracts that I’m obligated to buy or sell those shares.

Also, I seem to catch on to what you guys are suggesting a little late. I am usually looking at buying into whatever your talking about while it’s near the top (PLTR @ $27.60) What keywords should I be looking for in your retarded posts that will clue me in to what is going to happen before it starts moving?

The memes and kiddy investors think Intel is going down so the IV is low and premiums are at a good price. The bears are always wrong about tech stocks. They think intel is some kind of shitty company that doesn't have the worlds leading market movers invested in their success, I dont know maybe I'm wrong about their thoughts. I can't read their minds but I can read Intels press releases and figures.

News like this about AI, maybe it's not gaming performance but that's not what we are here to talk about:

> Why It’s Important: AI and analytics open new opportunities for customers across a broad range of industries, including finance, healthcare, industrial, telecom and transportation. IDC predicts that by 2021, 75% of commercial enterprise apps will use AI1. And by 2025, IDC estimates that roughly a quarter of all data generated will be created in real time, with various internet of things (IoT) devices creating 95% of that volume growth2.

They have their hands in Machine Learning, AI, neuroscience and self driving cars...

Our current big bets are memory, autonomous driving, and 5G.

I don't see any reason to logically remain skeptical of Intels consistent year to year performance and market adaptations.

Here are the necessary edits I had to include in the post that are responses to trolls, if anyone wants more info and meme defense: 

Edit because trolls:

Look at the greeks of the contract if you know how to read them. They are good for this strike price. 

It is a safe and profitable bet with the delta and vega ratings. A 10% increase in the underlying would put it past strike price and net several hundred % return on investment.

Correlation between Emerging Markets Index (EEM) and US Dollar (DXY) is Setting Up a Good Trade,0.82,"So, I was pretty bullish on **SLV** and **GLD** because of long-term weakness in the dollar, but without stimulus, it looks like there isn’t going to be much more movement this year. Instead, I’ve been looking at the correlation between **EEM** and the **DXY** and see a lot of potential for a big trade to close out the year. 

Just for some background:

**EEM (Emerging Markets Index)**: Consists of a basket of companies that are incorporated outside the US in developing nations – think China, India, Brazil, etc...

It’s top ten holdings are:

[EEM Holdings](https://preview.redd.it/nx6mof8ad5361.png?width=881&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2cc1453f40d835a0beb1cd8ead750071f2fb06b)

**DXY (Dollar Index):** A dollar weighted index that derives its value by weighing six different currency pairs against the dollar (USDX and DXY are the same thing):

USDX = 50.14348112 × EURUSD -0.576 × USDJPY 0.136 × GBPUSD -0.119 × USDCAD 0.091 × USDSEK 0.042 × USDCHF 0.036

It doesn’t perfectly capture the value of the US dollar, but for the purposes of this post, it’s good enough. 

**Thesis:** Based on historical data there is a clear negative correlation between the **EEM** and the **DXY**. 

[EEM Index vs. DXY Price Comparison](https://preview.redd.it/o9fpbjskd5361.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=34caf74258c9bf0b61f1eb7505620fcfef6f3d52)

[30-Period Rolling Correlation of the Daily &#37; Change in Price of EEM vs. DXY](https://preview.redd.it/ykx2sf8od5361.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8a4cd2a42141f6afce4ac0b5a5e3588066862ff)

Over the last \~15 years of price history, the correlation between the two indexes has been negative. There have been periods where the correlation reversed to the upside; however, those instances were rare and short-lived. Based on the data it's clear that the correlation is most negative succeeding the 2008 financial crisis with the introduction of QE and is sustained until 2012 when the **DXY** began to recover. There was also a short-lived negative correlation spike in 2016 (Donald Trump elected) and in 2018 (Trade War) - both the result of market volatility and a move out of equities and into USD. 

The **EEM** has never broken up above $55.00; however, given the massive headwind pushing the US dollar down, and the massive tailwind propelling nations like China, India, and others (or whatever), I'm willing to bet **EEM** breaks out above the $55.00 level in the next 3-6 months and pushes $60.00+ by the end of 2021.   

**Why:** A weaker dollar allows emerging market countries more freedom to provide fiscal stimulus without fearing negative implications for their own economies. For instance, an emerging market government might feel more comfortable with fiscal easing if its currency is rising, dampening the potential for an inflationary shock (there are other reasons, but I’m too lazy to list them all).

**Plan: EEM** is currently sitting at \~$50.80 as of this post, and the **DXY** is hovering around $0.9055. Based on some eyeballing “technical analysis”, it looks like the next level of support for the DXY is $0.8882. I’m also thinking that while stimulus might not happen this year, it’s basically guaranteed to happen in 2021. More stimulus should also help depress the US dollar. Also, the holidays are historically a good time for stocks and absent any (surprising) bad news, the market should melt up higher until Christmas. Lastly, the prices on EEM options are so cheap I’m fully erect even thinking about it.

Cinemark ($CNK) is Good and So Can You!,0.88,"What’s up fellow autists. I’ve been a lurker of this subreddit for a few years now and always enjoyed the content, the shitposts, the memes, and the rare DD’s. But this week, I’ve feeling for my fellow retards, especially those that gambled their 401k’s and Holographic Charizard Pokemon cards on $PLTR. Orders on $ROPE seem to be up BIGLY 🚀 over the past week, so I wanted to offer a bit of DD on an industry that you and your Netflix and Chill partner have become well acquainted with this year being stuck at home. At the very least, you owe it to your hand to hear me out about Cinemark ($CNK).

TLDR: $CNK 15 Jan 22, 20 Strike Bought Calls / $CNK 19 Mar 21, 12.5 Strike Sold Puts

So quickly, just to get this out of the way: I am a curator of shit. I originally started this reddit account several years ago because I got tired of playing shitty Super Mario Maker levels and had finally decided to make my own. Then, a year later, I was on a Pokemon kick and was desperately looking to trade Pokemon on my 3ds. It’s where I learned to sift through shitty trades and allowed my autism to truly flourish. You ever need a 5 IV hacked Japanese Ditto to get a perfectly spec’d egg? Do you have any idea what the hell I’m talking about? No, probably not. But I bring this up because when you’re willing look into the details so much for a fucking Pokemon, it only makes sense to use that same treatment for a financial investment. And just like Super Mario Maker, I got tired of seeing shitty trades and wanted to do something myself. So I went and studied markets and options the past four years and will likely try and make a career out of finance now.

But you’re here to learn about Cinemark. And here’s what you already know: Movie theaters have been absolutely crippled by Covid. That’s no secret. And just when vaccine news helps to get the likes of CNK and AMC back on their feet a bit, Warner Bros comes out yesterday and says they are moving all of their films to HBO Max. This announcement alone sent movie stocks tumbling as much as 20%.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/warner-bros-to-release-movies-on-hbo-max-threatening-theatrical-windows.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/warner-bros-to-release-movies-on-hbo-max-threatening-theatrical-windows.html)

To add insult to injury, AMC had already announced ANOTHER 200 million shares in a public stock offering THAT MORNING to raise money, with their CEO going on to threaten investors that AMC will go bankrupt without help. This probably isn’t the first time you’ve heard of a possible AMC bankruptcy either, especially if you’re a subscriber to this very subreddit.

[https://investorplace.com/2020/12/amc-stock-why-amc-entertainment-shares-sunk-16-today/](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/amc-stock-why-amc-entertainment-shares-sunk-16-today/)

And here is where I’m gonna start throwing some numbers at you. Because as awful as it is to threaten investors with the fear of bankruptcy, the reality is that AMC is in SERIOUS financial trouble. Pulled from TD Ameritrade, here’s a few numbers for you from their balance sheet (as of their earnings in Q3 2020):

Assets:

Cash/Cash Equivalents: $506 million

Total Current Assets: $609 Million

Prop./Plant/Equip, Net: $6,808 million

Total Assets: $10,876 million

Liabilities:

Current Accounts Payable/Accrued Expenses: $1,057 million

Total Current Liabilities: $1,588 million

Total Debt: $5,919 million

Total Liabilities: $13,246 million

So I know what you’re thinking: TLDR, StOp NuMbErs GiVe PoSiTiOnS ReTaRd. And I’ll get there, just like George R.R. Martin is getting to the end of the Game of Thrones series. But what is really important to see here is that for the CURRENT period that ends in one year, AMC has a deficit of $979 million ($1,588 million in current liabilities minus $609 million in current assets). And normally, when in such a situation, you generally have three solutions: go offer more stock; go sell some of your company; or, you take out loans with a creditor. AMC is doing the former with a stock offering. But why not go to a creditor and get a loan? Well, maybe it’s because YTD for Q1, Q2, and Q3, AMC has already drawn down a shit town of debt out just to cover their ass. Creditors likely will not be willing to finance this sinking ship much longer and AMC are in legitimate trouble.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/amc-could-run-out-of-cash-by-then-end-of-2020-company-warns.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/amc-could-run-out-of-cash-by-then-end-of-2020-company-warns.html)

So this brings me to Cinemark and their balance sheet. And it’s here I’ll give you a few more numbers from their Q3 2020 Balance Sheet:

Assets:

Cash/Equivalents: $826 million

Total Current Assets: $984 million

Prop./Plant/Equip, Net: $2,832 million

Total Assets: $5,803 million

Liabilities:

Accounts Payable/Accrued Expenses: $599 million

Total Current Liabilities: $624 million

Total Debt: $2,519 million

Total Liabilities: $4,796 million

So I’d like to immediately draw your attention to the current period for CNK. Due to their stronger cash position (which in fairness, has been due to financing this year as well), they have a net surplus of $360 million for the next 12 months. What’s more, they can cover ALL of their current liabilities with their cash position alone for the next year. This is to say that if you believe that the Covid will be behind us within a year and that movie theaters will at least by open back to full capacity, Cinemark has the financial strength to survive another year without any sales.

The next thing I’d like to bring to your attention is the SIZE of both companies. If you look at the Prop./Plant/Equipment for AMC and CNK, you’ll see that

AMC has $6,808 million in assets

CNK has $2,832 million in assets

AMC is the largest movie theater company in the world, and here, it shows. They are over twice the size of Cinemark in property alone, and their total assets are just over twice the value of Cinemark’s as well. So AMC does have quite a bit of market share on the movie theater industry. However, with AMC’s financial weakness and a looming threat of bankruptcy, here are some possible outcomes:

1. AMC goes bankrupt. They will have to reorganize their corporate structure and will likely lose some of their theaters along the way. Competitors may have the option to buy some of these theaters and AMC loses some of their market share which could be beneficial for CNK.
2. AMC looks to merge. This is true for the larger market as a whole, but with belabored businesses that are on the verge of bankruptcy, mergers and acquisitions look to be a huge market in the upcoming year. And while Cinemark doesn’t have the financial strength, on paper, to take on the massive debts the AMC currently holds, there is something to consider here in the numbers. If AMC is twice the size of Cinemark, Cinemark’s market share would increase by 3x on an outright acquisition of AMC (and that’s assuming they took on their debts as they stand today). Cinemark would more than double their debt in doing so, but CNK has also shown that they can manage their book better. They may see the added market share as a warrantable risk to take on.
3. AMC gets the funding it needs and survives in the short term. Cinemark isn’t really affected by this outcome.

Next, let’s consider the technicals of Cinemark. Cinemark was trading just above $30 before the great stock market fall back in March. It was trading as low as $5.71 at it’s lowest, and outside a one month period from the end of September to November 9th(vaccine news day), CNK was trading in a price channel that bottomed out around $10. With positive vaccine news and a rollout of vaccinations, it is likely that CNK will be able to open its doors again in the next six months. As such, there is a case to be made for CNK not breaking a fairly strong level of support moving forward.

The last part, admittedly, is a bit of my own opinion. But since the election and Pfizer/Moderna’s vaccine news, there has been a large shift in money across the markets. Specifically, money in the NASDAQ (Covid-proof) tech sector moved outwards towards other sectors, including stocks that were rightfully battered due to Covid. Retail, energy, and entertainment all saw large boosts with Covid relief. You don’t have to look much farther than stocks like Kohl’s (KSS), Nordstrom (JWN), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), Airlines (any of them), or cruise lines, all while watching tech largely stagnate (except for beloved meme stocks like Tesla and AMD, of course). Many of these are still trading below their pre-covid highs, and it is where I personally believe large, institutional money is moving and holding large portions of money. Sure, Covid cases are spiking at the moment and there is an argument to be made for the NASDAQ taking up arms again. But the stock market is a forward looking instrument and is now looking ahead to a point in time when Covid has been dealt with.

So to bring this all full circle, here is my TLDR for why Cinemark is a stock you should seriously consider looking into:

1. It has the financial strength to survive for at least another year, well past the point of covid vaccinations and a return to normalcy.
2. With AMC on the ropes, CNK could stand to benefit from an increase in market share if AMC does file bankruptcy. They could even pick up existing AMC theaters for significantly cheaper if such a corporate AMC structure were to occur.
3. While still trading below its pre-Covid highs (and for veritable reason), vaccine news and actual vaccinations only stand to help stocks in the entertainment sector (barring a failed vaccine, of course). And while Covid cases are certainly rising in the short term, because CNK has the financial backing to weather another year, it is a short term headwind that will likely be overtaken when vaccinations ramp up.

Positions? TLDR? Give yourself a year on this one. Buy a leap and leave it for a while. If you hate getting cucked by Theta decay, maybe sell some 10 or 12.5 strike OTM puts. That way, if you end up getting put shares, it’s of a stock you wanted long term anyway (and you got paid to get put into it). Premiums for such a volatile industry and very high right now and there is good money to be made in Theta and Vega.

CNK 15 Jan 2022 20 Bought Call: 4.00 (as of this writing)

CNK 19 March 2021 12.5 Sold Put: 2.40 (as of this writing). With a breakeven of 10.10, this puts you just above support if you do get put. If Cinemark is trading above $12.50 in 3 months time, this is a 19.2% ROI (or 6.4% a month), which is still a hell of a return (especially if you believe in the stock long term, like I do).

The difference between an autist and a retard,0.92,"Although I haven't been here for long, I've started to notice a certain dichotomy between two different types of WSB users. On one hand, there are the retards, and on the other hand there are the autists. Mind you, both retards and autists can gain money, and both retards and autists can lose money. The difference lies in how they do it. 

The retards are the public face of WSB and its most vocal cohort. Mind you, I'm not looking down on retards. I've made plenty of trades that can properly be described as ""retarted"" rather than autistic, like YOLOING my whole account on SPY puts and UXVY shares before the election. 

I've also learned quite a bit from the retards of this sub. The most important lesson has been not to be too uptight about money. After I blew up 70% of my account, my brain was telling me to get the hell out of the casino, but you all gave me the inspiration to pick up the pieces and YOLO them again. I've since recovered more than half of my Robinhood ""tuition."" 

But WSB's retards have also taught me what not to do. After NIO and PLTR rose precipitously most of November, many of you bought weeklies, and many of your portfolios (and the portfolios of your suggestible family members, coworkers, and friends) were decimated. It seems that buying calls at the peak of a long green run without any coherent thesis as to why the stock is still undervalued is not the way. ""Retard strength"" can move microcaps, but it can't move stocks with a float of more than a billion shares. Therein lies the difference between the retards and autists of WSB. 

The autists of WSB form their thesis before the run and before the retards have piled into their echo chamber. They might be early, but they are never late. There are a lot of super smart people on this sub, offering top-notch DD, but their voices are not always heard. Sometimes the memes come to life, and there's no longer any need to approach them rationally, but TSLA is the exception, not the norm. We've all been spoiled by the brilliance of its meme power, but that light can no longer lead us to Valhalla. We need to be smart, and put our faith in the true autists. 

There will always be the FDs that go up 5000% and the AAs that go up 600% when we meant to buy calls on AAL, but the law of averages dictates that the retards will lose. I may be a retard, and I have certainly lost, but I'm trying to turn it around. Who's with me?",2020-12-04 16:54:47

🚀 🚀 🚀 $ZUO to the Moon ($PLTR potential),0.82,"**Tl;dr: Zuora (ZUO) will double by Q1.**

* ZUO is a SaaS company like PLTR and enables subscription commerce for companies who want to transition their businesses from traditional one time transactions to Netflix-like recurring subscriptions.
* Recurring subscription are valued much higher by boomer shareholders (# PLTR), making ZUO an attractive play for every major company on the planet
* ZUO already transact $12B+ of annual subscriptions with massive growth rates
* Unlike PLTR, ZUO has been trading sideways since IPO two years ago and is currently near all time lows. Absolute bargain and can only go up from here! Very cheaply valued compared to nearly all other SaaS companies.

* **Just released an earnings and forecast beat, sending shares up 5.7% premarket. Closed biggest deal in history this quarter. Will keep beating earnings from here according to industry trend.**
* ZUO benefits from the global digitisation trend, which has been accelerated by the pandemic and is expected to further take-off in 2021. Most enterprise companies (massive total addressable market) are very early in their journey, but will eventually transition to recurring subscriptions which ZUO is uniquely positioned to support

What PLTR actually does (short version),0.94,"TL;DR Imagine the show Devs but without quantum computers


Some.background: I am a software engineer. I don't work at Palantir. This is all based on my own prior knowledge and things I have read in one of their user guides.

Here it goes.

Pretend I'm the NSA. I have many databases, containing things like ISP data, security footage, text messages, GPS data, voice recordings, credit card transactions, emails, public records, and satellite images. I need a way to connect my datasets to generate insight, which in the case of the NSA means spying on someone.

Palantir sells the software to do that. It works in multiple steps.

1) It uses my datasets to create a knowledge graph where the nodes are all people, places and things in the ""universe"" and the edges indicate their relationship. It's like a social network, but in addition to connections to my friends, family, and coworkers, there is also an edge connecting me to my phone, my home, my car, my preferred Wendy's, etc.

2) Using the connections in that knowledge graph, it can create a coherent and complete timeline for a given person by piecing together data points from my whole data ecosystem. This requires machine learning and AI to extract signal from unstructured data like images and text, and the use of pattern matching to de-annonymize data by linking it back to specific people.

The end result: Reconstructing a model of the past by connecting all data breadcrumbs left along the way, and then predicting the future based on past events.",2020-12-04 08:24:12

The Future Of Plastics,0.72,"Good Morning Degenerates,

&#x200B;

Welcome to today's History & Science Class. Today, we will be learning about plastics.

Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are renewably-derived polymers that are entirely biodegradable and compostable. As you may know, other polymers require industrial recycling to be broken down. Authentic tards may be familiar with the PHA firm Metabolix, now called Yield10 Bioscience, which sank millions of tendies a few years ago developing the same science. The market was not ready then - but now - This Is The Way.

If you haven't heard from the likes of Robert Downey Jr yet, then here's the present. We generate over 300 million metric tons of plastic - equal to the weight of the entire human population. You think electric cars and solar power are the only way to solve our problems and go green? Think again.

The PHA market is approximately 1% of the entire plastic market. The largest barrier for this emerging market is the cost of raw materials, and refinding said materials. With that, the inability to achieve economies of scales is the largest, and one of the only major restrictions on the market.

Now turn to Danimer Scientific. This company has been a leader in PHAs for years on years as a privately-run company. Now I'm only half-stupid so I'm not sure if any posts have been made about this, but the SPAC Live Oak Aquisition Corp ($LOAK) has a definitive merger agreement with Danimer Scientific, providing $200 million in equity of the $890 closing equity valuation. Danimer Scientific is anticipated to go public as early as the end of this year, or early 2021.

What's this? Too good to be true? You heard me right, bitch. You better steal every last dime from your wife's boyfriend's wallet, because this is the future. One's first thought might be, "" Well, if this failed before, who's to say it yields now?""

Hear ye, motherfucker. Think:

\-Green New Deal

\-Net-zero emissions and carbon neutrality

\-Global Paris Agreement

&#x200B;

Danimer already has deals with the likes of Coca-Cola, Columbia, and Nestle. With the current deals they have, they are already at capacity. The funding secured from the merger, private investors, etc. will provide the necessary funding to develop another factory. With the funding already secured, they are prepared to increase production capacity 10x by 2025, thus increasing scale and profitability. The company has only around 20 million in debt, and has the growth potential of fucking Apple or Tesla. I will pour my life savings into this just to prove that I am right. I'll see you on the other side bitches.

&#x200B;

If you do any DD on PHAs you'll find Danimer right in the Top 5 of the global list. If you want to waste your tendies on PLTR and NIO calls I don't give a shit, but this is the future.",2020-12-04 05:50:51

PLTR Still The Best INVESTMENT Money Can Buy,0.7,"Hey so I did an analysis to find underpriced stocks and when I extrapolated all the variables I realized PLTR might be the most under priced stock on the market. Its a heavy weight with a light weight price.

When you realize that its comparable to the other tech giants and its only $24!!!!! You realize that price is a steal. You don’t even have to buy options, you can just buy stock and watch your money triple by summer. It’s an investment.

Here are my reasons:

•It will eventually be an operating system ( like Microsoft :[Link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&.tsrc=fin-srch) )

•It is backed by a billionaire

•It is backed by the US government

•This entire community loves the stock(mostly very rich people)

•They just signed a $300 million dollar deal… it’s on the website, is that reflected in the financials?If it is not, then I think the price needs to go up to adjust for that (asking not telling)

•This presentation is amazing: [https://s26.q4cdn.com/381064750/files/doc\_financials/2020/q3/Palantir-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation-1.pdf](https://s26.q4cdn.com/381064750/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Palantir-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation-1.pdf)

•The company is expanding at extremely rapid pace.

I recommend buying the stock. I am not a fan of hype for the sake of hype. I bought before the hype and I still believe in it now. ",2020-12-03 15:14:06

Actual Yolo.,0.7,"I know this is been a hotly debated and polarizing topic here. But the fact of the matter is there is just too much smoke for there not to be fire. I have seen a lot of ""yolo"" posts about this ticker that are 95% in the stock.... when you have a floor of 25% downside risk I don't think that qualifies as a yolo, more just an asymmetrical investment and probably a smart move in a volatile market.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVfS0vtH6mc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVfS0vtH6mc)

This video pretty much outlines why it's a safe bet and a sound investment.

but that's not why I'm here. This has been a long time coming.

Let me start by saying that I got into ""investing"" years ago with a couple hundred bucks just fucking around on E\*TRADE spending $7 to buy $25 worth of stock only to find out it was $7 to sell it. Later on, I found out about an app called Robinhood that was made for window licking retards like myself. It was glorious, I could day trade up to 3x in one day before I lost everything and got locked out of my account for a week. I enjoyed it greatly.

Then on December 23rd 2019 I saw an article on Marketwatch about how Draftkings was going public thru a SPAC. I didn't know what the fuck a SPAC was but it was just days before Christmas so I had a couple days off to research it. I took the couple hundred bucks in my account and I bought all the $DEAC I could get my hands on. Since then I have found this sub with other degenerate gamblers and retards like myself. Between the success of $DEAC / $DKNG, $PLTR, and $TQQQ (and others I can not mention) I managed to turn that 2K into over $80,000

I have been following the $PSTH saga thru infamousbreadfruit AKA Yolocapitalinc on twitter, since early October...

The Jackie Reses situation is just too coincidental. She previously she spent seven years handling mergers and acquisitions at Goldman Sachs, the works at the Head of Square Capital for 5 years, then joins the board of $PSTH, then goes on Twitter and ""liked"" a picture of the Stripe logo... v sus if you ask me...

The recent influx of videos to hit twitter have the story

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqrpbMQVWS8\&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqrpbMQVWS8&feature=youtu.be)

I don't come on here much to be honest but there's also some good DD that has been posted in the past that is easily accessible. Anyways I know I am going on and on but the point is I am going all fucking in.

I recently refinanced on my house to get a great rate and decided to take some cash out to ""invest""...

I'm taking the 80K profit this year from that other shit, throwing the cash out from the mortgage (20K) into half option calls, half shares on $PSTH. Yolo is relative. I basically live paycheck to paycheck and this is well over a year's salary.

“Palantir Tried Buying Morgan Stanley's Stake in Value Feud
By Lizette Chapman  and Sonali Basak

Bank’s mutual funds have repeatedly cut value of small holding
So Palantir sought to buy it back at lower price, people say
Silicon Valley startups sometimes bicker with their investors, but tensions between Peter Thiel’s Palantir Technologies Inc. and Morgan Stanley’s mutual funds are reaching a breaking point.

The banks’ funds have cut their valuation of a minor stake in the secretive data-mining company several times in the last two years, estimating the company’s worth at just $4.4 billion as of September 30. That’s well below the appraisal of several other investors in the firm and just one-ninth the valuation Morgan Stanley’s own bankers predict the company could fetch in an initial public offering.”",2020-12-03 02:20:52

$YY = TikTok + OnlyFans,0.51,"Greetings fellow autists. Y'all remember Marie Kondo? Japanese woman that gets off to cleaning people's shit up for them? Only keep things that spark joy? Fuck yeah. Well, with all you retards losing money by being balls long PLTR, I figured it was time to help you Marie Kondo your own portfolio. Let's tidy that shit up and spark some fucking Joyy.

Yes I spelled Joyy with two y's. And no big brain, that wasn't a typo. **Joyy ($YY) is your next one-way ticket to the goddamn moon.** Can you do basic math? Great. Neither can I. Do you get slightly aroused at the mere sight of a woman with a pulse? Of course you do. I myself just went six to midnight typing that out. Do you like losing money in the stonk market? Clearly. But I'm here to try to change that.

Congrats on making it this far. Let's get started!

$YY is the largest live-streaming platform you've never heard of. **It's like if TikTok merged with OnlyFans and was a publicly traded stonk**. I'll wait while you buy a few shares on that premise alone.

But it gets better. Much better. Joyy operates two live-streaming services, one is called YY Live and its getting sold to Baidu for $3.6bn. **The other is called Bigo Live and it's one of the top 10 apps in the world with revenues growing more than 130% y/y.** Many of the videos on Bigo are of hot Asian women live-streaming themselves dancing. Nice.

That's still not even the best part though. Galaxy brain question: would you rather pay full price for something or get something at a discount? What if you could get it for close to free? Well, at YY's current price, you're nearly getting Bigo Live for free. Please consult a doctor if you have an erection lasting for more than four hours.

How can that be? This part requires some remedial math skills that you and I both don't have, but alas, we must soldier on.

YY currently has $2.8bn in net cash on their balance sheet. Woah! I didn't know this was a fucking advanced accounting class. Well it is. Stay with me. We also know YY is going to get $3.6bn in cash from Baidu for the sale of YY Live. Lastly, YY is an investor in a company called HUYA that is valued at $750mm.

So... $2.8bn plus $3.6bn plus $750mm is? No, not $420.69 you retard. Try again. It's $7.1bn. Feel free to sit down and drink a sip of water if your head is spinning from all these numbers.

Compare this $7.1bn to YY's current market cap of $7.8bn. $7.8bn minus $7.1bn for everything that isn't Bigo Live is $600mm. There you have it. That's the implied value the market is giving to Bigo Live.

Holy shit right? To quote the great David Byrne from Talking Heads: [you may ask yourself](https://youtu.be/5IsSpAOD6K8?t=69)...

* Didn't Baidu just pay $3.6bn for YY Live?
* And isn't Bigo Live growing 130%+ while YY Live is barely growing?
* And aren't Bigo Live and YY Live about the same size at $1.8bn in revenues?
* And finally – you may ask yourself – if Baidu is willing to pay $3.6bn for YY Live, shouldn't Bigo Live be valued way the fuck more than that?

**The answer to all of these questions is fuck yes.** Bigo Live should be valued way higher than $600mm but you retards are too busy jacking off and losing money on PLTR to figure it out.

**The other great part about YY is we get to fuck some bears on our way to the moon**. I cannot expressly condone nor condemn the actual fucking of bears, but I can condone the fucking of some short sellers. Muddy Waters just released a short report on Joyy and short sellers piled in like the dumbass lemmings they are. How did YY respond to the short report you may ask? **By giving MW the double middle finger and increasing their dividend by $200mm.** Do frauds usually do that? Hell no they don't.

That's how you fucking spark Joyy in your portfolio!",2020-12-02 23:43:29

Which made a lot of sense so I picked up a few puts Monday a little after open when it was up about $4.50 at its peak around $50 so they ended up being super cheap. This worked out pretty good so when it spiked back up a little Tuesday I added closer to the money puts to my position. Which has paid off since they are down about 20% in the past 2 days.

 But I just wanted to take a minute and thanks u/maxprtr for his DD that was un related to the memes and look forward to seeing any of your future plays.

Bullish Abandoned Baby on PLTR,0.89,"Time to test Day Trader theories on Candledick charts. Hope you got your  calls cheap EoD today and you didn't paper hand over the past week. We all know nothing goes up in a straight line, especially meme stocks. TSLA has 30% swings to the downside in the past year but is up hundreds of percent. If you look at pretty much any candlestick chart for a meme stock that is currently orbiting the moon you will see this pattern arise.

For those of you too retarded to read Investopedia, this signal is typically a 3 day down trend followed by a down gaped Doji day. A Doji is when a stock opens and closes at approximately the same price with less volatility than normal. This is that. Additionally, if you look at the volume it is up as sales, but the price is constant. This signals that whoever is buying is holding or putting in high limit orders.

$30 by 12/10, possibly end of week.

I too painted my dick to look like a rocket ship docking with my wife's boyfriend's rocket ship once a month when he lets me.

The difference is that **I'm not 10 years old.**

It is [SCIENTIFICALLY proven](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-time-seem-to-speed-up-with-age/) that time literally moves faster for children; their heightened metabolism means that they do more biological functions (heartbeats, breaths) per minute compared to adults. Time literally seems to move slower for children because they DO MORE from moment-to-moment on a physiological level.

So before you yell at someone for their inability to understand that the end of the calendar doesn't mean we have **run out of days**, just remember:

On the other side of that keyboard is a cold, frightened teenager with bags of frozen chicken tenders he cannot eat, because his oven doesn't come with a 🚀 button.

PLTR downgrade,0.86,"So Keith Weiss, William and Mary graduate decided that good old MoStan needs a position in everyone’s favorite meme stock PLTR. In his reasoning behind the downgrade he said that “relative to their peers they are trading at an extraordinary multiple.”

I need us to combine our autistic powers (think like retard strength but with brain power)and figure out who he was talking about?

Down 91% 💎 ✋ PLTR,0.86,,2020-12-02 19:34:16
You have to know when to pull out (even if you never do),0.96,"So much loss porn today, on a day when the market is more or less flat. Why? Because of all of the PLTR bag holders. Yeah, some of you bought horrendously OTM short-term calls, sure, but some of you were people looking at 400% gains and you held because PLTR to the moon.

I keep seeing a lot of advice posts in here that are all great even if none of you retards are actually following that advice, but one more big piece here. I keep seeing people arguing with intense (and unearned) confidence that stock X will keep going up even though it's already gone up 559% in 6 months, stock Y (usually Tesla lol) kept going up when it was up 690% (see what I did there). But guess what fuckers, these are two different cases.

I know we're all autistic in this sub but people need to have exit strategies. You have to recognize that you've already landed on the moon. When you're sitting on a 400% gain on a very risky run-up, it's extremely unrealistic for there to be no sort of pullback *even if the long-term thesis is still intact*. People are out here playing the lottery but you already fucking hit the lottery if you hit on 400%. Guys, the average return on stocks is roughly 8% historically (when you account for inflation). 400% is like 50x that. Yeah it's cool to post 10,000% gains and shit but you know what else is cool? Walking away with a big gain and not having to be the bottom bitch to the homeless guy who you share the dumpster behind wendy's with.

Loss porns were funny but I keep seeing ""lost my life savings"" or ""gambled on significant margin"" or ""i used student loan payments for this"" and it's really bumming me out. So either start using what little brain cells you have or at least leave out the context because I want to laugh at you without feeling bad.

Why GME earnings has me worried,0.82,"The biggest reason I am worried about GME is the amount of paper hands in retail. Most of you in GME like meme stocks like PLTR, and look at how that one turned out when ONE Shitron article came out. If earnings causes any sort of dip (since the 12/8 earnings don’t include the PS5 sales), then we could see the downfall of our beloved stock. I’m not going to paper hands, but am considering sell the day before and buying the dip after, unless someone can give me a legit reason why this earnings call could trigger it to go up somehow.",2020-12-02 18:48:13

So you bought NIO and PLTR calls....what to do now.,0.8,"You are an idiot. But you know that. Your wives BF won't even give you knucks anymore. Hopefully you didn't completely wreck your account. What you need to do now is be smart about how you make your tendies back. There will be a few of you retards who get lucky with some FD's and make it back in two days but thats not going to work for all of you. 

What you need to do now is have a plan and know it might take a bit longer. IF you still believe in either of these companies, I mean actually have good understanding of their business and potential catalysts over the next 3-6-9 months then you should reposition into longer dated calls. You will have a good shot to make most of your money back. But it will take time. Don't hold onto your current piece of shit contracts. They are most likely going to 0. Also consider buying some stock. Again wont pay immediately but these companies can still do 100% moves over a relatively short period (6-12 months) or even faster. 

If your butt hole hurts so bad from this beat that the sight of NIO and PLTR gives your hemorrhoids then it's time to do the above strategy into a new ticker all together. Again don't sit on losers too long. If you can extract value do it, but have a plan before you sell anything. 

Anyway, I'm sure you all bought more FD's and will go bust by Friday. So DM me your wives number so I can take her out to Chili's and get a handjob in the bathroom.

edit: Yes retards NIO is up today but unless you timed the dip perfectly your options are down. Also this move is most likely a dead cat. To protect yourself from a longer dip you need to get further out.",2020-12-02 18:42:55

"Why ARNT we talking about PFE ""Pfizer"" to TENDIE TOWN",0.85,"serious question.. PFE or Pfizer is one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies and ranked 57 on the 2018 [Fortune 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500) list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue. They have a 226.2 BILLION dollar market cap.

They make  Lipitor which all of us probably need after yoloing our life savings into PLTR.They also make a drug our wife's boyfriends routinely dont need -Viagra

But the biggest question I have... why arnt we riding PFE to TendieTown.They literally are a massive pharma company with experience dealing in international regulations..Theyve partnered with BionTech and just got APPROVAL to use their COVID VACCINE IN THE UK NEXT WEEK

[https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55145696](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55145696)

Literally even Delta is riding their wave back to life  and have altered flights to deliver their vaccine by storing it in dry ice.

Moderna went up 70% to 170$ and only dipped because of serious profit taking because Merck cashed out at like a 650% gain (i think i saw they made over a billion in gainz)

PFE and Moderna are safe bets. PFE a safer bet. Look at headlines. Literally the governors of California and North Carolina have already said how thankful and blessed they are that they are getting a few hundred thousand vaccines from Pfizer and Illinois is about to follow suit.

PFE literally has a meeting for vaccine drug approval with the FDA on December 10.They are experienced, they are financially secure, and they are already making and distributing the vaccine. UK already approved their vaccine, the FDA will follow suit and PFE will make us serious money.

Im all in with my small account.25 contracts at 45$ strike price with an expiration date of 12/18 and40.5c 12/11

* If SPY holds current support, expect a bounce out of the falling wedge and look for a price target of 367.49+
* If spy breaks out of the rising wedge that bean forming on 11/30, expect it to fall between 364.20 - 363.23 - 361.52 depending on its exit point.

SPY finally jumped out of its consolidation channel from 11/24.

SPY jumped to .71% from the consolidation channel or .29% from the bottom price target.

[Here's an excerpt from two posts ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3cydq/spy_recap_nio_amd_and_tsla_ta_or_a_wsbs_wet_dream/):

>""Monday will be the start of SPY's 4th day of consolidation, so something has to give IMO, but she could consolidate on Monday, so watch out for pump fakes. You may want to extend the consolidation channel to be safe. However, if SPY breaks out, expect a 1-2% movement in either direction, as highlighted below.""

&#x200B;

On the daily chart, if SPY can get to 366.29 - 372.50 and find support, the w-shaped recovery will be in play, and you could play a lotto380c and watch spy get to 381.90 - 398.03.

* If NIO holds current support and breaks the falling wedge, it could make its way to 47.71 -48.95. The first test will be 44.84 ish and 47.71 ish.
* If current support fails, look for NIO to drop to 43.27 ish. If it busts through that, then look for 41.48 and below.

# 12/1 Recap and 12/2 Possibilities or Is AMD on Santa's Nice List?

AMD slid out of its uptrend from 11/30 and traded sideways today. It opened at 92.25 and dropped to 90.78 (the low for today), and recovered. AMD closed at 92.63.

*If AMD breaks support on its uptrend channel, expect a 3% drop. If it breaks at 92.16 ish, then expect a drop to 89.18 ish.*

AMD touched 90.81 or -2.08% and then bounced and consolidated for a bit at its bottom for the day. The price target was off by 1.63.

* If AMD holds current support and breaks current resistance on its downtrend channel, it could make its way upwards to 93.86 - 94.24 - 94.77. The primary test for this possibility will be 92.72.
* If AMD breaks support and bounces off downtrend resistance, expect movement downwards to 91.27. Expect a bounce around that price target BUT if it fails, look for 90.64 and below.
* If AMD bounces at around 91.27, then look for 92.55 ish near the top of the resistance. 92.55 will be a significant test. Look for a breakout at that PT. Again, if it punches out ook for 93.06 - 93.87 - 94.24.

Top 5 Tips Every Noobie Trader MUST Know.,0.98,"Been awhile since I made a post educating you retards, throwing pearls before swine. I've been disheartened by some of the comments I've read recently and just wanted to provide some tips for the genuine noobies/retards among us. If you already know this shit, congrats, move along sir.

Take a look at my previous, more advanced guide to some theta gang theory for those looking for something a bit more in depth: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how\_to\_consistently\_outperform\_the\_sp500\_using/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how_to_consistently_outperform_the_sp500_using/)

Without further ado... TOP 5 TIPS Every Noobie Trader MUST Know.

# 1) You MUST understand Implied Volatility.

I made this the first point because it is the gigantic mistake I see noobies here making again and again. I'm talking to you, people who bought calls on PLTR at $30.  **If you learn anything from this post, you MUST learn this.**

You see a stock make a massive move either up or down. Your immediate response is ""this is a great opportunity to buy calls/puts on a volatile stock!"" Right? WRONG!

In fact, when a stock has just made a massive move in either direction, that is perhaps the WORST time to purchase options in EITHER direction. Options are not stupid. Options are designed to price in the fact that a stock is moving wildly. This is called ""implied volatility."" They become more expensive as a stock makes more dramatic moves, to price in the volatility you and everyone else is expecting.

It's quite possible and even likely that you buy an option on a high IV stock, and the stock moves in your direction, and yet you LOSE money, because it didn't move as dramatically as was expected by the implied volatility. **This is called ""IV crush.""** It only takes one or two experiences with IV crush for most traders to learn this lesson for life. If you understand this concept before you lose a ton of money, all the better.

**So, what should you do if a stock is highly volatile and options are expensive due to IV?**

There are two choices: Trade actual shares, or SELL the options rather than buy them.

If you are bullish on a high IV stock, you can take a bullish position by SELLING a cash-secured put rather than buying the call. If you are bearish on a high IV stock, you can take a bearish position by SELLING a call rather than buying a put (although this entails greater risk and will typically require higher options trading level by your broker).

# 2) You MUST have patience.

It's a tale as old as time. A noobie investor does some research, reads some DD, and is convinced a stock is going to rise over the next couple years. So he buys in. A bad day or two hits and the stock tanks. He panics, and sells. The next couple days the stock rises and appears to stabilize. So he buys back in again, because he still believes in his thesis. The stock drops again, and he panic sells again.

In reality the stock is just trading sideways, but this idiot keeps buying on green days and selling on red days. This is perhaps the most idiotic, suicidal strategy anyone could ever employ. Buying on green and selling on red is a surefire strategy to lose money consistently over time.

This is why you MUST remove your emotions from your trades, because your emotions will usually tell you to buy on green and sell on red, literally buy high and sell low. As the boomer Warren Buffett once stated: **""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""**

Here is a better approach. Set up your entire trade BEFORE you make the trade. Have a set price you will sell at if things go south. Have a target price you will sell at if things go well. Once the dust settles you can learn from any mistakes. Were you too aggressive, or too conservative in your targets? What emotions directed you to make those mistakes? Too much greed, too much risk aversion, too LITTLE risk aversion? Make every trade a learning opportunity.

# 3) You MUST understand ""Reversion to the Mean.""

In general, stocks will tend to revert to their trendlines.

This thesis is fairly simple. If a stock moons 10% in a day, the most likely event is a drop the next day. If a stock tanks 10% in a day, the most likely event is a rise the next day. This is because humans are emotional creatures. First, they overreact to big news. Next, one of two things happen: When the stock is way up, people see it as a profit taking opportunity, so they sell. When the stock is way down, people see it as a buying opportunity, so they buy.

I don't have any hard data to back up this thesis, but I'm sure there's a bunch of nerds out there with hard data that proves exactly this, as well as trading algorithms specifically designed for a ""reversion to the mean"" strategy that are consistently profitable.

Obviously there will be exceptions, as well as times when a big move signals a shift in the trendline. All I am saying is in the MAJORITY of cases, reversion to the mean will occur. Don't go chasing stocks that have made massive short-term swings in a single direction unless you have strong reasons (not just hopes) to believe the trend has changed.

# 4) You MUST not YOLO your account more than once (or twice).

This is going to be controversial for some of you. But it's just straight math. If you keep betting your entire account, or close to it, on single trades, **it's only a matter of time before you go broke. That is a mathematical guarantee.**

Let's say you are one of the most skilled, intelligent, informed investors on the planet (doubtful). So skilled your plays are 90% correct. If you bet your entire portfolio on each trade, you are still expected to go completely broke after around 10 trades.

Let's say you aren't a brilliant stonk gambler. Let's say you are just average and your trades are a coin flip (which is generous for a lot of you retards). **If you bet your entire bankroll on each bet, on average you will go completely broke in just 2 trades.**

Again, there is a lot of complicated math we can go through to predict account explosion times and optimal bet sizing and so on, but that isn't necessary here. Professional gamblers such as poker players have refined bankroll management theory, which usually means at the least they aren't putting more than 10% of their cash on the table in one sitting, usually closer to 5%. (Take a look at the ""Kelley criterion"" for an interesting read: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly\_criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion))

I know a lot of you are broke with no life prospects and hoping to get rich quick. I don't fault you for that, I get it. The problem arises when you see the people who got insanely lucky with guessing 10 coin flips in a row who turned $1000 into $1,000,000, and hope to do the same... **but for every one retard with a record like that you've got hundreds more who lose it all and have nothing to show for it.**

I won't fault anyone for making a gigantic, life-changing bet a single time. That is your choice to make, and it just might pay off. But if you think you are going to do that again and again and survive, you are delusional.

# 5) You MUST be Skeptical... of EVERYTHING.

Fools and their money are soon parted. Don't be a fool.

Your first instincts when hearing ANYTHING should be skepticism. Your friend has a hot stock tip? Start with skepticism. Some online DD on a meme or penny stock online sounds convincing? Start with skepticism. A highly respected financial or government agency gives future guidance on whatever... again, start with skepticism.

There are a million people out there trying to take advantage of you, to pump and dump you, to scam you, to trick you into spending more money on whatever.

There are times when being a conformist pays off, like when markets rally for months straight. There are times when being a contrarian pays off, like when markets tank and sectors collapse. Don't be a consistent conformist nor a consistent contrarian. Be skeptical of every thesis and every hypothesis you hear, or even the ones you invent yourself.

When you take this approach honestly and still become convinced of a thesis, you have a higher probability than most of being correct.

**Seek out opinions that contradict your biases, not opinions that confirm your biases.** This is incredibly difficult and goes against human nature, but if you can achieve this ideal, you will out-trade 90% of the public.

GME breakout imminent = short squeeze imminent = tendies imminent,0.95,"I can't DD better than this (I can't even DD at all besides reading other DDs):

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4csaa/the\_real\_greatest\_short\_burn\_of\_the\_century\_part/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4csaa/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century_part/)

But one interesting thing is just to highlight a section of this DD that actually fulfilled today as promised:

**4) TA - When the stars and crayons align. Here’s an excerpt from our resident astrologist** [u/JayAreW](https://www.reddit.com/u/JayAreW/)**:**

>Ignoring the short squeeze element of GME and just looking at chart action, there are two elements that are important to keep track of. The cup and handle pattern and $15.80.While my trading style is 90% technical analysis, there are certain elements which I shy away from – mainly chart patterns. However, it is important to at least recognize the obvious ones because if you see it, chances are others see it too. The main pattern I keep an eye out for are the massive cup and handle patterns. This is an example from Pring [figure 1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103438112030760/cup_and_handle_pring_fig_1.PNG).The buy signal is traditionally a breakout above the handle, and a good estimate for price target is the distance from the base of the cup to the handle, added to the breakout point. A recent example of this is \[redacted\][(daily - figure 2)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103467937988628/jmia_cup_and_handle_fig_2.PNG). Notice not one, but two failures to break the top of the handle and the subsequent parabolic run. Compare \[redacted\] with $GME and you see almost the same pattern [(daily – figure 3)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103497926082580/gme_cup_and_handle.PNG). The traditional buy signal would be a breach above the red line (\~$15.80). The difference between \[redacted\] and $GME is that \[redacted\] was far more condensed; the pattern played out over a period of a few months where $GME’s cup and handle started in late 2019. Playing this pattern exclusively, I would expect a price target of roughly $27, stretched out over a period of weeks/months and not as explosive as it’s African counterpart (assuming a squeeze doesn't happen between now and then). Typically, any chart pattern calls for a retest of the breakout point, so don’t be surprised if $GME retraces to $15.80 and look for a bounce there as confirmation that the breakout is on. The other important element is the $15.80 price. Not only is it the breakout point for the cup and handle pattern, but it coincides to a price point which I believe was a major short-selling entry point [(fig 4)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103538602442812/GME_big_short.PNG). Notice the nearly 20% gap down on 33 million of volume. This type of action doesn’t just happen with selling alone and I believe massive short positions were opened on that day.This $15.80 then represents a breaking even point for those shorts if they have not closed their positions (and we have no real reason to believe they have). Breaking even is a huge psychological barrier for people when a trade isn’t going their way and often times represents an exit point for crowded positions. Most of the shorts were already underwater - above $15.80 and that water begins to boil. I believe this position is becoming borderline untenable for existing short positions and is a crowded and disastrous trade. So to recap, $15.80 not only serves as an important chart pattern breakout point, but the proverbial “line in the sand” for existing short positions.

Extreme TL;DR = Current cup and handle pattern of GME means if there is a bounce at $15.80, that means breakout is imminent.

And lo and behold, what do we see? The markets ended at $15.80 on the dot, and the afterhours pricing is already back up to $15.92, as foretold by [u/JayAreW](https://www.reddit.com/u/JayAreW/).

What will happen when there is a breakout? Apparently through TA our resident prophet figured out the breakeven point for short sellers is $15.80, and if GME passes the test at the $15.80 support level and begins to climb again, short sellers are gonna start panicking and start buying back share en masse, which will drive the short squeeze. Ooorrrrrr, they can short even MORE to try and squash the price down, but come earnings report on Dec 8th, if either the report was better than expected, or if Cohen, the dude who built a billion dollar fucking dog food company, does a hostile take over for GME due to less than stellar reports, again, that's a catalyst for the stocks to go up, leading again to short sellers getting fucked if they don't start buying back shares.  


If we autistic fucks can see this and figure this out, then FOR SURE the institutions and investment firms who shorted GME can see this and figure this out too. So their move is to keep shorting and not break the line as a whole and hope that we bow out and panic sell. And what are we waitinf for? We're waiting for the firms to panic, break rank, and start to buy up shares to cover their puts. So literally this situation is like two armies staring at each other, each waiting for the other to break their line first and turn tail and run. IT'S A FUCKING WESTERN SHOW DOWN. 

That is why, for all you paper hand mofos, literally stop it. Stop it. Stop selling and HOLD FOR AT LEAST A MONTH YOU PANSY BITCHES! Don't you realize the investment firms are scared, fund managers are gonna get fired if the short squeeze happens, so they're doing everything in their power to keep prices down by shorting, wanting cause fear among average joe retail investors like us? This is the wealth transfer from the 1% back to the common people we've been waiting for! If ONLY y'all don't bitch out and stand the line strong! Just be patient and if calls are too risky, just fuking buy shares then! Then you can factor out the risk of time and just enjoy the tendies at the end of the month!

Lastly, just like what Citron did to PLTR, plain old market manipulation by publishing a bogus report and price target on PLTR and taking money from all the paper hand bitches here, I'd expect desperate boomer firms to try some equal bullshit in scaring you all to selling. Just expect it to come and HOLD DAMN IT. This is the short squeeze opportunity of a lifetime, and you get to be part of history, and one day you'll be able to tell your grandkids how you fucked up, missed the $500 peak cuz you got too greedy, and sold it at $60 instead.

TL;DR = GME, Tendies, Moon.

SUMO - Going Belly Up,0.84,"As you regret your post Turkey day belly gains, let me give you a bit of insight into SUMO. I've started a medium sized position and am expecting this to go belly up over the coming weeks. Hoping y'all can get in before the run-up is too late.

**My Positions**:

https://preview.redd.it/j4y6eiguwn261.png?width=1059&format=png&auto=webp&s=d69345e8adbae2e1bc707664b1a453fb3a63641f

**Background**:

SUMO is a cloud based analytics platform that enables clients to summarize their data and provide extra security. Think of it as a mini-PLTR with a focus on cyber security and issue management. They IPO'ed on Sept 17.

As far as their product goes - it plays well with all major products including AWS, GCP, and Azure. That speaks to their client base, which ranges from Pokemon Go to Airbnb, but includes whales like $BUD and $DAL - any company who values data and cyber security is in play.

[Financials](https://investor.sumologic.com/static-files/ede9f243-bb20-40a3-b3e9-d60835488125) look good - they've grown 50% YOY for the past few years with extremely low large customer contributions (2100+ customers). Revenue is $155m, which is like .0001% of the cloud security/analytics market share ($50b TAM). All revenue is recurring, and all clients are locked into multi-year deals when they sign. Clients don't seem to churn, and are in fact increasing their revenue spend as the contract goes on.

They do have significant competition in companies like DDOG ($550m in Rev / $30b in market cap), SNOW ($400m in Rev / $90b market cap), and CRWD ($480m in Rev / $33b market cap) vs their $155m in Rev and $2.6b in market cap. Institutions are starting to grab shares - 60% institutional ownership and climbing fast. 

**Research**:

They break their business into 3 tiers: Small, mid, and enterprise market. They have 70+ openings (\~ 10% of headcount), with a focus on Enterprise and Sales positions, which would indicate they are expecting high growth and a focus on larger clients. 

They've projected slower growth rates into Q1 and Q2 of 2021 at about 25-30%, which caused their stock price to fall off when they IPO'ed (since recovered). However, they are also projecting much lower costs, which will lead to higher margins and profit.

Recent reviews on Glassdoor haven't been friendly, granted most tech companies let go lots of people with COVID and those employees need a forum to express frustration. Their new leadership seems focused on growth and the IPO, which may not be fun for most employees, but will be good for profit margins.

**Play/TLDR**:

Earnings is Dec 7. Buy shares and sell covered calls to grab high premiums for Dec earnings and roll it into longer dated OTM calls in Feb/March. Unless they beat guidance massively for Q1/Q2, the stock will sit tight, and then gain over the coming weeks as institutions continue buying.",2020-12-01 23:53:13

A message to the paper-handed sissies and 🌈🐻,0.93,"Dear paper-handed sissies & 🌈🐻,

If I’ve learned anything after losing 5k since February, it’s that you don’t lose until you sell. 90% of the trades that I fumbled, due to being a paper-handed retard, mooned soon thereafter. 

If you didn’t notice in the past couple of weeks prior to this slow “sell off” of GME, PLTR, and a handful of others these last few days, there was a large amount of bullish sentiment surrounding these stonks and you more than likely got AT LEAST 1-2 nice trades off before this ball draining decline (if you didn’t FOMO entirely too late). A large number of the bearish posts were being downvoted to oblivion or deleted by shit mods. Weird right. (Insert bull trap) 

Now, if you look at the recent posts regarding these same stonk handles, there’s a growing number of bearish fucktards saying things like “PLTR $10 EOY” & “GME going back to $5”. 🤡 The shorts are getting theirs during this time and are taking what they came for before the inevitable occurs with all of these (our testicles dragging across the moon, Mars, your mom’s chin, what have you 🚀🚀🚀). This is our time to shine. You heard it hear first. (Insert bear trap)

TL;DR - Don’t go against your senses and go all gay bear on us ... we’re holding strong and retail is about to overtake institutional. Don’t go too short on your calls but be sure to lock in these free tendies. 📈

GME $25+ EOY. 
PLTR $35+ EOY.

[Positions Screenshot](https://imgur.com/gallery/7TwkYUI)

GME $30c 4/16/21

GME $20c 12/4 (gamble in case I’m entirely wrong and retarded and we moon this week)

Your daddy",2020-12-01 22:35:48

"$GME, a word to the paperhands",0.93,"To all the GME FOMO investors (I use that term loosely) do you notice how everyone is buying shares of GME? When’s the last time you ever saw WSB buy shares of anything? This isn’t a PLTR pump and dump. There are a ton of great DDs on this play so I won’t go into it here, but it’s a 1-5+ months investment horizon. 

Words of advice: Stop FOMO buying deep OTM weekly calls at the peak hoping for a 10x return right away. And stop pussyhandsing your shares and crying to the sub after a down day or two. Do some research and have some conviction for once in your life.

Positions: all in on shares + 12/31/20 $20c + 4/16/21 $30c bc fuck diversification

Listen up you paper handed nio/pltr/tesla cucks,0.89,"Disclaimer i own nio, Pltr and tesla shares 



Imagine believing all the autists spamming PLTR HURDUR TO DA MOON REEEE every post last week, and i mean literally every post. Where are you cucks now? Weeklies expired worthless? Panic sold at todays dip? Good.


Same goes for nio and tesla paperhand cucks who sold today based off Nikola tanking after the Lockout period ending. YOU KNEW THIS WAS A SCAM. Options merely allowed people to make money on a clear falling knife stock, and if you yolod into pltr weeklies or owned nkla stonks you deserved to give your wendys paycheck to thetagang.


My point being is to DO YOUR OWN FUCKING RESEARCH BEFORE entering a position, not AFTER.


Nio is looking extremely bullish in 2-5 years, a forecast of $300 is not unlikely. This is not ""long term"" in stock terms at all.

Same with pltr. We know tesla will continue to experience meme levels of growth until elon dies and it tanks, or they end up turning more thsn a 1% profit. Either way don't doubt lord musk.

If you listened to me about SPCE you'd be rich right now.,0.93,"Listen, this is my last post about this, but SPCE has gone from $18 to $29+ in one month. It's very quickly approaching it's all time highs in the 40s, blowing through resistances. I made [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0x7rj/are_you_paying_attention_yet_spce_is_happening/) [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0lhsr/another_fair_warning_on_spce/) about this and everyone was too focused on PLTR to notice it.

While you've missed this first leg, we're expecting a new flight window for their final test flights VERY soon. When those flights go up, we're going to probably hit $40 a share. In Q1 2021 Richard Branson will be making his long awaited flight to space. It will be highly publicized, and likely live-streamed. 

Additionally, Virgin Galactic was awarded a $45million contract from NASA yesterday, and has previously picked up contracts from other governments as well. Reopening reservations, landing contracts, expanding to hypersonic point to point travel, orbital flights, and massive publicity from existing reservations is on the horizon.

This shit's got a lot lot more room to run. My bull thesis is $50+ by Richard Branson's flight, even more if shorts pile in and get burned.

SUMO Valuation - Significant Potential Upside Ahead,0.93,"Recently IPO'd, SaaS company SUMO trades a significant discount to its peers despite comparable growth rates and margins. See below:

SUMO : Price/sales = 13x, revenue growth YoY = 49.6%, Gross margin 71.3% (from S-1)

FROG: Price/sales = 30x, revenue growth YoY = 40%, Gross margin 81% (from 10-Q)

DDOG: Price/sales = 40x, revenue growth YoY = 68%, Gross margin 78% (from 10-Q)

PLTR: Price/sales = 40x, revenue growth YoY = 52%, Gross margin 48.3% (PLTR press release)

SNOW: Price/sales = 100x, revenue growth YoY = 121%, Gross margin 62% (S-1)



As SaaS companies continue to report earnings over the rest of this week and next (SUMO reports 12/7), I think SUMO will see several significant upgrades from analysts, especially as its business is better in a Covid-free world and company guidance should reflect increased optimism.

My first stock ever was NIO at $30 and yeah.. cuz leverage and newbie etc i was down as fuck.. got called margin my second day and almost forced to close positions. Diamond handed that day and next day i was up like $800 from -$400. This position been sold at $42 (at this stage I found this sub via [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/)), bought again at $38 and sold at $51. That was my first $3000 and since did not go back to NIO again.

I have been in a lot of meme stocks in this month.. NIO, LI Auto, xPev, PLTR, CI\^IC..

Lot of times ive been in ""negative"" after open a position but only 1 time sold it (CI\^IC.. yeah, missed like $7000 if i just held 1 week more lol)

* He went to Stanford Law School and called it a ""glorified trade school"".
* He moved to Berlin, taught himself German, and wanted to retire with $250k tendies to pursue various ""forms of debauchery"".
* He got a PhD in fucking philosophy at a German university, something that Karp even admits himself is totally unemployable and useless, just like you.
* He went on after to 'start a business' pumping meme stocks himself and developed a reputation for it.
* He practices tai chi and qigong in public with a real sword. Motherfuckers, he literally studied the blade.

[WSB] The Technicals Behind PLTR (SPOILER: MOON! 🚀 ) for NYSE:PLTR,0.86,,2020-12-01 13:15:55
What I learned from half year of investing (and trading),0.94,"Sup retards, I am writing this to share what I learned in my small time of investing and trading till now. Of course there are a lot of retards here who are less retarded than I am, and so know more about investing than I do. This is partly to keep a note to myself (and make it public), so I don't repeat the same mistakes again. And partly to give some pointers to those here who are more retarded than me.

TL;DR: Stonks don't always go up. Get your emotions in line, especially jealousy of people posting their 1000+% gain porn. pre-market is a bitch. do your DD and don't just buy highly upvoted tickers. good money can be made in safer plays as well (like buying Shopify when it dropped to 900 due to vaccine news.). PLTR & NIO TO THE MOON.

1. This is something you would already know. There are a lot of people here posting 1000+% gains in a few weeks/months. But there are a lot lot more than that who are not making that, and in fact losing. I know you know that as well. So don't fucking get jealous and play stupid gambles (like buying fucking nikola at fucking 79$). You are already a retard, you already have a disadvantage compared to those outside. Don't let your emotions get the better of you as well.
2. Pre-market is fucked up. Never buy a gamble stock just by seeing high pre-market rise. You will almost always lose. 
3. You're new to WSB, you are seeing people posting a lot of tickers that are going to be the next NIO or the next PLUG. Don't go buying all those ticker. When someone posts a DD, don't just scroll down and comment 'All I read was buy' and buy the stock. Do your own DD.
4. (This may not apply to all) Try to limit the number of stocks you're holding to a minimum. Diversification is good but make sure you're not going overboard (like having only 2000$ to invest/trade and buying 40 tickers with that). Even if all those 40 stocks are hot growth stocks, you're not gonna make a lot of money because a lot of them WILL go down. Buy the stocks in which you feel confident that they will go up in some time. Don't buy something just because it has been going up a lot and everyone is saying it'll go up.
5.  Hold what you've bought for some time if you believe in the stocks short term/ long term capability. Don't sell it as soon as you're down some 5-10%. If you do that you'll just be buying high selling low all the stocks. As a personal example: I really believe in Unity's business and capability. I bought unity at 95, but got scared when it fell down to 86, then, as soon as it hit 95 again I sold. I was stupid, Now unity is 150. Believe in yourself more than some random retards on WSB.
6. I have made more money when hyped stock fall, compared to when hyped stocks rise. Invest in what seems safer (and can give good returns as well). For ex. when pfizer vaccine news came out, Shopify and Zoom fell like crazy. Even though I feel Zoom stock valuation is sooooo fucking stupid, I bought the dip and sold both the stocks just yesterday for about 20-30% gains on both. - This is really subjective, but I like this more compared to investing in PLTR at 30 or NIO at 50 (By the way I have positions in both of them and am about 100% up on both, so PLTR, NIO to moon). Remember that losses are also big in high growth stocks just like gains.
7. Keep a fucking target of how much return youre looking for. Dont get distracted by posts every day on WSB posting their 1000+% returns. You need 25-30% return a year to get rich eventually (this is just my personal target). Have a separate account for trading where you've trying to get crazy gains (and actually getting crazy losses), and keep the amount in that account minimum.

I know all this is just a repeat of some obvious things everyone says and my post may just get removed. Who cares.

Another thing: my experience here is just from stocks and not from options. I am from India and it is illegal for us to trade options in US market. 

Finally, even though everyone in WSB is a retarded autist and they just jack off to their gains and other's losses. I've learned a lot from posts in this sub. And this is also a really good sub for discovering stocks to do DD on. Many other positives of WSB, just not mentioning them here.

Happy trading/investing.",2020-12-01 12:39:24

PLTR: Immigration & Visa applications software for UK provided by Palantir,0.93,"Snippet:

""The software system is produced by the controversial US tech firm Palantir and will pull together information from different government computers to monitor the flow of people and vehicles across the UK border.

Palantir has courted controversy in the United States, where its systems are used by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

This has led the human rights organisation Amnesty International to warn of ""a high risk that Palantir is contributing to serious human rights violations of migrants and asylum-seekers"".

The company denies the suggestion and says it remains extremely concerned about protecting human rights, privacy rights, and civil liberties in general.

The UK government has stressed that Palantir will only process data in Britain and that strict measures are in place to protect personal information.""

"F Stocks- FUBO, FUTU, FOUR, FROG",0.93,"FUTU- Consider this the Chinese Robinhood. This thing is printing money and is just getting started. See growth rates. This stock could be a 10x bagger. This is a Chinese stock so it will likely not see the multiples as they typically trade at lower multiples as compared to American peers. The cash on hand, huge financial performance and it's niche make this a great play that might turn into a Chinese MEME stock. I have purchased shares and might buy some leaps. This is my favorite of the F stocks. Selling puts, buying shares and might purchase more options. Balance sheet and growth are phenomenal.

FOUR- Shift four payments is an american payment processor that has had some hiccups due to covid. as you can see, even during Covid they have managed to narrow losses. Q3 is a turn around as compared to Q2 and they are beginning to land big contracts such as contracts with the NFL and other large companies. I am selling puts. This thing could be a great growth story as well as a great acquisition target. Recently sold off after hours due to convertible notes that were issued. might be a good opportunity to buy. this is my second Favorite.

FUBO- many of you have seen this ticker. This is a digital streaming television service that focuses on sports. This has seen significant growth and it is projected to tripe sales in the next 3 years. Currently a stock with great growth, a niche market and might be a likely acquisition target. Also, the name is meme worthy and the market cap is 1.8B. Growth is exceptional. This is really a growth play as the financials look terrible. See article. growth is \~60% and average revenue per customer is up 15%.

FROG- A  software play that allows large companies to manage large scale software rollouts and version control. I don't understand all the technical details but it had an epic ipo and has cooled off. growth is exceptional, it's expensive but could be a very promising play. growing \~50% yoy. market cap is 6.4B so it is really trading at a premium as people expect it will continue to grow due to the large TAM. This year it appears it will grow about 40% and ideally the recent ipo will increase growth rates.

Apex Technologies (soon to be reverse merged with AvePoint) could potentially be one of the most undervalued plays on the market.,0.93,"Alright retards here me out as I give a quick dd on AvePoint/ Apex Technologies and why it could be a potential rocket ship to Mars. I haven’t seen any dd posts recently so consider this a reminder and don’t get caught sleeping. 

For those that haven’t heard, the private company AvePoint and the public SPAC Apex Technologies agreed to a reverse merger last week that will become official by Q1 2021, most likely by the end of January or beginning of February. 

So, what is AvePoint? AvePoint was founded in 2001 and is a partner of Microsoft. They work in management, protection, and storage of data for Microsoft office 365. (I know you retards apparently love data companies like PLTR so this is right up your alley).

AvePoint has strong business relations with Microsoft and has won Microsoft company of the year 5 of a possible 19 times and the Microsoft VP sits on the board of directors for AvePoint. They also have some legitimate leadership with one of their co-founders being the former CFO of Oracle and the other co-founder being the former head of tech investing at Goldman Sachs. 

On top of that their financials are pretty phenomenal as they have no outstanding debt, 250 million in cash reserves, are profitable, and have been growing in revenue steadily YoY. They are projected to grow roughly 40% in revenue by 2022 too, as they are seeing huge upticks in demand as businesses around the globe are continually transitioning to cloud services and moving their businesses online. 

AvePoint will be priced at a $2 billion valuation once the merger is official and they go public.  

For comparison one of their main competitors, Snowflake, is valued at about 90 billion, while having about only twice the current revenue of AvePoint’s. 

Hypothetically, if AvePoint were to become half the value of Snowflake based on revenues, it would be worth more than 20x what it will be at the time it goes public. 

Not saying it’s going to become worth 45 billion but we could see it balloon to 20 billion+ easily, which would still be about 15x what it is now. 

Lastly, they currently do not have calls but as the merger date gets closer, options will be added so you idiots can blow up your accounts on FDs. 

TL;DR Buy apex Technologies and be prepared for the rocket ride.

Tuck it in boys, I know the sight of such a long thick green candle like that excites you, but hold on, **there's more.**

Well 'bout an hour ago [The Wall Street Bet  Journal published a piece](https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-makes-mac-commitment-opening-door-to-apple-developers-11606798804#:~:text=Under%20the%20agreement%20disclosed%20Monday,own%20versions%20of%20the%20machines) about how AMZN was going to be buying AAPL Macs or something like that. Cloud computing nerd shit. idk. I think this means Bezos is about to get in bed with Tim Apple and buy some Macs. And by some I mean buy some warehouses full of Macs.

There's an alternative piece by Seeking Betas, in case you're a peasant that can't afford Wall Street Journal's subscription (everyone should be rich af from PLTR calls 🚀🚀 ). You can google it yourself bc I can't post it.

But waittttt, AAPL will probably gap up since with that fat volume eod and that article that was posted at like 12AM EST. Well first of all, there's probably some insider trading shit right there. Fuck them for not tell us. Secondly, you're right. AAPL will probably get bigly erectly and gape up when the market opens. Fuck that means we can't profit from this right?

Bollinger Bands are NOT Astrology - Use Them to Time Your Moves,0.84,"A lot of you fuckers shit on TA, but Bollinger bands are actually great for letting you know when a stock is actually breaking out instead of just temporarily overbought or oversold, especially when combined with relatively high volume.

It represents a range of (usually) plus or minus 2 standard deviations above a moving average, which is (usually) set at 20 periods. You probably don't care about that because I know that none of you can do statistics anyway, but you should. Why? It basically indicates is that **95% of the time, significant movement outside of the bands is not going to last**. This is incredibly useful for timing entry points and exit points throughout the day.

What I've found is that **a significant jump outside of the range created by the Bollinger bands is usually followed by a reversal, allowing you to maximize your profits** on exit by selling at a peak or on entry by buying at a trough. Let's use everyone's favorite meme stock of the week as an example. Focus on the examples circled in white for now.

[PLTR, the morning of 11\/30, 1-minute candlestick graph with Bollinger bands](https://preview.redd.it/o8popcybei261.jpg?width=1557&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf8a85fc29173930ba5e0b9632a5b5f42cc77a2c)

In each of the pairs of white circles, there is significant movement outside of the bands and relatively high volume, which is followed by either a retracement or a reversal. The first and last pairs show the stock price extending more significantly beyond the Bollinger bands for longer periods of time, along with relatively higher volume than the middle two examples. Here, the first and last pairs are reversals, while the middle two pairs are retracements. **The stronger the signals, the more likely it is to be a legitimate reversal instead of a retracement**. If you want to, you can combine this with other indicators like RSI if you know what you're doing, but volume is a pretty good indicator of signal strength on its own.

On the other hand, if the stock price steadily hugs one of the bands, it usually indicates a legitimate trend. You can use this to hop on an uptrend if you're buying, or to cut your losses if you're selling. The magenta example shows a clear downtrend. Note that the stock price hugs the lower band, never falling significantly below it. It's accompanied by relatively high volume, so you know that the signal is strong.

I've only been trading for 7 months, but I've been doing much better since I've started paying attention to these indicators. I pretty much only use the 1-minute graph with this, although it can likely be applied to other relatively short periods too. I'm not saying this will let you see every reversal before it happens like some sort of psychic, but it's a hell of a lot better than flying blind. Start using them, you can thank me later.

[DD] GME earnings and option positioning,0.94,"Ok retards it's time to take a closer look at GME now that earnings are coming up on Dec 8th. First of all don't expect earnings beat from GME for this quarter, shortage of consoles and competition from Amazon and Walmart means GME's probably gonna post a disappointing report, they'll probably guide up and highlight their cleaner balance sheet and maybe even talk about restructuring like Ryan Cohen wanted but who knows what gonna happen. So yea it might dump after earnings.

but we ain't here to ""invest"" fundamentally, we're here for the epic short squeeze.  I don't give a shit about their FCF or valuation based on whatever fuckhead analyst's model. Whatever happens after earnings, it's important that we diamond hand this baby and roll your calls instead of just selling it like a weak ass pussy.

IV for options around earnings are huge at \~250%, so there's a good chance that a lot of you retards will get IV crushed (if you're worried buy your calls further out, closer to the money or just buy shares)

What I noticed is that there's a huge open interest of 20k for Dec 18 $17 puts and 12k for Dec 18 $16.5 puts. OI for call options doesn't even compare. Lots of gay bears (or maybe it's a hedge idk)  gonna get IV crushed, which is actually more bullish than you think. Because when those puts expire worthless, MM is gonna close their hedges by BUYING BACK the stock that they shorted when they hedged those puts. This effect MIGHT be very noticeable EOD on Dec 18 2020. In fact, it's probably what happened to PLTR last Friday, when about 30% of all calls expired and MM sold their hedges as your calls expired worthless, leading to a dump.

Do what you will with this information, but MINIMUM pain for MM at that week dec 18 is situated right around the $17 mark, unless the MM gamma exposure changes.

GME price too low imo

Everyone who is still stuck in PLTR or any of you that have jumped on that train a bit late this may be where you can redeem yourself and make back those tendies.

Long Term Palantir Position,0.94,"With my post nut clarity from all of your loss porn, I am gonna share with you how Theta gang gets off.

I bought 500 shares of PLTR at IPO for just under $10 (i.e. before options were available). I was quite happy to see them double to $20. I wanted to collect some profits, but didn't want to sell the shares, so I sold covered calls because IV was high. PLTR $35c 1/15/22 for $4.50 each, which was basically the longest dated highest value that was available at the time.

My timing couldn't have been worse because they were worth over $10 the next week. I bought 200 more shares at $25 and sold 2 more covered calls for $10.50.

Now my cost basis for 700 shares is about \~$14 minus the $6.20 premium, or around $7.75. I have $5500 locked up for the next year, but if PLTR is >$35 by 2022, the position would be worth \~$24.5k or \~350% return. If it drops to $20 and holds, it would be worth $14k or \~150% return. Hell, I'll make \~25% if it drops down to $10, which still beats most hedge funds. It's a 17 year old company with government contracts, it's not going bankrupt.

The point is, stop buying weeklies and think about longer term strategies. My position is down less than $100 today while a lot of you degenerates got crippled. Covered calls are your friend.

PSA - Crash Course in Taxes for New Traders. Pay less tax to make more tendies!,0.98,"***Disclaimer: see at the bottom. Getting taxes wrong may cost you money! I think my writeup is mostly correct, but I may have some errors on edge cases that could be a big deal, and you could also misinterpret what I said and make errors. Most importantly, your own tax situation is custom to you, and to really make the right decision, you have to consider all of the factors. My rules of thumb are usually correct - but sometimes may not be. Proceed at your own caution!  True tax advice requires you or a professional with full visibility into your particulars.***

You can’t be a serious trader without really understanding tax strategies. I know it’s some boring accountant BS, but it’s one of the few things, other than $420 TSLA calls and shorting NKLA at $50, that is actually free money. This should make it more motivating if your head is in the right place - making money priority #1.

Good tax decisions save you money in most cases with little or no change to your risk level. I regularly see people do stuff on this forum that is exposing them to huge tax liability. And, doing it wrong can cause you to actually zero out your account AND owe a ton of money next year.  So, here’s a crash course on how to do this. The year is almost over, and you need to do this stuff NOW to be in good shape for your tax bill next year.  (NOTE - this is for US citizens and US residents. If you are elsewhere, other rules apply. Before you cackle at us Europeans, some of you have wealth taxes which are even worse). As for Singaporeans, your tax system is awesome, la.

Anyway...

**The basics:**

Taxes are incurred in a few ways. First, whenever you SELL a capital asset(a stock, option, other securities, whatever) or close a short trade, you realize a gain or loss that is a taxable event. Secondly, when you hold 1256 contracts at year end you get marked to market (oil futures, NDX, SPX, etc). You usually wont have these. And lastly when you receive dividends, which no one on this sub ever has.

Of course, you only get taxed on gains… offset by losses that you made in the past or the SAME YEAR. The big danger with a year like this is you have massive gains that you’ve realized… which means you’ll owe massive taxes. If you trade with that money and lose it next year, you’ll not be able to mark those against your gains, and you could hypothetically zero out your account with a dumb trade next year, AND owe a ton of taxes. Also note that if you are at a net loss, you don’t owe tax, and the residual losses carry forward to protect you from taxes on the same amount of some future gain. I believe you apply STCG to STCL first, but in the absence of that, you can use LTCL. Same for LTCG vs LTCL, THEN STCL.

These taxes are generally due the following year (unless you made a ton, more on that later), and will generally be your top income tax rate plus a little (ACA surcharge of a few %), unless you have LTCG (unlikely on this forum), or have a lot of losses to offset (likely on this forum).

Lastly, each position has ‘tax lots’ which are the individual times you entered the position. If you sell less than the full position, most brokerages will try to sell whatever will cause you the least taxes, which means, it will sell to make losses first, small gains next, large gains last.

**Random Tips and Things To Know:**

*Doom Scenario* – If you take away one thing here – if you made big gains, realize losses to zero them out, and on anything leftover, SET ASIDE THE MONEY - MAYBE 40% OF THE GAIN TO BE SAFE, THOUGH FOR TRADES THAT PUT YOU IN TOP TAX BRACKETS IT CAN BE MORE, UP TO 53%. You’ll owe this tax on gains EVEN IF you zero out your account on January 2nd. Don’t put yourself in that position.  I talk about this in detail here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jqewaw/psa\_dont\_forget\_to\_lose\_all\_of\_your\_gains\_before/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jqewaw/psa_dont_forget_to_lose_all_of_your_gains_before/)

*Loss Harvesting* – A common year end strategy is to dump your losers BEFORE the end of the year so you can put them against your gains. If you have some old now worthless options sitting around that wont expire until next year, there’s big benefit to selling these off if you have gains.  TLDR – realize your losses, probably now or really soon. Beware wash sale though…

*Wash Sales* – If you sell something at a loss, and rebuy the exact same thing within 31 days, the realize is cancelled out, and the loss is added back into the cost basis of the stock. You still can get this loss, you just don’t get to call it a realized loss and offset gains with it until sold for 31 days without a rebuy. In theory, this MAY apply to call options on the same ticker… but it’s a grey area, and the IRS has not given clear guidance on this for decades despite this being a known issue. Proceed with caution here. It is agreed that if you use the EXACT SAME option, wash sale 100% applied. For different options on same ticker, it’s grey and not agreed upon by CPAs (conservative rule is – assume it’s a wash sale).

*Splitting gains over tax years* – If you have phat gains now, hedging a bit and realizing some now, some early January may be prudent so you can spread the income over lower tax brackets. Easy strategy to do.

*Holding for LTCG* – In theory, if you hold an option or stock more than a year, it becomes LTCG rate which is lower. But who does that here? Hedging these gains with put options is considered kosher with the IRS.   So, if your SHOP you got in March is up 1000% and you want to sell now, you could just buy puts into March to protect, then realize then, and pay fewer taxes via long term capital gains rate... and grab a small short term loss on those options if price didn’t go down. In general, LTCG are better to have than STCG.

*IRAs and 401ks -* IRAs are awesome. Roth is generally better especially if young. I'm not going do a bunch of writing about this, but you certainly can reduce your taxes by putting money into a deductible IRA. The problem with this is you then can't roll it over to your roth since you made a deductible contribution. Once in the IRA, obviously you can do all sorts of crazy stuff to drive returns and not pay tax.

*Income Offset* – You can writeoff $3k of losses against your primary income every year for free, no questions asked. But it does eat into your loss reserve.

*Tax Exempt Accounts -* If you are a true WSB Autist and are doing daily/weekly options inside your IRA, yes, all tax considerations there are irrelevant. Also, that's really stupid, don't do that. Unless you are already up 5000%, in which case, please stop now.

*Mutual Funds -* Not a WSB thing, but mutual funds, as opposed to etfs, do special dividends that are distributions of STCG and LTCG. These are taxable events for you. Look closely at their notices! This can be important in other accounts you hold that are not reckless day trading. Use day trading losses to offset these gains! (Assuming the mutual fund was in a taxable account, and your day trading account is also taxable). I'm not really a mutual fund expert so rely on my advice on this one even less.

*Estimated Quarterly Payments* – When you make lots and lots of money, you are expected to pay those income taxes before filing date in April. This varies by states, so check the rules if you are making A LOT (100k+ usually). For federal, you owe these up until the point where you have paid the full amount of federal tax you paid the previous year plus 10% – amounts over this you aren’t on the hook to pre-pay. There are guides online for how to play a 1040-es and so forth. TLDR - make a lot of money, check your state rules, and make sure youve paid as much federal already or will have paid by end of year as you paid last year.

*Charitable Donations* – Charitable donations do reduce tax liability. Better is to DONATE SHARES to a donor advised fund, such as what Fidelity offers, then direct the DAF to give to the charity of your choice. Money in there can also appreciate over time, so you can day trade further, albeit with indexes only. The reason this is better than donating cash is you get the writeoff of the value of the shares, AND you don’t cause a capital gains realize – so no capital gains tax. I would not donate options – you can, but they’ll get marked to market in a somewhat unfavorable manner unless massively in the money, and even then, check before you do it!

*Broker Interest -* Interest you pay your broker with a negative cash balance is deducted against your gains. Interest your broker pays to you is just income. This seldom is a big impact.

*Commissions -* Because someone will ask, broker commissions are just added to your cost of shares, so they are effectively deductible and it happens automatically.

*Trader Status* – You can elect to be a trader every year at normal filing deadline. If you do, ALL of your gains/losses inside designated accounts become income instead of STCG. This is desirable because losses can then go against your income, and you also don’t pay the ACA surcharge on investment income. You also can deduct more things against this. But, this has strict rules to do, and only applies if you are making dozens of trades a week, trading daily, and are really making a lot of money doing it. Note that this loses the ability to use 1256 taxation and ltcg in these accounts, so its sometimes just worse. The main advantage is in bad years you can put it against your Wendy’s w2.

*1256 Contracts* – These are special contracts that give you 60% LTCG and 40% LTCG regardless of the hold. XSP, SPX, NDX and RUT options do this, as do most futures contracts. They also are wash sale immune, and are grown up trader hacks. I have a long ass post about this all here, but the TLDR is that for non-long-term holds with significant amounts of money, you really should be using these instead of SPY, QQQ and IWM.  Here’s my post about that:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gq4e0l/taxes\_and\_spy\_vs\_spx\_iwm\_vs\_rut\_qqq\_vs\_ndx\_please/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gq4e0l/taxes_and_spy_vs_spx_iwm_vs_rut_qqq_vs_ndx_please/)

*GLD and SLV* – These are collectibles rate. Even worse taxes on long term than normal LTCG. FYI. Here’s a treatise on why you should use other vehicles than these:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hytk5e/stop\_overpaying\_taxes\_on\_gld\_options/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hytk5e/stop_overpaying_taxes_on_gld_options/)

*Constructive Sale* \-  If you have a long position that has made a lot, but is unrealized, and you do some crazy option trade to basically sell it (such as selling calls that are massive in the money), the IRS may decide this is a constructive sale and call it a realize. Don’t get too clever on this stuff. It usually doesn’t come up, but if the tax bill is large enough, it may.

*QOZ:* Special tax rules for ultra rich traders with good resources, like that guy who made $5m day trading PLTR. If you made hundreds of thousands of dollars in gains, and have net worth over a few million bucks (qualified investor comfortably), you could enroll in a QOZ. This allows you to defer payment of tax on designated gains for 6 or 7 years, get a 10% discount on the amount owed, AND the investment you make is tax free on gains AND can still do return of capital with a cash-out refi (usually real estate). Getting good QOZs is hard, they aren’t easily accessible, and you’ll likely want to use a family office, a rich friend, or a wealth manager if you go this route. This truly is a bonanza, but it’s hard to access. You have 6 months from when you realized a gain to use this. K-1s and 1256s count as dec 31 of that year realize.

*Hedge Funds:* These are generally awful, unless you are either a non-profit, or unless they are some really interesting specialized thing that you won't have access to and has trader status and generates mad returns always. In other words, great if you are an employee of Renaissance, bad otherwise. I'm exaggerating a little bit, but hedge funds that generate a k-1 got a lot worse with tax reforms.

*Dividends:* Least likely for this community, so last on the list. If you get a dividend from a normal stock or stock etf, it's generally a standard dividend. That's income if you've held the etf/stock less than 30 days, and LTCG tax rate (but I don’t think a ltcg) effectively otherwise. For preferred shares, this clock is 90 days. For etfs that are bonds, and bonds directly, and mutual funds with bonds, it's just interest income, so income. On rare occasions, dividends are return of capital (not taxable), municipal bond income (not taxable), LTCG distributions (taxable) and STCG distributions (also taxable).

New Spin on an Old Game: Load up on ELY (Callaway) for Top Golf Merger,0.86,"Hello autists,

Take a break from PLTR and GME and listen up for the spiciest merger of 2021. Callaway (Boomer golf company, who previously owned 14% of Top Golf, is now planning to buy the entire company through a stock issuance. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/golf.com/news/callaway-topgolf-ceos-explain-merger/amp/

Why does this matter? Bc golf absolutely thrived during the pandemic, and Top Golf is the fastest growing golf niche in America right now. Let me pull out some stats: Golfers played 20% more rounds of golf August 2020 vs 2019.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/golf.com/travel/golf-rounds-played-increase-2020-coronavirus/amp/

Additionally, Top Golf has experienced 30% yoy revenue growth each year since 2017. Top Golf is operating at similar capacity to pre-Covid thanks to the open bay environment, thus making it a reopening play that was never really punished.

This merger will weigh the company almost 50/50 between Callaway and Top Golf, with revenue streams projected to be around 50/50 too. However, this is a 1+1 = 3 scenario to me. 

Top Golf licenses its ball tracing technology to other driving ranges, a revenue stream that’s up 200%+ yoy. Also, Callaway can now market its gear through Top Golf, while exposing new players to its equipment. This is a merger that just flat out makes sense.

For all those of you who missed the pltr and gme train or are too scared to get in (if you are than gtfo of this subreddit), I'm going to show you a company that is so undervalued it hurts and its to take off soon🚀

**So what is Alteryx?**

glad you asked, Alteryx is a data analytics data science company that provides a platform for companies to perform analysis of the data, share it, and deploy lots of analytic models. The platform can be used by business analysts, programmers, and trained data scientists. The company wants to solve the problem of wasting time in the organization for doing simple Data analytics. As for 2020 60 BILLION DOLLARS per year wasted on analysts doing repetitive manual work in spreadsheets. The uniqueness of this company is that the interface of the platform is very intuitive and user friendly, using drag and drop interface and mainly reduces the need to write complex software code. Their platform is designed to interact with almost any data source, starting from IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP to AWS, Google Analytics, Workday, and more.

**Who are the customers?**

So the company has, as of 2020, approx. 7000 customers in more than 90 countries and big names like Netflix, Salesforce, Toyota, Chevron, Uber, Twitter, Xerox, Nasdaq, and many more. The company already has a name in the big boys' playground and we can expect it to continue to expand.

**Tell me more, please.**

No problem amigo. The company continues its growth strategy by a series of acquisitions mainly for developing tools and talented people. in 2019 they acquired ClearStory Data mainly because the developers are very good and can leverage them to help to develop and improve their tools. They acquired Feature Labs to augment their machine learning capabilities and to penetrate to the East coast of the US. Also the company announced strategic alliances with Adobe, UiPath and ABBYY to accelerate adoption of APA (analytic process automation) which altreyx is a leader at.

Alteryx is a subscription-based software which makes it a SaaS company the same as TTD, Shopify and so on, but it focuses on analytics. Their main competitors are the big software companies (IBM, Microsoft, SAP) and some small ones which most of them are private.                  So in order to compare them to check if they are under/overvalued, I will use companies in the same field as Datadog, Splunk, and more.

**Let's dig in for some numbers**

Annual revenue has increased from 86M to 418M in just 4 years (2016-2019) that is a 48% CAGR which is amazing. This year the company expects to grow revenues at around 15% mainly because of covid, which made companies cut expenses.

Q3 revenues growth is 38% YOY, customer growth is 24% YOY.                                                        Gross Margin is 93% (Amazing) Operating Margin is 24%. This company is super efficient and with great margins.

The company is profitable as of the 3Q with a positive EPS of 0.07. It uses more than 50% of its gross profit for R&D which is exactly what we want to see in a growing tech company.

**Balance Sheet**

Cash is down to 95M from 409M mainly because of acquisitions, but short term investments are almost double YOY with 627M. **Current Ration** is 1:4 approx. and **asset to liabilities ratio** is 1.5:1 so the company is indeed solvent and can survive even stuff like covid. Liabilities wise the company has 650M in convertible bonds which as we see can be covered by the short-term investments, It is something we should consider when the company starts to underperform, not now though.

Cash from Operating Activities for the 3Q is 16.3 M an improvement of 20%.                                      FCF is negative for the quarter mainly because of the investments they made (240M).

So the company is performing really well so far this year and is able to grow despite covid and companies reducing expenses. Of course, they need to increase their FCF but as long as they are growing and acquiring companies it's all good.

**Let's use some gay TA to see what's going on**

[AYX 1 day chart](https://preview.redd.it/eu91ywiifd261.jpg?width=1374&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=96335b788ca104400101c7f29fdc13435ce4aac7)

Well as you see AYX is in a range for quite a while (since May) with 104 and 80 acting as support and 150 and 178 as resistance. It hits 104 twice and couldn't break it and in the last 2 weeks, it tried again, and again was denied.

So the stock can now go to 150 easily or contest again the 104 level. with the tech trend going up I can see it going to retest that 150 level hoping to break it.

**Now we compare this company with other companies**

* SNOW: ‘21 EV / Rev = \~100x
* DDOG: ‘21 EV / Rev = \~ 40x
* MongoDB: ‘21 EV / Rev = \~ 25x
* **Alteryx: ‘21 EV / Rev = \~ 15x**
* JFROG: ‘21 EV / Rev = \~ 30x
* PLTR ‘21 EV / Rev = \~ 50x

(thanks  [u/xwpv8j62](https://new.reddit.com/user/xwpv8j62/) for the info)

As you see AYX is the most UNDERVALUED company here which means a lot of room to grow.

Gross Margin:

**AYX- 92%**

DDOG- 78%

SNOW - 55%

MongoDB- 69%

P/S Ratio:

**AYX-  16.95**

DDOG- 51.71

SNOW - 150.15

MONGODB-  30.88

PLTR - 47.76

AYX has the best margin, best ratios, and still is way undervalued than its peers. This is wrong and YOU have a chance to take advantage of it.

**TL:DR,**  Shares and January Calls at 120/130 strike will do the work.

Have fun guys happy trading and tendies for y'all.

"Why DOCU will be the best YOLO candidate this week, BETTER THAN PLTR (lots of research)",0.89,"When news of the Pfizer vaccine broke out, and subsequently broke markets (temporarily), I thought that the news-reported ""rotation"" out of stay-at-home and tech stocks into value stocks provided an immense opportunity to trade some of the popular tickers. In fact, I suspected that the FOMO people felt from missing out on the run following the election was replaced with a skeptical, contrarian viewpoint that life may return to pre-COVID times and stocks return to pre-COVID valuation levels.

I believe the skepticism around the rise of tech is an honest mistake. The effects of COVID on financial markets are not the result of temporary government measures, but likely of permanent regime changes. Let me roll with this as an assumption; you are already probably familiar with the concepts of MP3, rising anti-capitalist populism, a rotation out of cities, large stimulus measures, and a strengthening challenge from China against the dollar as a reserve currency. For those who recognize that 2020 is a regime change and not a temporary boost (or decline, depending on industry), there are plenty of plays worth discussing. I am intentionally going to ignore the discussion around hype stocks, like those in the EV and cannabis craze. Instead, I'm going to focus on a lesser talked about stock, that is still ""big tech"" related, in a high growth phase, and not as speculative as far as valuation is concerned. A stock like that, which does not get a lot of attention, has its moments. This week could be one of those moments, where being in it before a new wave of investors rush in might pay off nicely. Let me share the analysis I have done so far on Docusign ($DOCU).

**Notable Company Features**

DOCU's self-declared TAM is $25 billion just for the eSignature space, in which they are obviously the top player, and they also have efforts underway for a whole Suite solution, expansion (importantly, into international markets), and vertical integration. They're projected to bring in under $2 billion of that this year, so they are very much still in high growth phases, spending a lot of sales/marketing and R&D. It's not hard to see DOCU making tens of billions of dollars of revenue down the road, and this week could cement people's belief that a higher valuation is due to come sooner.

Employees also really like working at the California-based company. It ranks as one of the best companies on Glassdoor, with over 95% of people recommending the company and giving CEO approval. This piece of metadata is often very useful; great companies attract great talent.

**Fundamental Analysis**

Based on my analysis and my limited experience with financial statements, I think that the most important metric to look out for when DOCU reports earnings is going to be revenue, and how that feeds into year-over-year gross profit growth. I looked at different revenue and expense scenarios, and there wasn't much sensitivity around the consensus net loss per share estimate, of minus 32 cents. However, the year-over-year Q3 growth is estimated to be between 40 - 50% (reverse-engineering their guidance and consensus estimates gets me 42%), and my calculations show it's likely to beat the 50% mark, which I assume to be psychologically significant because growth has stayed at around 40% for over the past year.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y6i9hnfdib261.png?width=1092&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffcd6b3566d4bf27567864e40d48c41c328bb2b5

In the past two years, DOCU has experienced revenue growth of around 10% quarter-over-quarter. It's maintained an incredibly stable gross profit margin (everything is presented on a GAAP basis) of about 75%. The company's guidance for this quarter shows only a 5.5% growth in revenue against prior quarter, which looks to me like it's extremely conservative, just like the consensus estimate for Zoom in their earnings this week. Notably, both companies have beaten every quarter's revenue estimates in the past two years.

My ""base case"" for revenue growth is 13%; that's a little less than the 15% from last quarter, and keeping gross profit % flat as well, nets a gross profit growth of 52% year-over-year. I think it's probably likely that we will see gross profit growth of around 50%. Cost of revenue grew 22% last quarter; that was unusual, and I suspect it's related to the free trials. If true, then we should expect cost of revenue to go back to trend, growing in line with actual revenue and keeping gross profit margins neutral.

My ""bad case"" and ""good case"" call for gross profit growths of 38% and 61%, respectively. They use lower/higher growth rates for revenue, keeping gross profit margins flat as well. I also tweaked some operating expense assumptions in the second half of the table (see Appendix), in which I calculated a net loss per share. The consensus estimate on net loss per share looks a bit more optimistic. It is 32 cents, and my base, bad, and good case call for 34, 47, and 30 cents respectively.

Overall, I expect DOCU to comfortably beat revenue earnings by several percentage points, but the downstream impact into the final net loss per share value is unlikely to surprise.

**Technical Analysis**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9pgw9tcjib261.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=44f7ac48dcc1e8e7f0891d9c9d649e261e26c5cf

With only about 1% of shares trading hands on an average day, DOCU looks like a stock primed to win. It's been in a very tight trading range for almost the past 5 months, which followed a big rally. Looking at the volume by price indicator, it has done a lot of mean-reverting to the $215 level. More recently, it has tried to escape, getting bought up at $195 and sold at $235 more than once. That's $20 in either direction. Notably, the straddle on next week when it reports earnings shows a $22 move. DOCU's earnings is after-hours on Thursday, which follows just three days after Zoom reports its earnings. This means that we will have a good sense ahead of time of whether DOCU, which is a direct beneficiary of the COVID-era like Zoom, can maintain their explosive growth.

Looking at the broader market, the dollar is sitting at a multi-year low, and it is currently on a downward trend, which just needs a reasonable catalyst to start a lower leg down. That would presumably raise equity valuation levels. In addition, the Nasdaq is ""only"" around 25% higher than its high from February; some names gained far more than others. If you believe in the regime change from physical to virtual, all the new monetary/fiscal mechanisms to support financial markets, the democratization of investing through commission-free trades drawing in new investors (a majority of which buy and hold, raising demand), existing mania around the markets, a changing administration that will be less likely to provoke markets with tweets, and the general desensitization of the average investor, then you probably have an optimistic view like me.

**Conclusion**

Docusign reports earnings this week. Zoom reports a few days earlier, giving us an early read. Because DOCU has relatively stable finances, I think Zoom will provide key insights into what to expect. Technical indicators are strong. Revenue is likely to beat, and gross profit margin growth could impress. DOCU is an underdog in terms of hype stocks, but has all the characteristics needed to get a lot of attention. And the product that they sell is extremely well received, and they clearly have attracted a lot of talent. All said, a new leg up in DOCU's valuation looks like a real possibility.",2020-11-30 06:03:08

\-Congress is voting on legalization in December

\-Biden presidency

\-Every state with a marijuana initiative passed on November 3rd

# However, relative to $APHA.. $APHA is a much stronger play:

\-$APHA Revenue is up 124.55% YoY

\-$APHA Gross Profit 148.59% YoY

\-$APHA trailing 12-month revenue is 2.10 times what ACB generates

\-In terms of trailing 12-month prices/sales, $ACB is currently trading at 3.61x, which is slightly more expensive than $APHA, which is currently trading at 3.54x.

\-$APHA just bought Sweetwater brewing in the states (10th largest brewer in the U.S.) for 300m

With its strong financials, cheaper book value, better path towards profitability, and recent acquisition of Sweetwater Brewing (allowing it to break into the beverage industry, break into U.S., as well as leverage Sweetwater's distribution channels) **$APHA is a much better buy than $ACB.**

# Despite it's recent bull-rally $APHA is still a good buy, Morningstar has it's fair value at $11. If $APHA is the first player to profitability, it will be a dominate player in Canada and the U.S.

Positions: $APHA stonks, $PLTR stonks

"How to make money not just on PLTR... REALLY, I promise you can....",0.71,"It's simple.... this sub has become a wasteland for cast aside meme stocks.   Once they get pumped and the $$$ stops, the volume of pump posts dramatically slows down.

Just look at last weeks pumps.... NIO, BLNK, SOLO, XPEV....  


But where are the posts now?  Nowhere to be found.... but people still own them.   Baggie bagholders.

So, take that knowledge that there are weak hands holding unloved stocks, hoping that someone takes them out higher.  Take the other side.  Use gamma in your favor on the downside.   Market makers are hedged with stock because of your CALL buying.   That gamma will reverse with PUT buying.    They'll need to sell stock and your PUTs will moon.

Just remember that when you degenerates move on from PLTR, you can make money as the light dims and the pump fades.

Is the WallStreetBets sub-reddit fools gold or are we a diamond in the rough? I think the latter,0.97,"They always make fun of us ~~traders~~ gamblers here at r/WallStreetBets, but who \*really\* has the last laugh? Is it us Chads while we eat our crayons on the way to the Lambo shop? Or are the virgin traders truly better than us?

I'm going to show you something. Something that's never been seen by human eyes, never computed by any type of algorithm, something our wive's boyfriends wouldn't even pay attention to. This is the WallStreetBets sentiment and hype detection.

I've come to the conclusion that WallStreetBets is #1 when it comes to finding trends and finding stocks. It doesn't matter if this is after-the-fact that the stock price shot up 50% in 2 days. It doesn't matter that the stock is something nobody paid attention to until finally the whole world start trading it (PLTR). What it comes down to is the fact that WSB will find literally any stock after it has already mooned. Stock up 10% for the day? WSB knows about it. Stock up 20% in the last week? WSB has already traded it. It's genius.

**Here's the kicker**. \*Most\* times after a stock has mooned once and WSB hops on the trend, the stock will go through another 1 or 2 periods of ""mooning"". If you are new to the industry of printing tendies, grab a tequila on the rocks and have a drink with me while I go through some sentiment on the WallStreetBets forum.

&#x200B;

I'm not even going to start with PLTR (Palantir) because that would be too obvious. Let's start with XPEV.

&#x200B;

**XPEV**

Look at this sentiment chart. The stock wasn't even mentioned a single time until some autist found an alternative EV company to gamble on after it shot up 10% in a single day.

https://preview.redd.it/un64jt1z47261.png?width=1608&format=png&auto=webp&s=311103e4373fa04790226cebe751d1d35ca9aa9b

1st wave sentiment peaked at 3% of the sub-reddit's comment volume. What happened next? The stock stayed flat for 7 days and you autists completely forgot about it. Next stop - Wave 2: Comment volume peaking at roughly 5% of all comments after the stock price went from $33 to $43 in one day. Massive spike in chatter around the ticker and the stock price continues it's meteoric climb for a whole month. You can see another 1 or 2 waves where sentiment rises after big moves in stock prices.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**CRSR**

https://preview.redd.it/0scjg83257261.png?width=1612&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbaca71ea742ea0c1431dde33304aa009c277ba8

Next up is Corsair Gaming. None of you autists even knew the stock existed 2 months ago. We can see wave 1 happened early November with small gains in the stock price. Sentiment was steady as autists everywhere were drooling over consistent gains for the first time, loving every minute of it, kind of like when you kiss your cousin for the first time. Wasn't long after we see wave 2 and 3 of the trend where the stock continues it's mission to Mars.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**LI** 

https://preview.redd.it/alxnfwz257261.png?width=1612&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c9ebd19dec396d22ad8146e8fb1732277cd10e0

Next we'll look at LI. 99% of you, including myself, don't even know what this company does. All we know is that STOCKS ONLY GO UP. The first wave happened 3 weeks ago when comment volume reached 5% of all the comments on the sub-reddit. Stock price shot up 30% in a single day. Sounds insane that the momentum would continue upward, but it has. Not only that, the stock price has gone up another 30% in the last 3 weeks.

&#x200B;

**PLTR**

https://preview.redd.it/vs5zaon357261.png?width=1630&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f6c883545d1bf1b550890d7c4ad4518dafdde02

The PLTR sentiment chart is nothing short of magnificent for a sentiment junkie like myself. Comment volume has been rising at the same rate as the stock price. On Friday roughly 50% of discussion comments mentioned the ticker PLTR. Something that you either loved or found incredibly annoying. The only other tickers to ever break the 50% comment volume barrier are Tesla and NIO.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

What's the next meme stock going to be? Is it GME? Do we regress back to PRPL gang? Nobody really knows, but one thing I can agree with is that wave 1 of the trend is almost always the early adopters with gorilla balls willing to risk large amounts of capital on a stock nobody's ever traded before. Once a few believers hop on the train the whole sub-reddit jumps on the bandwagon headed to hell or Valhalla.",2020-11-29 15:21:30

ZoomInfo to the moon or is it doomed?,0.7,"So lockup period for ZoomInfo ends on Monday. I saw some retard say that we should short the shit out of this because all the paper hands investor pussies at the big banks are gonna sell and take profits. 

I went back and tracked the movements of the last 10 stocks that had their lock up period end. None of them showed any significant decline on the day of the lockup ending, maybe 1-4% movements, and the bigger ones are considering that you got in at the very top and sold at the very bottom. None of them also showed any significant tendency to decline, and either continued an existing uptrend or traded sideways. 

Hence, why the fuck would I short this thing? If any of you retards knows something that I don't, do enlighten me with your autism.

Positions: NIO stock, bought at $50, FTEK, DPW, PLTR

Edit: Okay you spastic dumbasses, I didn't realise that you idiots need so much evidence. Some guy comes on here screaming 'BUY PLTR' and you fucks rush in and buy, and I'm out here trying to make a discussion and getting shit on. 

Here is the site that I used to get the stocks that were about to have their lockup period end:

https://www.marketbeat.com/ipos/lockup-expirations/

Start with Inari, work backwards 10 times. All these stocks did not move a significant amount upon lockup expiration. Don't take my 'lying' word for it, check it yourself. 

It even tells you on the site that you can expect a '1-3%' decline in the share price. 

Now, if you are happy with 1-3% moves, by all means please go for it. But for most of you on the sub reddit, this is not an option since you all look for meme stocks that move 10-20%, if not more, in a day. I'm one of you retards, hence I was looking for a bigger move.",2020-11-29 10:24:30

"Mckesson 3 weeks out? Pfizer/bntx/Moderna all priced in. Distributors will make bank, and Mckesson is the largest.",0.82,"Mckesson, pumped by our dear friend Cramer about a week and half ago, only to crash the following day on news that amazon is entering the pharmacy space. Mckesson has market cap close to 30B, and a forward P/E of 10. If we wanna make some tendies, we gotta move on from the Pfizer/bntx/Moderna and other vaccine plays. Who wins the vaccine race? Who cares, Mckesson is the winner as it is the largest of the 3 distributors who have a monopoly on the markets and selected as the main partner in operation warp speed. Mckesson has annual revenue of roughly 200B, and margins are razor thin. Margins are so thin, there is no more meat on the bone for Amazon to chew off. Regardless this is a short term play so no need to delve into competition, opiate settlements, and risks. The play here is vaccine rollout week which should be ~3 weeks out. With a vaccine imminent, and the general consensus that an effective vaccine is found, the challenge now is logistics. As more media is focused on logistical issues of distribution, more attention will be focused on Mckesson. Mckesson has only received negative press for the last couple years with the opiate crisis, some positive news should right the ship, and I think we could push to 195-200 share. We have bounced nicely from the Amazon competition sell off, and should look to push higher over the next few weeks. I own stock, but will be looking to buy 195 call monthlies on Monday.

"If PLTR hits $40 in the next 2 weeks, I'm leaving the girlfriend I live with.",0.94,"There's really nothing more to say. I haven't been happy in my 1 year-relationship. My girlfriend probably moved in with me with the expectation that I'll **pay her $40k Nursing School debt THAT SHE NEVER EVEN GRADUATED FROM (and she never told me about this debt**)**.** She was working as a receptionist but quit when we moved in because of 'mental health issues'.

Honestly I've taken her to a psychologist, cared for her, even took some leave just to spend time with her and help her recover. I give her alone time when she asks for it. And when I'm at home, I always do the chores and ask her if she's game to go eat something nice and spend more time together.

One day, I pull up to our condo and my door is open. I see some other *fucking guy* leaving my house, and he looks like he's been on a million different drugs.

Pissed, I ask her about it and she gets angry at me, asking me why I'm never home and why I always abuse her. She dodges the question over and over and says that it's just 'a friend' she opened the door to because no one was home to keep her company. This happens about 2 more times and one day, I confront the guy in the front door and turns out he's '**rented**'.

First off. Where did she get the money? Has she been renting guys out with the little ""salary"" I'm giving her to spend while I'm working my ass off  providing for both of us? I'm a freaking security guard earning $19 CAD/hr. Which is not bad but not sustainable for a relationship where one person pays for two.

I was pissed to hell.

There was something she didn't know about, though. I've been stashing away a little bit of money, starting with 5K CAD after finding about this reddit site. At that time, I was honestly depressed because I had a hard time paying for our condo and with debt. And perhaps that fueled me with all-inning that 5K with a PLTR options play (call) that expired Nov 27, 2020. Oct 30, 2020 when I bought multiple calls for PLTR it rockets all the way to **wakanda** and to **jupiter**. I'm now 1012% up. I cash out before Citron shorts it. **(DW I'll add that money to buying PLTR STOCKS**, less riskier than doing options).

***How does this relate to my girlfriend?***

It relates. It relates because I'm going to leave her fucking ass. Actually, even if PLTR doesn't hit $40 I'm STILL going to leave her ass. I have to pay spousal support, because of our cohabitation agreement, but when I looked at the calculator online, it amounts to about $82 per month for **0.5** to **1 year**. I'll do it and then cut all ties. And that bitch'll have to handle her debt herself. I'll cut all ties and leave without a fuckin word.

It's not like we are obligated to one another. I haven't committed to her through marriage. And this is my decision.

So her, that 'rental' guy, Jim Cramer, and CITRON can go suck my hard, throbbing cock because PLTR is making 50k liters of blood gush into it every time it goes up. Goodbye and I'll see you Monday when that shit pumps to the moon and beyond.",2020-11-29 00:22:37

This is a bubble,0.75,"Just like during the dot com bubble investors were getting so FOMO they began investing in any company that had .com at the end of it and when those companies didn't produce the results they expected the bubble had burst sending shockwaves throughout the rest of the market.

The same problem is happening now, people invest in actually profitable companies like Google, Facebook and Tesla but more and more people are getting anxious about missing out (PLTR cough cough) that they invest into any FinTech, EV, and Digital company just because the CEO said they will grow. Keep in mind that NIO is more overvalued than TSLA and yet TSLA still has bigger potential than NIO, just like Apple is adopting USB Type-C, so can Tesla adopt replaceable batteries if they're proven successful by NIO except the market will already be made ready for it by NIO.

What do they do?

To introduce them and what they do i'll link you this video

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFaWb0aUjPk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFaWb0aUjPk)

If you're too lazy to watch it, they are the first to make 3D printers which can produce electronics. Not a difficult concept to wrap your head around. They're on track to revolutionize the manufacturing process for electronics.

\_\_\_

Demand:

Their product is another company's capital. They make it easier and faster for other companies to make money so there will always be demand for their products. From big corporations at that. They have already worked with the US army, and leading PCB Technology companies.

They customer base extends from big corporations in need of capital. NNDM technologies also benefit educational institutions. Yeah it's nice for the youth of the world to learn more about technology but lets be honest. Colleges are the biggest scams in America, they have money to spend from squeezing 50k+ from every single one of their students. When this company starts running, colleges are gonna want in on the action.

They have already sold one of their printers to a University in Hong Kong

Added note: They have customers all around the world.

Investors:

I'm not just one retard trying to sell this company to other retards. Big name investors see their potential too.

Cathy Woods (Who invested in Tesla before they were big) Chief investor of ARK Invest has been consistently buying large sums of shares during the following weeks. It holds the 23rd position in their ARKQ ETF among other big names like Tesla and Apple.

\_\_\_

Finances:

This is the ugly side of things. This company is not YET profitable, and probably wont be for a while. 3D printers are expensive. HOWEVER, as stated, big name investors are putting money into them to keep them alive and growing.

While they're not profitable, they have cash and utilize financial instruments to their advantage.

They have used direct offerings to steadily give investors opportunities to support their business and eat up more shares of their company. The last direct offering dropped the stock's price down significantly which is understandable because they offered the shares at $4. However, it did not take long for the stock's price to sky rocket shortly after big name investors bought up those shares. This is predicted to happen again. It has plenty of room to run until then. and if you're following the ticker, you'll be able to capitalize on the next direct offering and grab shares at a huge discount.

The price usually goes up after a direct offering.

Nano Dimensions isn't profitable but have plenty of investors who believe in them to support them until they are.

WARNING: THE PRICE WILL DIP ONCE THE DIRECT OFFERING HAPPENS. This is HEALTHY for the stock and will help it grow. It's not expected to happen for a month but NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHEN. Be wary of how much money you put in before the direct offering.

Personally though, when I see that discount, It's open fucking season.

WSB’s unhelpful sentiment towards PLTR.,0.86,"No I am not an employee of WSB’s HR team, shit i’m even guilty of doing the same myself but I wanted to raise something which doesn’t help speed up our journey to the moon:

Firstly; Can we stop referring to PLTR as a meme stock? Palantir is a well established & respected (in terms of everything but ethics) company. it just so happens it was IPO’d at a ridiculous price and combined with its complex offerings which no one understands, it’s picked up a lot of attention from all different kind of investors. A classic example of a meme stock would be NKLA and it hope the differences are obvious. 

Secondly: I’ve seen a lot of posts suggesting WSB’s PLTR push is “market manipulation “. Do your retards understand that would require the facts and figures to be altered in some way shape or form? Hate to break it to you but your average post “PLTR to Moon🚀🚀🚀” by little Jeff sitting on a toilet in his mother’s basement while trying to figure how why he’s constipated as he’s only had ramen for the 73rd straight day today isn’t exactly what the SEC or any other finical regulatory body will define as Market Manipulation. 

TLDR; Put some respeck on PLTR’s name and we are too retarded for market manipulation.",2020-11-28 19:19:25

What about CRSR?,0.65,Everybody here talking about PLTR and GME but what the fuck will happen to CRSR monday?,2020-11-28 19:11:51
How to ride momentum/meme stocks like PLTR/NIO/CRSR (and soon GME) without getting burned.,0.89,"Quick disclaimer, this isn't the only way, and it doesn't work if you buy at the top (obviously).  But I believe this is one of the better methods for maximizing returns while ensuring you don't get screwed when the train stops and the stock dumps 25% in a day.

Essentially what you do, is you buy a few slightly OTM calls dated at least 3-4 weeks out on a stock in meme status.  Sit on them until they go ITM and the value goes up substantially and then sell it, converting it into two new OTM calls for a similar distance out. The other important aspect is that there is leftover money after purchasing the two replacement calls.

&#x200B;

Example, in CRSR I bought a feb call for 4, sold it for 17 and bought two new feb calls for 5 each.  This way, I was able to increase my call position, while recovering my initial investment and locking in 300 dollars in profit. I did this 3 times while it moved from 23 to 53.  Now, I have a much larger position in CRSR than I started with in terms of money/calls, but even if those become worthless, I still made a lot of money on the stock (this was all with slightly otm stocks, but further otm would work as well).  It removes the need to time the top and bottom etc.  As long as you get in early enough to do one flip, you make a profit

&#x200B;

Again, this won't work as well for normal stock movements, but for these massive meme stocks it is a killer strategy.  It is especially important for GME, where it is poised to have the largest short squeeze in history with 125% of float shorted during a time where fomo is probably as high as any time in history.  We could squeeze to 40, or 400....no one really has any clue.  Once the squeeze ends, I would assume the stock price will dump back into the 30s.  Having a way to avoid having to sell at that point is important, and averaging out as it goes up runs the risk of missing out on massive profits. If someone else has a better strat, I'd love to hear it!

&#x200B;

Please ask questions here, I'm happy to help, but I can't handle the number of DMs I've been getting lately, and I PROMISE someone else has the same question you do and would benefit from it being in the thread.

For those asking - current positions (not showing my 1500 shares) and a brief explanation of my short term plan IF GME doesn't start squeezing before ER. This changes to the above strategy as soon as the squeeze kicks off.  [https://imgur.com/6Onvz7I](https://imgur.com/6Onvz7I)",2020-11-28 19:03:57

WSB Autist Game Plan Week of November 30 (All-in-One Thread),0.92,"Yoo! I've been browsing these autistic forums and all I see is multi-threads asking the same questions, asking about the same stocks, asking about the next big Yolo.

Here is everything summed up:

\*\*\* Edit \*\*\*

 This week there is a vote on legalizing MaryJ and there are plenty of stocks to choose from:

ACB - we all know the bread and butter of this one.

CGC - expensive out of all of them.

KERN - 

But the one I have my eyes on because its fairly cheap and has an announcement on December second i trading under $1. I think there is a merger that is going to be announced soon. I plan on loading up on BOTH shares and CALLS 1/2$ strike for 2021. I feel that out of all Cannabis stocks this one has the best risk vs reward. Couldnt list the name here bc it is considered a banned ticket, probably because its a penny stock. Do your own DD.

\*\*\*\*\*

PLTR - clearly is this is the TSLA of AI/Data. We will most likely see a small pullback in the coming days as more autists lock in their gains, but this is an opportunity to buy shares at a discount and some cheaper calls far out into 2021 (35C + or higher). You can go ahead and buy some next week.

GME - If you look at GME's performance over last 20 years it has its best/high stock value at console release time. This year wont be any different and the tradition will continue. There is a lot of news about the activist investor / ex Chegg dude trying to restructure the company, huge short interest, cash on hand and early debt redemption. Expect GME to Sky rocket past 20$ before Christmas. TLDR: I bought 75 Jan 20C, will add more next week further out into March+.

SWIR - Sierra Wireless. Definitely a sleeper stock, but recent financial earnings/report have been good. Stock is current trading at a discount and options March and later are pretty cheap. I have 100x March 20C. I expect this one to creep slowly til then and surprise us again in February with Q4 earnings.

TSLA - Papa Musk is Jesus is human form. We should give thanks and praise for all the tendies he has rained unto this world. Until then, stay cautious, tesla is up 50% in like 2 weeks, it will most likely continue its climb up, but right now isnt the time to buy options, wait for a pullback b/c they are too expensive.

MP - plenty of posts about rare earth elements. This is a long term play, I dont expect it to rally as hard as PLTR but its a good side stock to own, potential have some contracts, but they are pricey. I would wait for a retracement first.

CRSR - the make quality gaming accessories. If you missed the run from 15$ to 50$, fear no more, this pullback is a blessing in disguise. I am targetting a pullback to 30$ before loading up on shares and far dated calls. This should be trading and eventually catchup to LOGI.

Feel free to add other ideas. These are my current plays. This is coming from the guy who didnt Yolo but grew his account from 50k to 384k this year.",2020-11-28 17:35:54

My thoughts (as a heavy investor) on Doordash,0.74,"I used to be in the restaurant industry for over 10 years. 
I saw the beginning of 3rd party delivery systems when Grubhub began to force themselves into the industry. This pissed a lot of people off at first because the menus that they posted on their website was not always accurate. They were also representing restaurants through their service and this was a dick move. 
At first, I was annoyed by Grubhub because it was inconvenient. Orders would come in through fax machines. Sometimes orders would not come in and customers would get pissed. But eventually they started calling us to let us know a fax was sent which solved that problem. 
Eventually I began to see the potential in 3rd party delivery systems. Grubhub began to give us a lot of business.
A few years later we started seeing Postmates and then Doordash. That’s when the tablets came in to the restaurants or when people would start showing up ordering for customers through their smartphones. 
This is when I really started to see the big growth potential. 
At this point, I was managing restaurants so for me it was important to get sales in because my bonuses depended on that. So we started signing up with any 3rd party system we could think off. We had multiple tablets going. 
In 2019 is when shit hit the fan. We were seeing all the millennials and gen Z ordering like never before. I even started to hear people say “let’s Doordash some food” in public. We were getting so much business through these 3rd party companies that we had to turn off our tablets to stop orders from coming in.
The busiest companies were Doordash and Uber Eats. Postmates never became big in the 10 years I was in the industry. Grubhub began to decline over the years and eventually it became so small that I didn’t even get many order from them. 
Now we have Doordash and Uber eats. Out of those 2 companies Doordash has the better customer support and more advantages. We would get bigger orders from Doordash because they’re office friendly. It’s so easy to add people to your order if you’re in an office setting or a large gathering. 
We also saw way more orders coming in from Doordash than Uber eats. I just looked up the market share and Doordash controls 50% or the delivery business which confirms my personal anecdotes.
Obviously, both companies struggle to show profits but that’s because they’re in growth mode. And Doordash numbers are significantly better than Uber. 
My money is on Doordash. I can see this company taking over this industry or at least being a significant competitor for Uber. 
Delivery has changed forever. It will be the common way to order in the future. This isn’t just a pandemic thing. This is what the industry has become over a period of 10 years. It is also a duopoly so there’s no way a restaurant would dare compete with them through their own delivery business. As the saying goes “if you can’t beat them, join them”.

The Phases of WSB Meme Stocks,0.88,"Buy PLTR shares, hold for at least a month- this is “phase 3” of WSB.  Rational people think it can’t double AGAIN, idiots don’t know when to stop making memes & pushing it with unconditional faith of it hitting 1,000% gains, and retards make the profits. 


See NIO- NIO’s “phase 3” happened around the $26-$35 range.  Solid increase from there.  
See GME- their phase 3 happened around the $11 mark- now up to $16.  


Phase 1: WSB mentions a stock in DD and someone makes a meme about it, but 95% don’t have a clue about the company, but enjoy the hype. 


Phase 2: The stock makes more than 50% gains, and it officially becomes a “meme” stock.  95% of people still don’t know much about it, but Google the ticker.  And watch a few memes. This is where normal people think that there will be a pullback from a 50-100% gain & don’t jump on board.  Retards jump all in and see another 50% gain.  


Phase 3:  contention.  At this point, the stock has at least doubled, probably tripled since its first meme.  There is some profit taking, maybe a pullback (10-25%) but the memes don’t stop.  It get good coverage, it gets bad coverage, but all attention is good.  Can last for 1 day to 2 weeks. Then resumes at least a 30% gain from its last high.  Real wall street is forced to enter real positions in it.  


Phase 4:  Latency. Big money bought in high, refuses to sell and be the bag holder, just waits for the next round of hype to take gains, or ride higher.  (NIO is here, GME is here with the short squeeze).  


These meme stocks are a new animal.",2020-11-28 16:27:07

I understand that it would be OK to belive that PLTR is pump and dump stock if the company would be some shit ass garage brothers company, but it's not.

I just wanted to tell you that you should fucking wake up and realise how big this shit is and will be even bigger! If you are ready to let time do it's work just fucking buy these shares. NIO was $3 earlier this year, doesn't that sound like a FUCKING CHEAP price right now? Back then it didn't look that cheap. I hope you got the idea and make right decisions for yourself. 🚀",2020-11-28 16:17:45
Between 50% and 60% of PLTR trades have been shorts the last 3 trading sessions,0.93,"Since Nov 16th **199,475,851** shares of PLTR have been shorted, **over half of them in just the last 3 trading days** (sauce: [https://nakedshortreport.com/company/PLTR](https://nakedshortreport.com/company/PLTR))

If PLTR keeps mooning or even just trades sideways until Thursday (naked shorts need to be covered by actual shares within 3 days) then the squeeze is going to be on and **PLTR will leave the solar system** as naked shorts start buying up shares on the open market to cover.

If I had to guess this is why Shitron opened it's **stupid whore mouth** about PLTR bae yesterday, they've probably already taken a substantial short position as early as the 16th, if not earlier, and fear the power of our autism.

"Flip side: Citron is right a lot, too...",0.69,"Since there's a lot of newer ~~gamblers~~ investors on WSB, there's been a lot of anger directed at Citron research for a tweet that probably cost 90% of WSB their portfolio cause they bought 11/27 PLTR calls. An expensive lesson in buying 0/1/2 DTE options.

There was a post that was, well...a ""cope"" post which was painting Citron as essentially always being wrong. ""What about NIO!!"" - yes, they got that wrong. But there's multiple stocks they've covered that dropped 90%+, including a Pharmaceutical GIANT (Valeant Pharma). They're right a lot more than they are wrong. Do your own DD [here](https://citronresearch.com/category/citron_reports/page/2/) (archive of the reports they've posted). I looked through some of their bearish calls, and here's a small list.

PLTR may well recover and go to 50+, or it may continue to drop to $20. The point of this post is to provide the other side of the coin - Citron gets it right a lot. Do they get some wrong too? Sure, but for the newer 'investors' that haven't been in the game for a long time, there's a reason a simple tweet from Citron can cause a stock to go from +26% to -4% in a shortened trading day.

"It isnt a meme, its a solid play. Gamestop is a once in a lifetime >3000% return opportunity.",0.94,"**READ THIS RETARDS. SHORT SQUEEZE MEANS MORE RETURNS THAN PLTR, NIO, XPEV, EVERY MEME STOCK COMBINED. GME** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

**Squeeze?**

Its gotten to the point where short interest is over 100%, meaning that more than 100% of the available shares of gamestop have been shorted. How does this happen? Shares can be borrowed, sold, then borrowed from the buyer (making two people technically borrowing the same 1 share). This is insane and has never happened before without causing a short squeeze. (look up volkswagen short squeeze chart to see what it looks like when short interest exceeds 100%).

[https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME\/key-statistics?p=GME](https://preview.redd.it/n8sr8ifnww161.png?width=840&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3f3ef131a7d5bdee19acd4c6bd8196fad9c66aa)

So if gamestop stock goes up, the shorts will have to cover, which is literally impossible since theyve shorted over 100% of shares, so the price will be driven to an absolute retard height. But, whats gonna make gamestop go up? how are the shorts wrong?

**Consoles**

Well, the obvious is console sales, but thats not really it. Yes, the consoles will help, however more importantly there are key indicators that gamestop is not going bankrupt. Recently, they just paid off a metric fuckton of debt *voluntarily* which means they have the cash to do that, aka not bankrupt. People are literally camping out at gamestop for consoles. They will not struggle.

**Cohen**

Also, they are getting the help from ryan cohen, who successfully competed with amazon by launching an online pet store called Chewy, which made him a billionaire. This is good news for gamestop because he will help pivot them from brick and mortar towards a more digital world, which means gamestop now has realistic growth prospects. Also, there is rumors that cohen will announce a tender offer, which would immediately trigger a short squeeze, end of story. Cohen has openly critiqued the BoD about their '20th century mindset' so it is likely he is going to take over soon.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/former-chewy-ceo-ryan-cohen-urges-gamestop-to-become-the-amazon-of-video-games.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/former-chewy-ceo-ryan-cohen-urges-gamestop-to-become-the-amazon-of-video-games.html)

&#x200B;

[Also, massive completely random spikes in volume off seemingly no news indicate that cohen is buying up shares. ](https://preview.redd.it/e19xcu0qxw161.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=81f7c9aeb4df33cc2d416f7fda3b2e8ee257cc43)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Positioning**

They have also positioned themselves to benefit from non traditional 'brick and mortar' revenue streams. Another thing that gamestop has is online revenue sharing with sony, which means they will be benefiting from digital game sales. They also just announced that they would be selling TVs on their website, showing that they are positioning themselves to compete as an online retailer.

[https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/10\/15\/21517970\/gamestop-revenue-sharing-microsoft-xbox-digital-downloads-games](https://preview.redd.it/cijd0o25xw161.png?width=1518&format=png&auto=webp&s=310955852b0224bfff2fc36825d50a741475f46c)

[https://gamerant.com/gamestop-vizio-tvs/](https://gamerant.com/gamestop-vizio-tvs/)

\^Link about TVs.

**The move:**

Buy as many shares as you can and hold. Set a limit sell on all your shares for at least $500, to make sure that you dont miss the squeeze. That alone would be a 3,233% gain.

Important note: This quarters earnings will likely not be a catalyst for a short squeeze. It is likely that there will be a run up and then small dump after. Remember, the shorts are working hard to fuck over longs. Dont be a retard and fall for it. Buy up the dips.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TLDR: BUY GAMESTOP SHARES, HOLD WITH A LIMIT SELL OF AT LEAST $500/share**

Is $PLTR Actually Expected to Reach $40...,0.69,"Hello fellow Redditors,

I have been trading with RobinHood for about a year now, and have seen some pretty great results. I have made about $1800 in profit over the last year, which is not bad considering I started with only $120. That being said, I have always invested in stocks that I researched on my own; I never really followed any of the ""hype"" on Reddit when buying stocks. Anyway, lately I've been seeing numerous posts concerning $PLTR and how people are hoping they reach $40 by this Monday. I did some research on the company and to be frank, I have no idea if I should invest in it or not. I mean, if the stock hits $40+, that would be great but how likely is that (I am genuinely wondering if it is expected to hit $40)? Should I follow the hype and invest the $1920 in my account in $PLTR? Thanks in advance for any feedback!

Led by Peter Thiel, who wrote Zero to One. He's crazy smart. Cofounded Paypal. Early investor in Facebook. BFF of Daddy Elon Musk.

Palantir doesn't have a direct competitor. The closest would probably be $SNOW or $CRM's Tableu. Both of which are worth over 75 billion.

Ark Invest Internet ETF bought the dip with 3,660 additional shares today. Currently has well over 1 million shares.

Andrew Left of Citron Research has a history of bad calls. He was right about half the time (50%) He was wrong about NVDA, NIO, SHOP, AMD, and TSLA. We all know how those turned out.

George Soros ""regrets investing in PLTR"" for morality reasons, NOT financial ones. There is no doubt that AI and Big Data are the future.

Yeah, it may easily go up on Monday, but that's not the point. My point is that these straw dicks aren't admitting that they were wrong, got lost in the hype, and forgot about market volatility. 

They either claim they knew all along that it was gonna dip, despite blatantly denying it in previous posts

Or

They blame everything on one tweet... come on...

And, after telling all the incompetent noobs to go all-in on Friday, you have the audacity to tell them they have paper hands for not holding like you are? even though the last time they took advice from you they lost their entire savings account?

Today I bought high like an idiot, 3,000 shares at $31.50 PLTR, and sold 30 12/11 $34C for $5.10 each. Assuming this stock moons like the meme that it is, and they end up being exercised, that will still be $19,800 profit.

Will it change my life? Definitely not. But it’s a solid ROI when these premiums are be sold at astronomical prices.

Crayon magic and blow off tops,0.92,"Hello fellow retards.

I think this is becoming more relevant since the meme trade is so hot these days. I try to do TA sometimes and it's useless most of the time for me. Either I'm not good enough to do it, or it doesn't matter that much. It finally did something though by suggesting that I should bail on CRSR. The main problem with this is that the evidence doesn't seem to show up until the very end and sometimes you're already fucked by market open.

A blow off top is what happens at the end of a ridiculous rally where the price shoots up one last time before everything crashes and burns. Very often before a blowoff top you will have a final furious rally with volume that is very high, usually the highest volume day of the current rally, then a sell off that spirals out of control as people panic to grab profits and escape. This will be confirmed by the volume and fury of the sell off session.

\*See CRSR and JKS

I was actually looking at PLTRs chart last night and I didn't see the same definite signs of a complete meltdown. I wrote on my chart that a probable dip was coming, but no crash. Was gonna post it, but didn't feel like getting stormed by PLTR gang.

**TL;DR -- When the money flow indicates weakness and that money is flowing out of the stock, but the price is rising it's a pretty good signal to GTFO.**

&#x200B;

CRSR blow up

[CRSR had a beautiful setup to blow up. The green line below the main chart is the Chaikin Money Flow \(CMF\). It measures the money flowing in\/out of the stock. You can see that during the initial mooning phase, the money just keeps pouring in. Towards, the end the money starts flowing out, but the price is still going up. Basically smart money is getting the fuck out and giving their bags to the last group of FOMOers that will pay anything to buy.](https://preview.redd.it/yxj5rdl7gu161.jpg?width=1875&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee60e6728b93be394e51f5d9c1139cf4eccd93da)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

JKS Meltdown

&#x200B;

[JKS was my first experience with this and of course I nearly lost everything. Almost the same exact story. Money flow keeps rising during the earliest parts of the rally, but then hits a high and begins to trail off. Smart money heads for the door as a final group of FOMO buyers jumps in, but you can see that the final spike in money flow is much lower than before. The JKS rally is actually one of my favorites because not only did it once hit 90 RSI and keep mooning, but the RSI stayed in the overbought zone for 3 weeks straight. One of the great legends of our time.](https://preview.redd.it/c07ndifrhu161.jpg?width=1611&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abf51f75fee9f9aae9baccfeeb3e5964427108c3)

Why we got played on PLTR today,0.67,"This is old news take a look at this advice from 1936:

John Maynard Keynes supplied the answer in 1936, in ""The General Theory of Employment Interest and Money,"" by comparing the stock market to a beauty contest. He described a newspaper contest in which 100 photographs of faces were displayed. Readers were asked to choose the six prettiest. The winner would be the reader whose list of six came closest to the most popular of the combined lists of all readers.


""The best strategy, Keynes noted, isn't to pick the faces that are your personal favorites. It is to select those that you think others will think prettiest. Better yet, he said, move to the ""third degree"" and pick the faces you think that others think that still others think are prettiest. Similarly in speculative markets, he said, you win not by picking the soundest investment, but by picking the investment that others, who are playing the same game, will soon bid up higher.""


Y'all made a shit load of memes, Citron reacted to the beauty contest, then you ignored the fact that the big brain move was actually about you reacting to Citron driving trades based on your memes.


I walked away making money because I have worked at a couple of other jobs outside of Wendy's, and can see more than 2 weeks into the future. I played 3rd-degree chess with your bullshit.


I know you guys can't read so TLDR: The more memes WSB produces, the more idiots jump in the game, the more money to be made on the other side.

HOLD PLTR it's still going up, but Y'all showed your hand. Maybe lock this sub unless you want this Citron dude calling the bluff every week.

How you can become a guaranteed BILLIONAIRE and TRES COMMA CLUB member with PLTR!,0.87,"Ok you retards, here's how we can all become billionaires with PLTR.

There's two options but both are almost mathematically guaranteed to make you mad gains to enter the TRE COMMA CLUB. This is science and math and shit nah I'm sayin?

Option 1: 
Buy PLTR 40C 1/21/22 for like 9$. That's like over a year away, which is a millennia. 

Option 2:
Buy PLTR 40C 11/19/21 for like 8$. That's like almost a year away, which is near a millennia anyways.


Considering PLTR has like tripled in stock in the last month, that means using basic regression and science, in 13 months when this call expires the price of PLTR is gonna be 1170$ which is 3x every month for 13 months. That's just math works you retards. You have a year to hit this 1170$ mark, which is fairly reasonable. Tesla went from 180 to 3k in over a year, so relatively tiny PLTR can go 30$ to 1200$ easily.

Results:
Both options are gonna be worth like 140k each, so it'll 17.5k multiply your money. For you retards who can't math like me that means if you put your life savings of 60k into either option, you'll have a Billion dollars and finally enter the TRES COMMA CLUB.

Putting PLTR in Perspective with Multiples,0.82,"Hi all - not here to sway you autists, but just wanted to provide some multiples and comps to get your opinions on PLTR in terms of valuation. I don’t own a position but wish I did. Haven’t followed the stock or any news other than on here the past week. 

Some high growth software / analytics companies 

- SNOW: ‘21 EV / Rev = ~100x
- DDOG: ‘21 EV / Rev = ~ 40x
- MongoDB: ‘21 EV / Rev = ~ 25x
- Alteryx: ‘21 EV / Rev = ~ 15x
- JFROG: ‘21 EV / Rev = ~ 30x
—
- PLTR ‘21 EV / Rev = ~ 50x

The above isn’t very helpful as it doesn’t reflect growth. But an EV/Rev/growth multiple does. Below are 2021E EV/Rev/Growth multiples, which give a better picture of how expensive a multiple is incorporating its growth 

- SNOW: ‘21 EV / Rev / Growth = ~1.2x 
- DDOG: ‘21 EV / Rev / Growth = ~1.0x
- MongoDB: ‘21 EV / Rev / Growth = ~1.0x
- Alteryx: ‘21 EV / Rev / Growth = ~0.75x
- JFROG: ‘21 EV / Rev / Growth = ~ 1.1x
—
- PLTR: ‘21 EV / Rev / Growth = ~ 1.5x

Estimates could not be reflecting recent news that would push its estimates growth rate higher, 
 lowering its multiple and making it cheaper on a relative basis. Maybe new estimates will normalize PLTR multiples above as estimates lag news but stock price is almost simultaneous.",2020-11-27 19:51:29

Yeah who the fuck cares if Citron thinks it will drop a measly $8 eoy when most everyone who knows about this company is buying for the long play. Fucking idiots. Yes sell your stock for a measly 2-3 x profit. The big boys are here for the long game",2020-11-27 19:42:13
DD on citron and how retarded they are,0.96,"Alright retards, I know we are all pissed at citron and rightfully so. I know people are panicking and saying should I hold should I sell and all this dumb shit. I went through their tweets and picked out some noteworthy picks they’ve had.

NIO - citron short November 13 - stock up 20% since then

NNOX - September 15 citron tweets - up over 30% since then

PLUG - august 21 citron tweets negative - up over 100%

RST - this one was a long that citron estimated would get bought out for 50-60 - got bought out at 30

STMP - citron says SHOP is going to buy it - stock down 20% since

GSX - they’ve been tweeting for over a year so I couldn’t find their first short but it’s up from when they started tweeting

PTON - this is actually hilarious because they posted an article on March 13 that it was going to 5$ - it’s over 100 retard

SHOP - shorts it in October of 2017 saying they’re doing illegal shirt, shorts again in April of 2019 - it’s up a billion % since 2017 and 426% since the April tweet

TLRY - can’t find tweet but I was trading when he tweeted. It was around 80 and went to fuckin 300 before it crashed

JMIA - can’t find tweet but google it. They literally called Jumia a fraud at the end of 2019 and now they’re fucking long.

Are we seriously gonna listen to these fucking retards? They didn’t provide ANY evidence of why PLTR should pull back.

Why did PLTR dropped - explained for dummies,0.93,"It is obvious that MM sold huge packets at every dollar that PLTR dropped, so they make your calls expire worthless and collect your premiums. 

Many of us had positions before today and some of us had no money left to support the drop. 

Citron helped dropping the price (by a lot) but they made huge mistakes in the past. We are bigger MMs than them, trust me on this one. 

Many investors sold their positions to collect profits (pussies) and hopefully buy again lower on Monday.

BUT.... 

The problem is that MANY of you retards got scarred like the fking sissies you are and closed your positions too. WE are to blame. We left me playing the game on their own, with their term. In other words, you bitched out. 

When we say to the moon we fucking mean it. When we say “let’s teach citron a lesson” we fucking mean it. We meant it with TSLA NIO and more. Now we are doing it again. 

Fuck your pathetic girlfriends good is the weekend, because in Monday they will leave your beta ass for the alphas that kept their stocks in the correction.

Recap of my PLTR day,0.97,"So my plan before I went to bed last night was to put down $8.5k worth of PLTR Call Options at opening 11/27 for either:

60 contracts @ 40c Dec 4th

or

86 contracts @ 31c 0DTE (Nov 27)

As it turns out I didn’t realize my TD account wasn’t yet approved for Level 2 Options, and I had already transferred my money into TD, so it was too late to switch to RH :/

Ending up buying 262 shares @ $31.39 and then another 72 shares before closing @ $27.69

TLDR; I’m in 10k to PLTR and down $1k and some change as of closing 📉

Bill Gates has invested $500 million of his own monies into this company and it is also backed by Tesla co-founder JB Staubel. They plan to install these batteries in VW's by 2025. This is quite possibly the battery company that makes mass EV transition a reality. They already have 18 patents on solid state technology that promises to resolve the obstacle of overcoming dendrites using LLZO, and while leaving out the details, Jagdeep Singh, the QuantumScape CEO, said that his team had worked out “hundreds” of bugs, and finally emerged with a working metallic lithium battery.

Sell high then buy the dips because I'm pretty sure it will happen again but less extreme than today. I fucked up by being impatient but I'm not doing that again.

Idk shit about Citron and Andrew Left besides they like fingering themselves in the corner while their wives that wants to divorce them gets gangbanged. Don't be scared of them like I was earlier today.

A calm explanation of PLTRs price action today,0.96,"1. Citron Research declared a short with a price target of $20. Although they didn’t give any fundamental reasoning behind their short(other than saying it’s a casino, whatever that means), this inevitably lead to some traders selling their stocks to secure profits.
Citron has been proven wrong almost all of the times. Very recently with NIO. But also with TSLA, SHOP etc.

2. Traders securing profits. Some traders don't like to hold over the weekends and given that PLTR has runup so much in this week, it is very natural for them to secure profits.

3. Healthy correction. This is pretty obvious. As much as the sub likes to pump this stock. Without a healthy correction, a stock will not really moon. AAPL, AMZN, TSLA etc all saw their corrections in their days.

4. Shorter trading day and being the day after thanksgiving. This is an anecdotal reason, but generally there has been a pattern of correction in this day.

That's all there is really. Even if there was no reason, you should all have expected a pullback after such a huge runup.
Saying that it will go to moon without some bumps would be obviously acting like a shill.

Though I must say there is one note of caution in the options market. The numbers are not really in favour of options buyer any more in this stock.

I would recommend buying PLTR shares directly or selling puts FOR NOW.",2020-11-27 18:09:43

Reminder about CITRON for PLTR holders,0.86,"If you haven't heard yet, Andrew Left of Citron Research tweeted about PLTR this morning and is likely the cause of the downturn today.

He pulled a nearly identical move a few weeks ago with NIO. Conspicuously, he made both of these tweets on a Friday. My suspicion is that he does this to tank a stock on a day where he can benefit from 0DTE puts, whether he's buying them or others working for him are doing so.

Less time value = cheaper contracts.

For everyone thinking the PLTR party is over, don't lose hope yet. Just like with NIO, Left is likely publishing these hit pieces to create a short term opportunity.",2020-11-27 18:05:05

Jim Cramer I know you have your little intern shits in here, so I challenge you. 

If WSB has a running total over these numbers you have to: 

$100,000 (easy)- fuck off and leave us alone

$300,000 (medium)- shoutout PLTR, THC(B), and APXT. You don’t have to compliment and pump them, just call them a meme stock if you want. Just talk about them. 

$500,000 (hard)- Give us a shoutout on CNN saying we aren’t totally shitheads. Just stop attacking us and say something decent. 

$1,000,000+ (Autist level)- Put this post everywhere you can including CNN showing just how generous us tards are. Also donate $2,000 to your choice of charity and ask people on all platforms including CNN to do the same. If people as “stupid” and “terrible” as us can I’m sure you people with high morals should have no issue. 

I know this is a long shot guys but with all the people donating here and maybe this causing a positive feedback loop we can pull off another autist feet. 

Worse case- More people who need food get food, doesn’t sound too bad if you ask me.

PLTR Bull Case,0.91,"TL;DR Buy more PLTR

Something to remember about economics in general, is that it is the only science in the world where if enough people start to believe the same thing, it actually becomes true. 

Citron has publicly tried to erode confidence in PLTR’s valuation for profit. Many people used today as a profit realization day. We expected this. One (half) day of trading means nothing. This is a blip. 

PLTR has massive potential because they have what many do not: the “in” to government contracts with the ability to crank up AI tech when needed. 

“Oh no, PLTR has a little red action?!” So what? We’re still up 50% THIS WEEK.

This is one of those times when you wish you didn’t have paper hands. And for those of you who have diamond hands, I’m excited to ride the train with you into 2021.

Positions:
Several call contracts at $30+ expiring December 2020 through mid 2021

Edit: Market closed with PLTR down ~4.3% after a week where every other day was double digit % green. This is the worst the short sellers could do? This is nothing.

PLTR and you - Dumb money guide from Professional Investor,0.99,"PLTR got you down because it swung 20% in a day and you lost all you money? Maybe you should understand something about trading options.

I previously talked about how WSB was moving the market.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0ctkd/why\_wsb\_is\_now\_running\_the\_entire\_equity\_market/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0ctkd/why_wsb_is_now_running_the_entire_equity_market/)

In this post, i will talk to you about how to time your option trades and positioning.

See you should calculate something called implied payout. Go ahead, go into excel and build a spreadsheet that shows how much you would make from options versus holding the shares. Theoretically you should see options generating a higher delta (to expiry) than the underlying because you are taking higher leverage and theta risk. A share will not expire.  As you can see below. Back on 11/20/2020. A call option on PLTR exhibited deltas of somewhere between 2-6x based on a target price of 30-50. You are being compensated for the risks of the option. More important, upward sloping delta represents a rational risk market.

https://preview.redd.it/xueyshdejt161.png?width=1271&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdd4d2dbd2fc364a1962e1a1f5dcbe547588a121

Now lets look at the same option earlier today at the Peak of PLTR of around $32/share, the delta has fallen down so much its down to 2-3x for if Palantir hits 40-80 by the time of expiration.

https://preview.redd.it/i0wntoa0ht161.png?width=1017&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb4ccfbfb5b4ef490388507a25c90d6693e9e579

For those who don't understand what this means. It is a terrible risk adjusted return, by far the worst that I have ever seen in the option market. You can tell the option pricing is completely irrational at this point because the delta curve barely upward sloping.

Now look at the OTM strikes, it was at such a point that going up 50% in would result in the same performance has holding the share price. Again, you are talking about poor delta in all probable ranges.

https://preview.redd.it/uqzb0lxiht161.png?width=1017&format=png&auto=webp&s=a91a064e27afcf5a73f78247ce530a1f9d5bed13

Now why does this matter? Well it means the option buying is near exhausted at this point. So the gamma covering dynamic that I talked about in my previous reddit post is coming to a short term end (even if the long bull run is just beginning) So you should dump your calls and look for a more attractive curve/payoff. Or if you want to participate, switch your options into shares for better risk adjusted returns.

How can tell if the sell-off is exhausted? Look for a payoff/delta curve that is closer to the first graph. Rinse, repeat and enjoy your tendies.",2020-11-27 17:33:39

Do you have any justification, proof, hard data on why you think this company will tank? I see these posts and they never provide a single reason for their position. Meanwhile, Bulls are posting DD left and right.

Brokerage option for my fellow Europoors:,0.91,"**I want to state that I in no way represent either of the companies below and I am not being paid or otherwise endorsed to write about them. I'm just trying to make some of you autisits tendies so we don't look like retards to the rest of the group.**

I'm seeing a lot of talk from you about not having access to certain US stocks and options, and complaining about how long it takes to deposit into your accounts. I have come to inform you of the tastyworks and currencyfair combo and bask you in tendies.  

Tastyworks is a US based brokerage that offers low fees on options and no fees on stocks (it also doesn't have hidden fees like all those ""no-fees"" brokers). It only allows you to trade in dollars, however it lets you use a company called Currencyfair to deposit funds into. Currencyfair is a currency converter that lets you transfer the currency you converted to another registered account. They also have an option for instant deposit and conversion. I've found that if I instant deposit into Currencyfair and then have it transferred to Tastyworks by 14:00 GMT the money will be in my brokerage account ready for use by open **the next day**. One of the best things is that neither company has a minimum deposit required to open an account, so you can start trading at any time. The downsides is that their customer support takes 24-48 hours to respond and are only available during trading hours, however I've only ever needed to contact them to inquire about account options. They offer a mobile, browser, and desktop app so you can trade anywhere with an internet connection and unlike RH it never crashes. 

**TLDR:** Currencyfair transfers into Tastyworks take 24 hours. 

**Tastyworks is accepting applications from:** Andorra, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, French Polynesia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Namibia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, UK, and Uruguay.

APXT: Merger with AvePoint,0.96,"
APXT has reached a deal to merge with AvePoint, the largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider. The company is being valued at $2 billion and will trade under AVPT.

APXT has a huge client base already, at an estimated 7 million members. 25% of the Fortune 500 uses Avepoint.

'AvePoint’s 7 million customers represent a 3% share of Microsoft’s 250 million 365 users. AvePoint believes it can get to 10% share and Microsoft will hit 500 million users in the future, good for 50 million AvePoint future customers.'

Addressable market: $33 billion by 2022.

The company ALREADY HAS REVENUE (unlike other SPACs), which is expected to total $148 million by the end of this year. A large % of this is recurring revenue as well, with 78% of revenues in 2020 estimated to be recurring. Expected revenue CAGR of 30% to 2022.

**5-time winner of Microsoft Partner of the Year award.**

Management: 'Apex is led by former Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig'. These are huge, knowledgeable players. They can turn this company into a goliath, especially with the extra capital from a SPAC.

Big name backers: Sixth Street Partners, Goldman Sachs,

Big advisors on the deal, including Goldman Sachs, Evercore and Citigroup.

This seems similar to the other data related plays weve had this year \*cough\* PLTR \*cough\*. Not the same type, but definitely in a growth market with strong margins. Also allows you to diversify away from EVs a bit.

The SPAC hasn't run yet, currently trading at $13.90 per share, so this has a lot of room to run. Very little downside, but huge potential upside.

I'm talking of course about Youtube-Minecraft, the social-network gaming platform we **WILL NOT MENTION** until after it IPOs. Algo's scrape the ticker so go PLTR nuts with it once options are enabled (minimum 3 days after IPO). Until then don't blow our cover autists.

Serious discussion about donations,1.0,"I'm loving the generousity on this subreddit this past month. Can someone make a sticky post of good charities so we can spread our own retarded profits around? I'm on board now to donate as well since this huge surge in pltr is honestly incredible in a time like this.

Personally i got laid off mid october and the unemployment checks havnt gone through since then. This stock and others like it have allowed my family to still have a good Thanksgiving and holidays and would love to help others who didnt get this chance.

Love you retards.",2020-11-27 14:18:28

PLTR - THETA GANG Low Risk Entry,0.99,"Alright, I know lots of you people are cautious about entering PLTR after the massive run up. Instead of posting rocket emojis and green dildos I am posting something that you tards might actually find useful.

For those that can afford 100 shares, selling puts is a great way to collect premium and give yourself downside protection. The IV on this is crazy so PUTS give you quite the incentive. 

a 25.00 PUT that expires in 7 days at a 25.00 strike is selling for 1.50. For you to lose money, the stock would have to drop below 23.50 in the next 7 days and if it does, you essentially buy the stock for 23.50. 

If the stock continues to rise, continue selling weeklies and collecting premium. Just make sure you know what you are doing with options as selling a put could end up requiring you to buy 100 shares.

When selling puts, you are selling a put to open.

Not investing advice, just a clever little way to make some money.

[supplychaindive.com/news/coronavirus-vaccine-supply-chain/579835](https://supplychaindive.com/news/coronavirus-vaccine-supply-chain/579835)

So, after PLTR, invest in sand companies? Someone want to figure out who is going to be making the right kind of glass and/or supplying the right kind of sand?

I found a few companies, Schott, Watson-Marlow, Accuglass. But I'm not the best at digging up who makes what and from where.

This pdf says that the particular material needed for syringe vials is borosilicate tubing.

My thought is that if they are planning on making vaccines for at least 50% of the population, thats going to be a lot of glass. The PDF says they expect up to two years to produce enough glass for the US alone.

Probable candidate: Corning, Inc.

PSA: Donate stock not cash,0.94,"I see a lot of donations happening recently. Remember, if you are up a lot, it is more tax advantageous to donate stock than to donate cash. This way, not only do you not pay taxes on capital gains, but you deduct the higher amount as a charitable donation. 

Say you bought PLTR at $10. It is now $30.

If you were to sell and donate cash, you’d pay $5-7 capital gains leaving you with $23-25 to donate. Come tax time, you’d have $23-25 in charitable donation deduction. 

If you were to donate PLTR, you’d be donating $30. No taxes paid. And you’d have $30 in charitable donation deduction.",2020-11-27 13:37:37

And they say WSB is dead,0.94,"Two weeks back I read some mouth breather come on and complain about the state of wsb. While I have lurked for a long time I have been commenting for the past year.( they finally let me use a keyboard, used to smash all the keys and break my desk) Its been a great fucking year for wsb you incessant cucks. Here is why...

We all know the tales of ironyman and the legendary live look into a humans face as his sole leaves his body with a giant GUH... we all remember the MU pumps. Lord and savior Martin shrekli(free my dog) .This was wsb when it was riding high with autists that would YOLO their student loans, take bets that they had absolutely  no clue what level of financial instrument they were playing with but still..... nothing compared to wsb in 2020. 

The crash in feb to March caused gain and loss porn never fuckin seen on this sub, caused a man to literally DRINK HIS OWN PISS. It caused Cramer to unleash the plebaziod force 3000 of  chads and soon to be Karen's to scour the boards of wsb to hopefully finally make a stock pick that doesn't crash and burn the second he talks about it. Thousands were gained. Millions were lost. It was a time for the ages. 

Which brings to me to the point I couldn't make in the shit I just spewed above. 

We have someone who is on the verge of preparing to eat his own shit. This sub has 1.6 almost 1.7 million subscribers with no doubt millions more lurking. 

Millions of people will witness a man eat his own shit on this sub, this will go down in history books and be a moment in time remembered forever. Wsb was never dead you incessant newbie retards. The autists remain. They provide less memes because how the FUCK  would you compete with a man drinking his own body excrement.


Next stop 2021, make some retards two dudes one cup this bitch and WSB will go down as the greatest collection of retards and money blowers this world has ever fucking seen.

This took me like two weeks to write, back to slamming my head into the wall because I can't figure out how to get the straw out of the wrapper and into the juice box, helmet on of course. 

Tldr: wsb is en route to Mars, leaving you slop face ultagaybear sub zero account sitting bitxh boys holding tsla on the moon thinking you know what peak wsb even was.

The PLTR -TSLa connection,0.91,"For those who don’t know, Peter thiel and Elon musk were both founders at PayPal and still buddies.
They had separate companies which merged to form PayPal ( also look up PayPal mafia) and they served as CEO at different times. Thiel was CEO when it got acquired by EBay.

Thiel is the first outside investor in SpaceX. He didn’t invest in TSLA because he was not sure about the whole Green technology revolution.

Thiel was also the first investor on Facebook.

Thiel is one of the co founders at PLTR..

  Watching you tards donate some of your easy earnings made me happy, and made me think.

  I spent the last 4 years in the Marine Corps and that was a blessing. Hell of a ride, got to do and learn shit most people only see in video games, and got to see more countries in 4 years than most do in a life time. The type of poverty I got to see and work in reminds me what a Godsend it is to be here, to be able to dick around with stock for 2 weeks (not even options yet) and with your autistic guidance make an easy 8k. 

  Between real work, we got to do a bit of charity work in the various places we'd put our boots on. It blew my mind how happy and excited some of those kids were just to see some dudes in uniforms help them build a fence for the orphanage or play some soccer with them. Hell, seeing a kid get excited by an MRE is just ridiculous.  But other than a short visit we didn't have shit to give these kids but a little bit of our time. This year I'd like to give something.

  Now, I ask that you help me make some fast tendies so that by Xmas day I can cash out a few grand and buy some orphanage kids some gifts or supplies or whatever my smarter than me wife tells me they need. This will be an orphanage in Lviv, Ukraine.

&#x200B;

  Give me some good calls to place, I will free up about 2-3k tomorrow morning. If we can help a guy eat  his own shit at PLTR 40, we can just as easily continue to donate some earnings to shit we care about.  I'm more than happy to update here if you guys are interested, I'd really like to do this and I can't think of any finer motherfuckers than you all to help me out.",2020-11-27 03:44:24

Long Weed but Do NOT buy ACB,0.94," My fellow autists,

Happy thanksgiving you retards. Despite 2020 being by far the worst year in a long fucking time, there is plenty to be thankful for. I’m thankful for not being retarded enough to invest in ACB. For those of you less fortunate, let me explain.

In case you haven’t expanded the historical price chart view for ACB to further beyond a month yet, ACB has been on a one-way road down to dumpster land, and for good reason. This does NOT mean it’s prime for a ripping or that it is “undervalued.” 

\*\*\* Begin Analysis, feel free to skip \*\*\*

The company has historically been mismanaged. What once began as a pioneer in the cannabis market has now become the laughing stock of the cannabis giants. While the overall market grows at 30%, ACB has struggled on aligning on an effective sales strategy, even with a new CEO. They’ve historically focused on value (cheap) flower, which has lost demand as it continues to face steeper competition. Shifts to higher premium brands resulted in declines in revenue (ACB is basically the only cannabis company to have declining revenue) despite significantly higher investment costs. ACB’s early enthusiasm resulted in significant capacity that has since been recognized to far exceed demand (currently <20% utilization on its initial capacity), hampered by restrictive international policies around issuance of prescriptions. This excess capacity has resulted in declining cannabis prices, creating a double whammy for ACB.

These dynamics have led to a woeful financial picture. ACB burns $50-100M in cash a quarter. At least it’s for solid ROI investments right? Well let’s see…revenue went down this year across both medical and recreational as mentioned, gross margins continue to deteriorate (60% to -25%), and the business generates negative $3.4B in net income (and it continues to decline YoY). The last stat is largely due to a “write off of a few investments”. What that means is they closed a bunch of facilities, scrapped a shit-ton of inventory, and acknowledged that the companies they bought along the way were way too overvalued. ACB recently had an equity raise at $7.50 / share to raise $125M in an attempt to stay afloat. These processes take a ton of time. Instead of managing the business, management was likely spending most of their time for the past quarter marketing and getting investors to buy this junk. And once that money runs out in a quarter or two, they’ll likely try to do an even more sizeable equity raise (read: even more dilution for shareholders) to any unsophisticated investor willing to listen.

But what about federal legalization? Sorry to be a Debbie Downer, but it’s not happening anytime soon fellas. Biden has never been about it and I’d bet my left nut that Republicans hold onto the senate. While the democrat’s relatively liberal stance on the issue might allow for more widespread decriminalization, federal approval is needed to Aurora to enter the US THC market due to current regulations. And even on the off chance that marijuana becomes legalized federally, Aurora suffers from such a poor balance sheet that they may not even be able to afford to break into the market and take share from the existing well-capitalized, better run domestic incumbents.

Despite the gross mismanagement of the business, lackluster financial performance, poor regulatory outlook, and the massive drop in stock price over the year(s), the company continues to trade at a whopping 7x TEV/Revenue. Your grandkids will likely be dead before this thing ever sees a dollar on the bottom line). At 7x, the company trades like a high growth SaaS tech company, when in reality the company is on the brink of bankruptcy. It currently has twice as much debt as it does revenue, burns through $300M cash annually as mentioned above, and has only been able to stay afloat recently through equity raises which continue to get increasingly dilutive and unsustainable as the cash burn grows larger and the equity becomes more worthless. There are no debt sources (banks) or other institutional equity investors that would ever lend to this company.

\*\*\* End Rant, Feel free to Skip to Here \*\*\*

For those of you who skipped the last few paragraphs because there was too much autistic jargon in there, let me explain it to you with an example. Let’s say Pi Phi is the hottest sorority on your campus. If Pi Phi is a proxy for the weed industry, then Aurora is one of the founding members who used to only be kind of hot as she got her bid….then she got freshman fifteen, and is now about to get the sophomore 30. In an attempt to avoid getting retrohosed, she got lipo from the few willing doctors that were around at the expense of her health and family’s wealth. Unfortunately that lipo is only going to last a semester before it all comes right back. Moral: Go for Pi Phis, just not Aurora

In case it wasn’t made clear in the above example, this post is not meant to be a negative piece on the cannabis industry. I’m a strong believer in marijuana. It’s a $20B legal, $200B recreational market with a 30% projected revenue CAGR for the next few years. With the farm bill legalizing CBD, the market continues to move closer to decriminalization and legalization. Hell, this took me forever to write because I took a 10mg edible, had 5 snack breaks, and watched three episode of the Office then fell asleep last night before waking up this morning (read: afternoon) to finish writing. I don’t think I need to explain to you all that this is the future. All I’m advocating for is to invest your money in other weed stocks, not ACB because it looks cheap.

Aurora has the sporadic 30%-100% stock price jump days. For example: when announcing a new CEO, democrats winning the election, trump conceding the election, and retail FOMO/hedge fund squeezes. None of which did jack for the company fundamentally. But don’t be fooled by these dead cat bounces. You will get burned trying to chase these jumps, and if you’re buying calls, then the frat Vega Delta Theta will surely fuck you after fucking your wife, your wife’s boyfriend, and the non-fat chicks at Pi Phi. 

I’m also not advocating you to buy puts on this company. The economics on a put are abysmal, believe me I have one. Just don’t buy this shit expecting to get rich quick.

Best way to donate to charity: shares not cash!,0.95,"Let’s all make the most of our donations this holiday season. The best way to donate to charity is to send them your best performing shares of stock. That way you don’t pay taxes on any of your gains, and the charity is allowed to sell the stock immediately upon receipt and they don’t pay any taxes either. 

Steps to do this: 
1.	Find the charity’s brokerage account information online or send them a message asking for it. The instructions should include information to perform a Depository Trust Corporation (DTC) transfer 
2.	Call your broker or send them a secure message online to provide them with the DTC instructions, including the ticker symbol, number of shares, and specifically which shares or all shares of a stock holding that you’re looking to donate
3.	Your brokerage will take a few hours up to a few days, and the shares will disappear from your account. The charity will then send you a receipt for the entire value of shares that you sent them, which is tax deductible against the rest of your tendies for the year

Example scenario:
I bought $2k shares of NIO that are up 200%. I donated the $6k of stock to charity, so instead of having to pay taxes on $4k in gains I instead get to deduct the entire $6k on my taxes.

Example of a few DTC instructions for charities:

1.	Food bank example since it’s the holidays/Thanksgiving - Food Bank of Silicon Valley: https://www.shfb.org/give-help/stock-gifts/
2.	The founder of the ice bucket challenge passed away last weekend, so you could also give to ALS research (Lou Gehrig’s disease). This is a disease that has personally impacted my family as well: https://www.als.org/get-involved/ways-give/information-securities-brokers

Caveats: 
1.	Some of the newer, smaller brokers might not be setup to donate shares via DTC, so you’ll have to check with your broker to see if it will work. All of the traditional brokers like eTrade, Fidelity, etc are setup to handle this process
2.	Options are not a good idea to send because of the potential volatility and liquidity that is forced upon the charity. So more liquid, straightforward instruments like regular common stock such has PLTR, NIO, GME is the best way to donate

 PS. The ultimate charitable gift is to buy more shares of PLTR to raise all of WSB out of poverty

Edit: looks like it’s also better if you’ve owned the shares for more than a year. Otherwise you can only deduct your cost basis, but you still get to avoid paying taxes on the gains either way.

Price target legit?,0.67,"Hey guys. I was doing some research in PLTR, and I noticed the price target is super fucked, like [18 is highest](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PLTR/research-ratings) .

Aditionally, like another post mentioned, there are only [12.29% institutional ownership](https://fintel.io/so/us/pltr) . That, in my eyes, meabs 2 things. We control it, so it will snowball up probablly, but if institutional dump, paper hands will dump too. It could really go either way. Now I don't see any reason to dump, but it just seems kinda weird.

That said, I made over 200% on my CFDs since last week, so I'm not complaining, I'm just curious why it's like this. No doubt it will go up more, but really this growth may not be sustainable, and I feel like at some point there will be a huge correction. Either that or the boomers will go full retard and put it on a colision trajectory with Voyager, sending it out of our solar sistem.

I'm poor as fuck, but if I had more than two zeros in my account this is how I'd do it:

1. Let a meme stock take off
2. Buy what the dumbasses are selling. Encourage the hype machine.
3. Let it go on long enough that even the wary investors, those who started with just $100 or even $1000 invested start pouring in everything they've got. 
4. Once it looks like enough ""traders"" are ""all in,"" they've maxed out their credit cards, liquidated their other positions ... there's literally no more money left for them to gamble - and I own enough of the stock now to pretty much control the market - I sell everything.
5. What started as a gold rush instantly becomes a flash crash. The memers watch their ""investments"" melt away, as I flood the market and drown them all.

So yeah. I guess, be careful out there boys. This could be a trap.

Hidden Gem: MP Materials (MP),0.9,"I know everyone is talking about PLTR but it's not a bad idea to take out some gains into something else.   I have made a killing in PLTR but there's another stock that's not talked about at all with many surprising factors. 

MP Materials just gone public via SPAC with Fortress Value Acquisition Corp.   Let's just start with what REE is.   REE is rare earth elements,  I won't go into the details but basically think of permanent magnets.   They are used in  fighter jets,  MRI,  Cellphones etc.    Most importantly what we autist love to hear is they are in EVs and wind turbines which is the hottest sectors right now other than weed.  

I won't go into too much details because you autist with add get lost after the first paragraphs at best.  But as of now the whole market is completely dominated by China and that's why Trump signed an executive order to bring REE supply chain back to domestic at all cost.   This will continue regardless of Biden or Trump because it is crucial for the development of the important industries as well as defense.  China has threatened to cut US off from these precious metals and has done so with Japan for disputes in 2010. 

As of now everything, I mean 100%, is sent back to China and it is refined and turned into alloys and oxides then sent back.   If America want to make EV and turbines domestically the demand is huge.   This is a EV long term play so get in early. 


Why MP?  There are so many REE companies out there? 

- MONOPOLY domestic play. Actually have a functional mine from bankruptcy before.  Now it is under new management and is actually functional unlike other companies.   If you know anything about mining you would know to get a mine functional would take 5 to 10 years not even counting infrastructure.    The REE price is so low to compete we won't be seeing any real competition soon because it is not cost effective to develop a mine. Most REE companies are just a dream where they suddenly wake up and get grants from DOD and everything just magically happens into a 10 bagger overnight.  Only other real non Chinese competitor is Lynas but they are Aussie owned. 

- MP is one of the world's biggest mine in the world

- 1 of 3 companies to receive grants from Pentagon.  9. 6 million for seperation capabilities enhancement

- Phase 2 of 170million to upgrade to produce oxides and magnets

- Investors include Chamath, omega advisors & Slate path capital

- Third quarter revenue grew 52%; net income yoy increased 4x to 14. 6 million ,  adjusted EBITDA grew 159% yoy to 11. 6 million

- LOTS of factors such as EV, defense, China, and solar play all incorporated into one!!  Does it get batter than this?

3K --> 2.5M This Yolo Is Free,0.9,"**TLDR:** Donate to St. Jude for extra luck!

Hello WSB,

I want to run through a trade I made for anyone who is confused about the finer points of options trading and the mechanics of an infinite squeeze like the one we saw in TSLA, PLTR, etc.

I encourage anyone who has questions on options to ask in the comments. I see a lot of posts asking about the basics and I want to pay forward all the help I received on reddit.

Part 1: Sell Puts

I sold a GME Put at $30 for 1/15/2021. I got $1680 premium, which I used to fund the rest of my trade. Some may ask why I used this method instead of just using $3000 to buy calls? The answer is that this is to mitigate risk. If GME goes up but does not hit $30 by 1/15/2021, then some of my losses will be mitigated by the increase in the share price.

Part 2: Buy Calls

The next step was to buy 25 GME call options at $30 1/15/2021. This cost $1500, which I sourced from selling my put above. This means I control 2,500 shares of GME above the $30 price point.

Part 3: Forced Buying

Market Makers hedge the options they sell by buying 20% of the shares they have shorted in case the option ends in the money. This means that the MM who sold me those calls bought 500 shares of GME at $13.80 each. I removed $6,500 of shares from the market while only putting $1,500 on the line. As Delta changes, so will the number of shares the MMs are forced to buy as a hedge.

Part 4: The Short Squeeze to Infinity

GME already has 140% of their shares shorted. If MMs must buy shares and hold them until 1/15/2021, that makes it even more difficult for the shorts to cover. Short squeezes are violent and lead to huge increases in price. Overstock grew over 500% and VW briefly became the most valuable company due to similar strategies (Porsche literally bought tons of call options).

It is not impossible to see GME hit $100/share and maybe even $1,000/share (dream with me) since there is no precedent for a company that has this much short interest. If this occurs, then anyone who put 3K down on this trade would cash out with $2.5 Million.

Risk Mitigation

If we get a squeeze: If GME goes over $30, I will make mad money. Many retail investors will become millionaires off of GME.

If GME Stagnates: My cost basis for GME is $4.10 on 1,000 shares. Even if my calls expire worthless, that will only add $1.36/share to my cost basis. As long as we stay over $5.46, I will profit on my position. I plan to sell a few weekly CC to bring my cost basis back down to $4. I have 6 weeks to make back $1500 which means I probably only need to pledge 400 shares at .2 Delta.

If GME Crashes: Even if we crash 50%, I will be making money on the trade. I will sell CCs until my cost basis is $0.

Positions: GME short squeeze to infinity and beyond

Edit: the people wanted a screenshot, so I am giving the people what they want!

Fuck y'all and also I love you (first post),0.93,"(Repost bc automod got mad)

I've been an index man my whole life and done just fine. Picked a couple stocks occasionally but a couple stocks here and there doesn't make you any money so I quit it. Just recently I decided to get back into picking stocks when I started hearing abount Robinhood all the time, going for some growth/all or nothing plays. I can afford to lose a little money and I had low expectations. Well that was also the same time that I started seeing some WSB posts hit the front page. I had no fucking clue what I was laughing at but I was laughing. WSB memes are a gateway drug. 


$2,500 into RH. Bought WRK shares - a cardboard play - everyone is buying online, there is cardboard all over my house and all over my office. They were underperforming peers, got hit with the COVID, and the five of 10 bullets I read in their 10 point or whatever COVID recovery plan seemed good enough. Solid DD. Went in on Mercado Libre. Boring but solid growth. 


After laughing at all you degenerate fucks for a few months I thought to myself, yeah I should buy an option, without doing any research whatsoever. It's one option MIchael, how much could it cost? I purchased my first option. WRK $45C 12/18. Immediately went red. Didn't care. I needed more. First I had to figure out what the fuck an option was and figure out a better strategy. I knew I was ready when I could finally understand the shitposts. God damn I laugh my ass off reading this sub. And not just a little huff through the nose, like actual laughing. Joy I haven't felt in so long. 


I kept losing more on FDs. I didn't even know what an FD was. I just looked that up yesterday, but apparently that's what I was doing and I am the reason it's called an FD. In bed I would just look at who had earnings coming up and buy calls. I was getting fucked by my stupid plays. V, ACTI, ADM (what the fuck is that even? Bunch of soy bean farms. Who cares???), IP (more fucking cardboard). These stocks are not going to move. Just chipping away at my nut but I was expecting to lose so keep going right? Truly retarted. 


Then who came along? NIO. Fucking NIO. Made some money on calls while it was going from 20>30. Made back my losses and then some. Now I'm main lining heroin. Well shit now I know wtf to do right? Just do whatever WSB is doing. Now I'm staring at RH at work for 30 minutes straight thinking about selling one contract and reading posts on the shitter. Made money on CRSR. Made money on SOLO in the brief period it was popular and killed it on that trade. Now PLTR is fucking gold. I've bought and sold FDs. I'm in on a LEAP. I'm in for stock. TO🚀. THE🚀. MOON. 🚀


Now I can't sleep sometimes thinking about my plays that day and the plays I have to monitor the next day. I spend all the god damn zoom meetings I'm in all day staring at tickers. This should not be happening given the amount of money I'm playing with. I've got no positions worth more than a couple hundred bucks. I'm losing sleep over missing out on $20. SO FUCK YOU. BUT ALSO THANKS FOR MAKING ME MONEY, GETTING ME TO LEARN SOME NEW STUFF, FEELING LIKE PART OF THE GANG, AND MOSTLY MAKING ME LAUGH. In 48 days I'm up 75% thanks to WSB (mostly PLTR).

"From the person who brought you PLTR under $10, now I’m bringing you...",0.92,"PLTR. That’s right. It’s only ~tripled since I first presented the incredibly bullish flow about a month ago when the stock was under $10. And it’s just getting started.

My initial call: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jgnp0s/pltr_unusual_options_very_bullish

I bought PLTR for my 401k under 9 and am still holding. I bought PLTR calls when it was under 10, then at 15, 20, 25, and I’m still fucking buying.

Somebody already said they’ll buy me 1 share of NIO if PLTR hits 100 by the end of the year and I’m pretty sure they won’t deliver, but either way they’re in for a fucking surprise. 

I work at a large tech company and have had friends at various other large tech companies throughout the years. I’ve heard the same thing from every single person I’ve known who’s worked at Palantir: they’ll never sell a share. This lockup period means nothing to insiders who see growth and profitability beyond belief. Insiders don’t want to sell. Machine learning is just starting to take the world by storm and Palantir is the epitome of how to profit from this technology. 

Just so you fucks don’t get all pissy and disappointed that I don’t have a different golden play, remember, PLTR is just getting fucking started.

Oh and U 150c DEC 20, and 200c JAN 21, thank me later. Also check out APPN (but you gotta dance while the music’s playing).",2020-11-26 03:10:10

LGVW/Butterfly Networks a soon to be Meme Stonk,0.92,"Alright retards (TL;DR below) - Chinese EV and PLTR fever have taken over the sub and justifiably so. Since we have the attention span of a gnat, we need to find the next meme stonk. Enter Bill Gates, Butterfly Networks, and Long View Acquisition Corp.

What is it? Butterfly networks primary product is backed by Bill Gates (former second richest man on Earth) and is a handheld ultra sound machine that will improve medical diagnosis capabilities in the US and around the World.

How much does it cost?  The primary ultra sound machine has multiple packages but the best plan costs 3K one time cost that gets you the machine and the subscriptions service. They also have other plans that are based on a yearly subscription (not relevant for math purposes later). 

Company Basics. The company has $64.5M in revenue per year and has several competitors, none of which are backed by Bill Gates. The company is 9 years old and has received $350M in funding. They are merging with LGVW via a SPAC deal like so many companies this year and they have an actual product (looking at the incestuous loser Trevor Milton).

Why you should give a Fuck? Were going to mess around with some math (google research) to show how much money this company could make.

* There are 6,146 hospitals in the United States
* There are 230,187 private practices in the US
* There are an additional 164,500 hospitals world wide
   * Including 69,000 hospitals in India
   * and 30,000 hospitals in China

My sister is a nurse and she says that this is ""the coolest shit ever, but it will get lost easily"" so that means hospitals will be all about this shit and potentially have to buy more units when it gets lost in the anal probe repository. In other words, the tech itself is legit and this makes doctors/nurses/technicians lives easier. Lets do some numbers.

* Now, the average hospital (sister knowledge) has between 5-20 ultrasound machines floating threw a hospital.
   * If every hospital in the US had 5 machines that's $92M in revenue
* There's an additional 230K private practices in the United States
   * If each private practice had 1 machine, that's $690M
* Now, lets talk about international
   * There's estimated to be 164,500 hospitals worldwide which adds up to an additional $493M
   * Additionally, Doctors, missions, nonprofits, and other organizations could buy one pushing the market even higher by millions.

Simply put, this is an absolute cash cow in the making with the deal expected to close in Q1 of next year. All told the shitty end of my retard math estimates $1.275B in revenue on the low end and an even higher TAM. That doesn't even price in the retard strength when the WSB/robinhood hedge funds start getting involved and fucking around with it. LGVW closed at 17.39 with another 1% gain in aftermarket trading. Given the SPAC craze on the market, LGVW should have no problem heading towards the moon over the next few months.

Positions: Long LGVW with 263 shares, will buy more as capital becomes available.

**TL;DR Buy LGVW shares and calls. Bill Gates backs this company and he knows a thing or two about money. Their technology and capabilities are legit and its the ground floor of a fturistic med tech company. Buy before it becomes a meme. Godspeed fuckwads.**",2020-11-26 02:14:41

Think about it. A 40 year old trader in 2003. They would just dismiss these games as child's play. 

Now they have sons, who used to mock gaming types as nerds in class, in finance jobs sitting behind desks clueless towards the market. Have you seen American Psycho?

Meanwhile we're learning the ins and outs of the economy at an early age. And war.

The market for the bearrorists in a nutshell this week.,0.69,"I know  [bearrorist season ](http://imgur.com/a/JJ9RzS6)was open all year, besides that little break we gave them back in March-April (we do have to give them a little time off to reproduce after all, as much as we hate them, it would be sad to see them go instinct)

Anyway, we haven't seen them all week, since they're in deep hiding, triple guessing their life's choices rn.

Just wanted to remind everyone that possibly in a week or two, if PLTR actually see a very small red day, any speck of red, even 0.04%, we will see hundreds of threads an hour from all the bearrorists, screaming as loud as they can about ""HAHA FUCKING DUMBASSES BULLS, I TOLD YOU PLTR WOULD COME CRASHING?$@#& SOON, WHO'S FUCKED NOW BULLS HAHA WHERE IS YOUR PLTR NOW?"" just like when TSLA dipped a little bit a couple months ago (yea I know, hard to believe, but it was dipping for a day or two). That shit was so annoying, and this time won't be any different. 

When they come out to celebrate the only red day of the month, most of us will be busy on the phone ordering our new tesla, some their new pink lambo.

Again, I know it's gonna be very cringe to see all those fucking bearrorist posts, thinking they're hurting our feelings, while in the meantime we're only annoyed because we can't count our profits quickly enough because of all their constant shitposts.

So yea, just wanted to say in advance, fuck you you fucking bearrorist, you're not being edgy or funny, go back into hibernation.

"PLTR to $500/share - The Origin Story, Paypal Mafia",0.96,"For those of you who enjoyed my post on why the WSB is moving markets, see below. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0ctkd/why\_wsb\_is\_now\_running\_the\_entire\_equity\_market/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0ctkd/why_wsb_is_now_running_the_entire_equity_market/)

Now Let me tell you a story about Palantir and why it is so important. 

See, back in 1998, there were two internet payments company who were trying to make it big, one run by Peter Thiel and one run by Elon Musk. They eventually merged and created paypal. You can see the two of them here in the same picture. 

https://preview.redd.it/3ie03xvwgg161.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9368996a40228d96dae30a8d14c9a7b22d446a8

So why is paypal important. Well the Paypal mafia is known for building basically the entire post dot-com tech landscape that you know today. Yelp, youtube, square, linkedin, tesla/space X. And who is Peter Thiel, well, he is basically the smartest venture capitalist in the world and very well known in Silicon Valley. He was the first outside investor in facebook, he backed Tesla and SpaceX. 

So why does this matter? Well, Peter Thiel is one of the smartest men in the world. He was Chess grandmaster in his youth and he has a brilliant, contrarian mind. He foresaw the rise of SJW in the late 90s, this man either can predict the future or he is a time traveler. Either way, he is a savant. 

Now on to Palantir 

So why does this matter for Palantir. Peter founded Palantir in 2003. That was 17 years ago. What was his plan? Well, I think his plan is to create the next IBM. So hear me out. Well, historically the development of internet technology swung between enterprise and consumer. Prior to 2000, nobody in Silicon valley knew anything about consumer internet, everyone was busy chasing HP contracts or trying grab a DOD tender. But it swung to consumer for the next 20 years. He is making a calculating bet that consumer is played out and the next swing will be in the form of enteprise/government sales. 

And who was the big boss of enterprise/gov sales. Well it was IBM. See IBM wasn’t just the giant in computing that dominated from 1940-1980s, it started off selling office tools like punch cards and typewritters. They didn't have the best technology, but they had a big rolodex of government and corporate clients. When the computing revolution came around in the 1950s, it wasn't the best technology that won, but the one with the customer distribution. 

The same thing is happening with Palantir, they are doing manpower intensive work for governments and large corporates now, its not really a high margin scalable business (which is why wallstreet poo-hoos the stocks). But the thing is, they are positioned perfectly for the rise of AI. Much as the same way IBM was well positioned for the rise of computing. 

And that is why, PLTR will hit $500/share by 2030",2020-11-25 21:55:30

The inspiring tale of an Autist's redemption.",0.98,"On November 2nd I deposited $500 into my TDA account (my Robinhood account is restricted, a story for a different day).  I was pissed, tilted, and just frustrated at my shitty decision making.  I decided to take a real hard look at myself and my trading, and then after careful consideration I made the decision to double down on absolutely ridiculous FDs.  [Today I cashed out my positions at $27,000 (I withdrew $13,000 so my balance shows that deficit)](https://imgur.com/a/9nSuJoI). Below is a brief summary of the key moves that I made, please excuse the absolutely atrocious TDA UI display.

First I jumped in on an SQ earnings play ([$455 to $1,925](https://imgur.com/a/HjLFHy1)), then hopped on the PLTR train and grabbed some weeklies ([$1,825 to $6,363](https://imgur.com/a/VQQcEvj)).  I started feeling myself a little and decided to gamble on WMT earnings, which didn't go so well ([$5,569 to $495](https://imgur.com/a/goy1nTj)).  With the rest of my money I decided to switch it up and jump into some TSLA weeklies ([$3,200 to $10,600](https://imgur.com/a/p5yJ72B)).  After some questionable 0DTE plays where I lost 75% of my money I buckled down and jumped into PLTR 11/25 FDs, which was by far my most lucrative play ([$2286 to $27,350](https://imgur.com/a/xfEQLX9)).

In a rare moment of lucidity I cashed out all my positions and withdrew half of my balance (the other half I will be putting into 12/4 NIO calls on Friday).  So what's the point of this story?  A simple one really: if an idiot like me who makes atrocious plays (as evidenced by the above screenshots) can somehow come up with 5400% returns in less then a month, so can you!  All it takes is a gambling addiction, extreme luck, and an unbelievable pump of a meme stock to make it happen.",2020-11-25 20:07:21

PLTR Is The Most Undervalued Stock On The Market - $50 EOY,0.95,"I'm lost for words on how undervalued PLTR is, this might be the best stock play that we have had in a long time.

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/palantir-to-help-u-s-track-covid-19-vaccines-11603367276](https://www.wsj.com/articles/palantir-to-help-u-s-track-covid-19-vaccines-11603367276)

PLTR is one of the, if not, the only companies that are helping the government track Covid-19 data. They will also be tracking and handling the vaccine to make sure that everyone is able to get the vaccine. 

The distribution of the vaccine will also be heavily dependant on PLTR and how they handle everything.

The government will be spending boatloads of money on PLTR and now with Biden being in the Whitehouse, I wouldn't be surprised if they ramp up the amount of money going to PLTR since they are a key player in the Covid-19 situation.

Right now the many governments are coming to PLTR for help especially the U.S. government. The fat stacks of government cash should be coming in hot.

\- BlackRock Investment Management

\- Discovery Capital Management

\- Vanguard Index Fund

The financials of PLTR are something else, they are beautiful and are better than the financials of some of the top Fortune 100 and SP 500 companies.

\- $289.4M in revenue for Q3 alone not counting any of the other quarters.

\- Revenue is up 52% year over year.

\- Full-year revenue guidance raised to $1.072B

\- New Q3 contracts from the U.S. Army, National Institute of Health, Massive Aerospace Company

&#x200B;

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PLTR/key-statistics?p=PLTR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PLTR/key-statistics?p=PLTR)

Based on PLTRs financials, they are basically deebt-free at this point considering that they have $1.8B in CASH, fucking cash.

PLTRs gross PROFIT is amazing, they made $500M ttm in profit that they can use for R&D.

They have a market cap of 53.915B, must I say more?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

PLTR is $30 right now, considering all of this, it should be well over $100 or higher (I know I said $50 but that is for EOY)

Infinite PLTR cum.,0.79,"Infinite PLTR cum. 

You sit on the toilet to check your PLTR calls, but you begin to cum uncontrollably. After ten spurts you start to worry. Your hand is sticky and it reeks of semen. You desperately shove your dick into a wad of toilet paper, but that only makes your balls hurt. The PLTR calls keep printing, the cum accelerates. It’s been three minutes of green PLTR dildos. You can’t stop cumming. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of baby fluid. You try to cum into the shower drain but it builds up too fast. You try the toilet. The cum is too thick to be flushed. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cum from escaping. The air grows hot and humid from the cum. The PLTR calls keep printing, the cum accelerates. You slip and fall in your own sperm. The cum is now six inches deep, almost as long as your still-erect semen hose. Sprawled on your back, you begin to cum all over the ceiling. Globs of the sticky white fluid begin to fall like raindrops, giving you a facial with your own cum. The PLTR calls keep printing, the cum accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cum begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a bukkake themed slip-and-slide.  Still on your knees, the cum is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of man juice reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with cum instead of molasses. PLTR calls keep printing, the cum accelerates. It’s been two hours. Your children and wife scream in terror as their bodies are engulfed by the snow-white sludge. Your youngest child goes under, with viscous bubbles and muffled cries rising from the goop. You plead to God to end your suffering. PLTR calls keep printing, the cum accelerates. You squeeze your dick to stop the cum, but it begins to leak out of your asshole instead. You let go. The force of the cum tears your urethra open, leaving only a gaping hole in your crotch that spews semen.

Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the cum. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird’s eye view you see your house is completely white. Your neighbor calls the cops. PLTR calls keep printing, the cum accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray loads of cum hit them in the eyes, blinding them. PLTR calls keep printing, the cum accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. Hundreds of bullets pierce your body at once, yet you stay conscious. Your testicles have now grown into a substitute brain. PLTR calls keep printing, the cum accelerates. It has been two days. With your body now destroyed, the cum begins to spray in all directions. You break the sound barrier. The government deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cum sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the earth. You feel your gonads start to burn up as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new white paint job as you fly past. Physicists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. PLTR calls keep printing, the cum accelerates. The cum begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of semen. Astronomers begin calling you the “Cummet.” You are stuck in space forever, stripped of your body and senses, forced to endure an eternity of cumshots. Eventually, you stop thinking.

Why retards should consider JMIA with PLTR,0.63,"I have taken some numbers from reports available online, firstly  
In May 2019, Citron exposed the problems at Jumia Technologies (JMIA) that included: 

• Discrepancies in financials between investor presentations and SEC filings   
• Fraudulent orders   
• A company burdened with inefficiencies   


However, as Citron themselves have stated, now everything has changed. Starting an e-commerce business in an emerging market will have its challenges, the rewards can be great for patient investors as we’ve seen with MELI, BABA and SE. Over the past year, the pandemic has accelerated the global shift to e-commerce and JMIA has benefited from:   


• Acceleration of e-commerce adoption by Nigerian consumers   
• The renewed focus on profitability   
• The rapid acceptance of fintech products in Nigeria including JumiaPay   
• The ability to use JMIA has a platform for ancillary products    


There is no denying that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated e-commerce globally. JMIA is the key beneficiary as it is the only scaled e-commerce player in Africa. You can’t deny the numbers:   


• 1.3 billion population   
• 523 million internet users   
• Fastest growing continent in the world that will account for >50% of global population growth between now and 2050   
• McKinsey estimates that Africa e-commerce will grow to a $75 billion market opportunity by 2025   
• In Nigeria, over 40% of the population is under the age of 14 and over 50% of registered voters are under the age of 35   


As analysts have said, ""EITHER THESE YOUNG NIGERIANS WILL BE THE FIRST PEOPLE ON EARTH TO NOT ACCEPT E-COMMERCE OR THE STOCK IS GOING TO $100""  


JMIA Pay  
One of the largest criticisms of conducting e-commerce in Africa was the continent’s reliance on a cash economy, which is obviously not e-commerce friendly. JMIA has created their own digital currency – think PayPal, which now accounts for 24% of GMV and 36% of orders. Last month, McKinsey’s comments on the future of fintech can also be applied to e-commerce: “A youthful population, increasing smartphone penetration, and a focused regulatory drive to increase financial inclusion and cashless payments, are combining to create the perfect recipe for a thriving fintech sector.” The takeaway is no matter who wins in fintech, JMIA and e-commerce are winners.   


Forget about valuation and look more at significance. The country of Nigeria is dedicated to making e-commerce work to increase the quality of life of their growing and sizeable population. Consider this – JMIA is now shipping over 20 million packages a year to cities and rural areas across 11 countries. Nigeria is benefiting from the logistics network, technology and product offerings that JMIA has brought to this long overlooked part of the world. JMIA is at the epicenter of this movement and the only scaled e-commerce player in Africa.",2020-11-25 19:29:31

"Real Institutional DD for you losers, how to play this market",0.92," 

We all know SPY at ATHs, Dow 30k, PLTR is fucking moving, EV insanity blah blah blah. But I just know there is some bleary eyed idiot from Stocks and Investing here that is like I just CANT bring myself to take these kind of risks, look how expensive the market is!!!

Even though the market is at all time highs, and basically the market has been trading flat other than yesterday, there is crazy volatility underneath the surface. For almost a decade, growth stocks (high top line growth, high multiples, etc) have outperformed value because 1) growth was hard to find as the economy was dog shit 2) interest rates dropped like a stone from 4 down to 1.4% pre-covid which makes cash flows in the out year more valuable today when you discount them back 3) usually high period of disruption due to technology (connectivity, shift to mobile, computing increases, etc). **But basically, when growth is hard to find, you are willing to pay the fuck up for future earnings growth.**

But boys. Let me tell ya, economic growth is coming the fuck back. One, the Fed goes fucking brrr - and ole Yellen is back in the saddle.1) The Fed is basically a permeant backstop now which basically changes the equation of risk for both investors and companies. 2) The Dems will, and should, print money with reckless abandon. Because the US dollar is the global reserve currency they should print dough until the dollar fucking breaks. And it basically hasn't budged even though the US has spent 7 trilly on Stimulus. 3) Savings rates in both the US and Canada are at all time highs, with interest rates at all time lows. Have you seen the fucking housing market? Not only is there lots of money on the sidelines, **demand is coming online in sync across the globe.** You may never see a demand spike like you are about to see in areas like Leisure / Travel. Hotels in Honolulu aren't going from 150$/night back to $400 next year. Mother fucker they are going to 600. Every live sporting event, concert, festival, restaurant will be fucking PACKED. **4)** The fed changed their inflation policy from 2%, to an average metric - basically meaning they will run the economy hot to bring average inflation up to 2-2.5% over an observed time period. Well inflation has been sub 1.5% for YEARS and they will run this fucker HOT at 5-6% GDP before they touch rates. **Most important thing here is that rates are going up on the ten year, there will be unreal demand for things most affected by the virus, and the relative valuation of low pe stocks is going to start looking reallll good realll fast.**

So what does this mean? You want to be in early cycle cyclicals right now. Industrials, Materials, Banks. You also wanna be in travel/restaurants. Energy will rock too, but its kind of dog shit and you can leave it be.

Curve ball though - I'm one of those blind ass tech bulls. I'm not here to tell you that GM is better than TSLA, they aren't. But when you can pay 15x for 100% EPS growth from GM you're going to do that instead of paying 300x for the same rate at Tesla. Same thing with software. I jerk off that business model and the trap door isn't going to fall out, its just not going to do fucking well on a relative basis.

I don't wanna sell my tech shit, but I wanna participate in this reopening lunacy. So how do I do it? Buy shit thats going to do well if some government shut the place down. I'm talking DOCU, PTON, ZM, COUP, OKTA, I dunno, whatever software you want. But balance this shit with long dated calls in reopening stuff. If your calls expiry worthless, your tech shit will be up so much you won't care. If tech is flat to down you'll mint on the calls. I control 16x in shares vs my outlay for the calls, basically the size of the rest of my portfolio in Reopening calls June 21-Jan 22. Sharpe ratio (return/vol) for the last two months is 5.2. Psychologically, the lockdown headlines just aren't doing it anymore. LA, NYC, Chicago, France, Germany, Canada, all locked down, market it looking through it. AZN puts out a garbage vaccine release and value is smoking hot. You'll see more catalysts as these places reopen, first innoculations are announced, general availability, etc. AND cases will start to seasonally decline around March when it gets warmer out. And if you don't think this shit is seasonal, you're dumb. You think we just found the magic in July? Shut up.

APXT: Merging with AvePoint,0.97,"APXT has reached a deal to merge with AvePoint, the largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider. The company is being valued at $2 billion and will trade under AVPT.

APXT has a huge client base already, at an estimated 7 million members. 25% of the Fortune 500 uses Avepoint.

'AvePoint’s 7 million customers represent a 3% share of Microsoft’s 250 million 365 users. AvePoint believes it can get to 10% share and Microsoft will hit 500 million users in the future, good for 50 million AvePoint future customers.'

Addressable market: $33 billion by 2022.

The company ALREADY HAS REVENUE (unlike other SPACs), which is expected to total $148 million by the end of this year. A large % of this is recurring revenue as well, with 78% of revenues in 2020 estimated to be recurring. Expected revenue CAGR of 30% to 2022.

**5-time winner of Microsoft Partner of the Year award.**

Management: 'Apex is led by former Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig'. These are huge, knowledgeable players. They can turn this company into a goliath, especially with the extra capital from a SPAC.

Big name backers: Sixth Street Partners, Goldman Sachs,

Big advisors on the deal, including Goldman Sachs, Evercore and Citigroup.

This seems similar to the other data related plays weve had this year \*cough\* PLTR \*cough\*. Not the same type, but definitely in a growth market with strong margins. Also allows you to diversify away from EVs a bit.

The SPAC hasn't run yet, currently trading at $10.75 per share, so this has a lot of room to run. Very little downside, but huge potential upside.

PLTR STILL UNDERVALUED - PRICE TARGET - $50 EOY,0.96,"PLTR is undervalued by about x2 minimum. Analysis:

Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data-warehousing company that was founded in 2012. 

Market Cap:  81.40B 

PLTR - Palantir Technologies is a public American software company that specializes in big data analytics. Founded in 2003 

Market cap - 44.13B

Both companies use data analytics for clients to analyse large data sets. Snowflake offers a platform. PLTR offers a specialised solution to each client. Different business models. Same solution.

The numbers:

PLTR - Quarterly revenue: Est:  289.37M

SNOW -  Quarterly revenue: Est: 33.14M

Cash on hand :

PLTR -  1.8B  
SNOW -  138.9M  
   
PLTR  3x Revenue of SNOW, Better product tailored to clients needs, involved in both public and private sector,  stronger financials. IMO better company, but has went under the radar from money managers until ARKK and Cathie Woods made a move this week - Big money is now analysing this stock and will be moves this weekend.

The reason PLTR is mooning isn't because of speculation it's because the stock is still grossly undervalued.

* Asana helps companies stay on track with project management tools.
* Asana can help companies both large and small.
* Asana was a direct listing (they don't need cash).
* Customer retention for long time periods is really high.

Asana is currently getting past their IPO-woes, and the stock is well-positioned to shoot up over the next few months with positive earnings and outlook.

Asana has some competition, but they suck. Also, Asana's marketcap is low enough where a buyout by Microsoft or Salesforce is reasonable in the next 2 years.

PLTR GETS CONTRACT WITH MARS,0.64,,2020-11-25 17:34:34
Here's a post that's not about PLTR - CRDF up 3x this month. Jump in before we get to 10x,0.67,"I don't know when I bought these shares, but I had this random ticker in my account for the past year or so, doing nothing, then all of a sudden, it started going up. So I bought some calls too. And somehow, it actually kept going up!

CRDF 2/19 12.5

After that I decided I should look up the company and see what tf it actually is. Cardiff Oncology. WHOA!! it's gonna cure cancer or something. That's awesome. Maybe even better than a battery powered car or spying software or whatever that Palantir makes (and no knock on PLTR, I'm balls deep)

Buy now. LEAPS? sure. Stocks? Boring, but yes. Short term calls? The premium isn't great, but these could print too.",2020-11-25 17:34:00
"The boring way to make (almost) guaranteed money (LONG AS FUCK, you've been warned)",0.95,"I know that this is a casino/circus/Wendy's, but hear me out.  Anyone who can't read or gets exhausted easily: you'll probably want to stop here.

There was a [post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0ctkd/why_wsb_is_now_running_the_entire_equity_market/) that really put into words what I've been trying to explain to people who don't understand why the market keeps going up despite all reason and logic, and this ties into a process I've been using (pretty successfully) to make realized money (the kind you can spend on things) instead of potential money (which is great for karma, but not much else).

Instead of doing all the DD and research and market analysis, I have adopted what I am calling the surfing model (this may already be a thing but I don't have a finance degree): buy-in (on anything -- no DD) when the MACD-value crosses above the MACD-avg, and RSI is sub-70.  On acquisition, immediately set a trailing-stop @ -XX%.  That's it.  I don't care what the company is, I don't care what it does; I don't need to.  I am only buying to sell for a profit and the MACD trigger is a good indicator that value is about to increase.

Here's one of our favorite meme stocks (SPCE) in action:

[MACD-value \(middle, blue\), MACD-avg \(middle, yellow\), RSI \(bottom\)](https://preview.redd.it/2c2ef82c2f161.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=be0f0612b69c33b071ced1b35524133ca6a4cbcf)

&#x200B;

So why do we use a trailing-stop instead of just selling when the MACD reverses itself?  Because MACD is less granular than the actual value of an asset and may stay steady even with a significant dip in price.  For example, PLTR saw a +10% retraction leading up to earnings, at which point you would have sold your shares (like I did), and then be able to re-buy them (at a profit) $1.86 lower:

[PLTR went from $15 something to $13 something day of ER; if you'd sold and then listened to Warren Buffet you'd have regained all your initial shares plus earned tendies @ \~$1.80\/share.](https://preview.redd.it/n2y18sd43f161.png?width=459&format=png&auto=webp&s=f11879ff59c07f1796aeafc29ab7f20418b80795)

&#x200B;

Of course, this model does have limitations.  This is the surfing model because when you surf, you have to catch the wave at the right point, or you miss is completely.  This means no buying into existing trends, no chasing shit that's already taken off, and no FOMO (which can be a good thing -- if you always wonder why when you buy something it immediately crashes, this is for you).

This also means you could have to wait for a long time to jump into something or miss out out on potential profits, as demonstrated by NIO:

[NIO's wave started back in October \~$24; you'd miss out on 100&#37;+ returns with this model.  Most underlying positions do not have these legs and this model is more focused on delivering consistent returns and less so with potential missed opportunity.](https://preview.redd.it/6ef57jb45f161.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d9ebcec4463705fb80c5e10261f2ec8904e98c2)

&#x200B;

So we've used all clown stocks up to this point; what about boomer stocks and options?  Same thing:

[Even F plays by the rules; remember this is buying on market momentum and let other retards spend all their time doing DD and analysis -- all the lights turn green?  BUY!](https://preview.redd.it/sfwl67pn6f161.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=362b7f282178a5c84282be56f7c0acf3144d50db)

&#x200B;

The trailing-stop set @ -XX% is the market's way of telling you you've probably gotten the best of the wave and it's time to catch a new one (or buy the dip and get tendies as demonstrated in the PLTR example above).  Sure, it may continue on but more than likely you have more opportunities elsewhere (remember stocks/options/companies are cattle, not pets -- use them to make money and move on.  If you're *<insert-meme-stock-here>-gang* you're doing it wrong).

For quick in/out I roll with -5%.  Positions I think have longer term value despite fluctuations I'll set -10% but I NEVER (don't have anything I think is worth that amount of loss) go more than -20%; that's like market/underlying collapse territory and you want to peace the fuck out if that triggers and then buy the bottom.

In addition to protecting profits, this also protects you from gross losses.  PING went all green last week so I jumped in.  It then proceeded to go red dildo and triggered my -5% trailing-stop below what I bought it for.  Instead of getting wiped out, I lost 5% and moved onto something else.  Small losses are manageable and will reduce your tax liabilities.  Huge losses take you out of the game.

Well, if you've made it this far; congrats and good luck.  If you have a system that works awesome for you by all means keep using it.  If you're getting bounced around and can't keep track of what the latest meme stock is or what we're transitioning into/out of, go back through any underlying and see if this model makes you money (yay back-testing!)

EDIT:

Hey look; real-world example!  WORK just spiked b/c of buy-out news and then dropped; trailing-stop adjusted for the spike and then got me out @ $37.20/share, which I could now re-buy @ $36-something for +$1 profit/share:

[Salesforce announced potential buy-out offer of Slack \(WORK\) while I was screwing around on reddit; auto-sell locked-in my gains](https://preview.redd.it/6aui8v44hf161.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a99365e38b35d0e9ebc9e903ca7dc2270a9cc8f)

Here's the 43% gains I made in a week (100 shares is my norm) using this model:

[I'll take 43&#37; profit any day.  Do they all do this well?  No, but the vast majority earn double-digit returns and have minimal downside risk due to the trailing-stop firewall](https://preview.redd.it/9yk9v3fqsf161.png?width=1315&format=png&auto=webp&s=497248d608fe95ae7305e41f097036437dcfbe95)

EDIT 2 & 3:

Running this with ZM presently; changed my trailing-stop to -3% after I cleared my initial -5% threshold (-5% is worth more than what I paid for it).  This will give me less wiggle room to manage bounces but will also protect more profit once it comes back down, presumably after ER next week.

[ZM crapped-out well before ER.  Missed out on some additional gains during the day but it bottomed-out further AH post-ER so I still did ok: $3,500 in 2.5 days of trading \(9.2&#37;\).  Changed trailing-stop to -4&#37; to account for whole market dropping.](https://preview.redd.it/fb4b1y3i0h261.png?width=1312&format=png&auto=webp&s=02922a1ae326be01b138984204ef8ff611938194)",2020-11-25 17:33:39

The low down on the next PLTR type success story.,0.67,"Say it with me. 5G. A number and a letter have never meant so much to the computing industry as those two. 5G has been tagged as the next revolution in phones, and while that's true, it's in computing that the real money and change will happen.  

The IoT, internet of things, market by 2030 will be over 6 trillion dollars. From self driving smart cars to self-ordering refrigerators. Many if not most of these appliances will use 5G connections. Even more so the health and security industry. With the practically non-existent latency issues surgery from Doctors in first world nations can be done halfway around the world through a 5G connection on someone in the middle of poor countries. 

There are three names that stand out in the IoT space (and 5g overall). Nokia, Ericson and Huawei. 

I don't think I have to go much into the issues with Huawei being adapted in America or Europe due to the amount of data such a company could attain with a huge market share of 5G connections. China is not gonna be allowed into this market without some serious change to their nation I don't see that happening soon. 

That leave Nokia and Ericsson. 

Whole it seems Ericson may have the leg up. That's not the case when one takes a deeper look. 

Nokia has a p/e ratio of under 13 compared to the industry standard of 30. Ericson is at 27. 

Nokia has crossed the hundred contract threshold earlier this year including huge contracts in England and many other nations if BT mobile and Verizon in Europe. 

Nokia has also been tapped by NASA to install 4g by 2024 on the moon and 5g by 2030. This should just be the start of a fruitful relationship between the US government and Nokia. Congress is currently working on an open RAN 5g secure network and the largest producer of open RAN 5G, and it's not even close, is Nokia. 

Nokia has been on some hard times. They are a cry from their heyday in the early 2000s. But they are a 90+ year old company with the backing of a large and rich nation, Finland. They have brought back the CEO who made them a 60$ stock and a household name till today, in Peka Lundmark. 

Nokias stock got beaten down just now in latest earnings. But that was just an over reaction. 

The company ultimately showed strong cost cutting with constant cash flow growth. They are leaders in an emerging trillion dollar industry. They have lost trust and rightly so, but I believe it will be earned back. 

I am heavily invested in long shares and leaps options. I have a delta over 10k and I keep adding. I truly believe this will be a 40+ dollar stock by 2023. The time to start accumulating is now.",2020-11-25 15:35:30

Tips on exiting positions that are capping your gains (covered calls/spreads),1.0,"So I've been finding my self getting bent over lately by trying to play it a tad safe, and or expecting reasonable growth, not chia pet growth.

&#x200B;

PLTR, entered at 15.5ish on the dip on the 20th, sold a covered call for 20 by the 27th... Well damn... wasnt expecting this much of a rise, and while I rolled with a credit to 25 I had to push it out to like Feb.... then 25 comes knocking... well fuck, lets roll again... Now I'm stuck with a $30 strike for May.

&#x200B;

My problem is I dont want to just be watching the rocket take off and having my profits capped way back down a few hundred feet above ground... but I also dont want to be trapped in the position for so long.

&#x200B;

Currently, if I bought out my covered calls to be open shares that raises my effective buy in price to $21, erasing over half my gains.

&#x200B;

I had the same issue with SOLO, AYRO, and a few other of the MoonMemes... Are there any other ways to exit these negative positions and hop on the rocket without killing my profits?  


Current max is \~1500/contract in May. If I bought back my calls, PLTR would have to hit 36 before I made the same, but I'd be free.",2020-11-25 15:09:25

Grow Generation is the nation's largest chain of specialty hydroponic and organic garden centers. They already operate in 11 states, and intend on expanding to at least 15 by EOY.

How? By fucking **gobbling** up the competition. They’ve already acquired 14 hydroponic companies. Last week, they inhaled GrowBiz, the nation's third-largest chain of hydroponic garden centers.

Does Palantir ($PLTR) have a scaling issue going forward?,0.73,"&#x200B;

I got in at 10 and 15. Way before the hype started and just after Cathie Wood. I really believe this is a great company with a solid product. However as a developer myself there is things I do see as a problem.

Palantir is an analytic infrastructure to companies, they are invaluable to companies that hold a big amount of data but has no plan or way to actually structure that data. I believe once you start using Palantirs products it's very hard to quit. 

&#x200B;

**The product**

In order for Palantir to sell their product they literally have to get their FDE ([https://www.palantir.com/careers/teams/forward-deployed-software-engineers](https://www.palantir.com/careers/teams/forward-deployed-software-engineers)) onsight. 

A lot of people have no idea what the hell Palantir does. They don't have a massive database where you just can pick out data from and spy on people. What they do is extract the companies data from different sources, structured and unstructured. Clean it and run it through various ML models in order to make sense of it. What they are actually are doing is building these huge interconnected pipelines between all the datapoints, things that had no connection before suddenly do. This is MASSIVE for companies, they can ask the right questions now. The have the answers infront of them, they just have to ask for it.

**The issue**

My whole problem with Palantir is that they are heavily dependent on this process, they can't just sell a product and one the same day have it working. They actually have to process the data for a few weeks before they have a working product, this is basically consulting. It's not scalable, it's customizable. They need units on the ground all the time for new contracts. 

&#x200B;

Now from my understanding it's actually improving, they are quicker and quicker with integrating new customers but I just can't see how they will scale as fast as people think they will. I don't think they can grow at an amazing pace.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR** 

Amazing analytics software that makes the companies see connections between data that not been possible before, however issues with how many new customers they actually can earn going forward.",2020-11-25 14:06:14

Has Wallstreetbets become the most influential internet gathering(incl. the most influential subreddit) in the world?,0.95,"The flow of capital determines numerous functions and entities of our life. Everything from the next great innovative startup to the most boring business being conducted.

Wallstreetbets seems to have become strong enough with the power of market makers, algo traders, hedge funds, margins, options traders and passive investment bubble to be in a position to influence the flow of capital to it’s preferred stocks.

This would inevitably lead to companies and innovators wanting to exploit this glitch and generate wealth in the process.

Right now, as it is, wallstreetbets seems to be the most influential internet gathering in the world with billions of capital flowing towards the direction the subreddit determines worthy.

If this trend continues, we would be looking at an investment bubble that gets created only at certain parts of our economy, active fund managers will also try to chase the wallstreetbets crowd and price discovery would become impossible.

There could be significant arbitrage opportunities in the comparatively reasonably priced securities, but if the market has no demand for it, then this whole opportunity becomes useless(T anyone?).

Of course the FEDs decision to pump borrowers and dump savers; keeping interest rate low to create liquidity in the main street using QE which has proved itself to be grossly ineffective and a mere certificate to keep zombie companies afloat etc are the main drivers behind us degenerates flocking to the stock market.

Small businesses being completely wrecked, laid off workers, extremely high housing price; there seems to be no other alternative for us other than to play the game and sing along the song.

All those things have created the monstrous giant that is wallstreetbets today. It’s influence is being felt by the market insiders and they are feeling jealous.

Every day, news after news is coming out that some stock is popping for no reason. ""Excuse me, sir, have you looked at the underlying reason"", I would say.

Wallstreetbets has no doubt created a bubble in some stocks in the market. But that doesn’t stop us. If you 100% your money and the stock then decreases 20%, you are still up 60%.

Palantir Technologies inc PLTR: A fraud since 2003?,0.2,"Palantir has not made a profit since 2003. It is a software company that offers a product called ''Gotham"" for the defense and intelligence sector, another product called ''Foundry'' sold to the private sector. Both products run on a SaaS infrastructure called Apollo and use Amazon's web services (AWS) as their PaaS.

In 2015, during a promotion tour for his book ""Zero to One"", Peter Thiel, the founder of Palantir explains to the audience that one should be wary of ""buzz words"": 

''All trends are overrated, if we think about the current trend in technology... Healthcare IT software: overrated, SaaS enterprise software: really overrated, Big data cloud computing... if you hear these words you have to think FRAUD. You have to run away as fast as possible... These buzz words are like a poker game that says that people are bluffing... that the company is not undifferentiated because it is part of a category and therefore symptomatic of strong competition and a bad business idea"".

So before you buy the stock, just remember that it is just an other Analytics and Business Intelligence software company but with a lot of buzz words and secrecy.

But who cares? YOLO the momentum and buy buy buy !! (sarcasm)

PLTR overperforming = 🚀,0.96,"**When a stock, with reason to overperform, overperforms, it doesn't mean it's due for correction. It's due for liftoff.**

PLTR is overperforming, according to my TA standards. I considered CRSR and NIO to have both been overperforming when they were trading around $30, respectively, and look at them now. Both in the $50 territory. During this time, moreso expecting a correction, I wanted one. I knew that these companies would grow but it didn't matter. I wanted to get in for a few dollars cheaper. PLTR is not trading at $30 yet, but it doesn't change the fact that they will liftoff. 

CRSR sells computer accessories and peripherals in a time where everyone is building their own PC.

NIO sells electric vehicles in China, where they are actively trying to reduce carbon emissions.

PLTR sells secure, scalable, user-friendly data infrastructure in a time where companies have more data than they know what to do with. 

And they have yet to enter the realm of electric vehicles, but they are more than ready: [https://www.palantir.com/solutions/automotive/](https://www.palantir.com/solutions/automotive/)

Considerations: Lock-up period and George Soros sell-off. 

Terms of the lock-up in their most recent amended IPO Investment Prospectus found here: [https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-250103/](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-250103/)

tl;dr Lock-up ends three trading days after PLTR discloses Q4 2020 earnings. It's estimated PLTR reports Q4 earnings on [Thursday Feb 11, 2021](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/PLTR/earnings/).

I believe that these two are tied together considering that Soros stated his plans, through his foundation, to sell more PLTR shares as they are allowed.

>When Palantir converted to a public company, SFM’s interest was converted into shares in the public company. SFM has sold all shares in the company that it is not legally or contractually obliged to hold and will continue to sell shares as permitted. SFM does not approve of Palantir’s business practices. SFM made this investment at a time when the negative social consequences of big data were less understood. SFM would not make an investment in Palantir today. 

However, Soros is wrong in his understanding of what Palantir does. They provide infrastructure to organize data. Palantir's core principle is privacy by design. You should be assured that they would not work with companies that would use data in the traditional sense of ""big data"" where your data is harvested and sold to advertisers. [https://www.palantir.com/pcl/](https://www.palantir.com/pcl/)

>Palantir was founded on the conviction that it's essential to preserve fundamental principles of privacy and civil liberties while using data.   
>  
>. . .  
>  
>From their first day, new Palantirians are trained to ask: ""Do I want to live in the kind of world that the technology we're building would enable?"" 

Gray area would be [PLTRs effort in combating Covid-19](https://www.palantir.com/covid19/). However it's not really a gray area considering the fact that using patient (not personal) data for analysis is a standard practice in the health industry and serves to improve healthcare and inform the public about the statistics. E.g., Tracking Covid-19 cases would reveal number of cases but not the names of patients.

&#x200B;

In addition, Palantir has a history of philanthropy.

* Palantir has partnered with NMEC for over 7 years to help identify and rescue child victims and prevent future victimization for thousands of child exploitation cases in the United States.
* Palantir works with Team Rubicon. Team Rubicon provides relief efforts after natural disasters.
* Palantir helps to fight world hunger with the World Food Programme, which happens to be the food assistance branch of the United Nations.

Big-data mining company Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) has an element of mystery or secrecy surrounding it. Perhaps that’s because Palantir has had clients like the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Department of Defense. 
And so, there’s something exciting about owning PLTR stock.
From what we know about Palantir, serving government agencies has been a highly lucrative niche. For instance, Palantir reportedly netted a contract earlier this year to provide software to the Department of Defense. Evidently, that contract was worth as much as $823 million.

PLUG POWER RAISES APPROXIMATELY $1B TO ACCELERATE THE FIRST NATION-WIDE GREEN HYDROGEN NETWORK
11/24/20
Download this Press ReleasePDF Format (opens in new window)
LATHAM, N.Y., Nov. 24, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ: PLUG), a leading provider of hydrogen engines and fueling solutions enabling e-mobility, has successfully completed one of the largest bought equity deal transactions in the broader clean-tech sector. This marks Plug Power’s largest capital raise in the Company’s history with approximately $1 billion of capital, bringing total cash post-closing balance to $1.7 billion. The capital raise uniquely positions Plug Power to execute and accelerate on its green hydrogen strategy as well as other strategic growth initiatives.
Plug Power recently announced its plans to build five regional green hydrogen facilities in the United States. The Company will continue to work with strategic partners, including Apex Clean Energy and Brookfield Renewable, to source low-cost renewable power. The combination of low-cost renewables, strong capital position, and in house electrolyzer and liquefaction technology all uniquely position Plug Power to build out this green hydrogen network. Furthermore, Plug Power has already become the largest user of liquid hydrogen with its internal demand increasing from current 40TPD (tons per day), to 100TPD by 2024.The first two green hydrogen plants are expected to be operational in 2022. All five plants are expected to be operational by 2024, with a total capacity of 100TPD. This would constitute the country's first nationwide green hydrogen network. The green hydrogen generated by this network will support the mission to decarbonize the broader transportation and logistics industries, a mission shared by both Plug Power and its customers. The Company's unmatched industry position as a total solutions provider will also help facilitate the anticipated rapid growth of the hydrogen economy. According to consultancy McKinsey & Company, the global hydrogen economy could reach $2.5 trillion by 2050, representing 18% of the global energy demand.“We are very pleased with the reception from the institutional investors and the market resulting in a meaningfully upsized capital raise. This ideally positions Plug Power to accelerate the growth of the green hydrogen economy in the United States and globally, a job we wholeheartedly accept,” said Andy Marsh, CEO of Plug Power. “Green hydrogen provides one of the lowest carbon emission solutions from a wells-to-wheels perspective serving a variety of different industries.”“We have identified several locations working with strategic partners where we can produce green hydrogen at parity with grey hydrogen and see further opportunities to reduce the cost of green hydrogen. Furthermore, this recently completed capital raise and in house capabilities ideally positions us to accelerate the build out of this green hydrogen network,” said Sanjay Shrestha, Chief Strategy Officer and head of Plug Power’s green hydrogen generation business.

How do I unfuck my PLTR shares,0.76,"Firstly - I'm a fucking retard.

Last week I sold x6 11/27 23c covered calls for $0.30 each. Today's run brought the net liquidity on those to ($873).

Today, I rolled those up and out to 12/4 26c for a net $0 premium.  I'm up $243 on these as of market close.

Now I am regretting ever doing covered calls on my shares.

Questions:

(1) If I am able to roll these CCs up and out to 1/15 40c for a credit or $0 premium, would I have retained the original $180 premium from the first calls I sold? Can I not roll these indefinitely to avoid execution?

(2)  Am I missing something with the approach described in (1)?


Thanks for any help,

"Palantir isn't just tech, they are breaking into consulting",0.93,"You probably don't care who I am, but it is relevant to mention I am student at Columbia working with previous employees at Palantir, McKinsey, and a few IB firms to conduct some bullshit market research. After PLTR's IPO, I decided to bug them with some questions. TLDR at the bottom.

The biggest confusion is that Palantir is not in the data collection industry. They make tools to analyze data and contract out consultants (Forward Deployed Engineers) to do the analysis -- but the data is not being sourced by them. There's nothing you can do with Palantir that you couldn't do with any consulting firm or an in-house data-science/data-engineering team. Palantir's value proposition is that they have better tools and smarter people than those at BCG, Accenture, Bain, McKinsey, etc.

Palantir does a couple of tech demos aimed at engineers, and they consistently focus on two big things. The first is experience and scale: Palantir has probably dealt with a problem a lot like yours in the past, and has the pre-existing tooling and expertise to produce results much faster than even an equally-competent internal team could. The second is selling human-integrated products, where instead of handing over a data lake or an ML pipeline spitting out probabilities, they provide analysis environments that let human analysts manage lots of data in easily-understood ways, and highlight further data they might wish to integrate.  Really just creating interfaces for boomers. This is extremely similar to to how McKinsey deploys teams of engineers when they consult, minus the fact that older consulting firms don't have Stanford engineers.

When people wanted to restrict the National Tracing Center, they restricted it to analog data so that people can only be identified via targeted lookup. Palantir sells the opposite of that; maybe you can't get somebody's phone location without a warrant, but if you can aggregate license plate scanners, automated tolling records, and credit card transactions into a unified model of where they went, maybe you don't need to. Palantir has a huge leg up over other consulting companies attempting to do the same work.

What differentiates Palantir from virtually every other data analytics software provider is that it combines its software with consulting services into a single information product that it licenses to its clients. Palantir’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicate that the average value of its contracts was \~$5.5M in 2019, which highlights the HUGE revenue potential of the company’s ""hybrid"" approach. 

tl;dr: Palantir is covering way more ground than people think and will take over tech consulting at the rate they are growing at. If you don't believe me, buy calls anyways.

LUMN is the next PLTR believe it or weep,0.84,"Enterprise was 28% of Lumen's Q3 revenue. Next quarter, I predict this will grow by 10-20%. Why? DD below:  
- Hiring like crazy for enterprise division. Watch a video from the head of HR here: https://jobs.lumen.com/global/en   
- ""We are furthering human progress through technology. Our amazing people are helping our companies do amazing things."" What's not amazing about that?   
- But seriously, they have over 110 positions open in technology and 20 in project management   
- 142 Sales and Marketing jobs  
- Only 41 other non tech jobs  
- So basically, tech and selling the tech. They are not slow stepping here and that's what I think Michael Burry saw.   
- Check out their new site at www.lumen.com which is already getting 210,000 visitors a month (up from 2000 visitors on launch in august or 10,000% growth)
- As our government and tech overlords continue to expand, the non tech companies will need a savior and that savior is Lumen. The same way PLTR is sucking up all the surveillance business, LUMN will suck up all the transformation business for big enterprises.   
- Look at their featured customers: Salesforce, Zoom  
- Now for some financials:  diluted EPS was $0.34 vs. $0.28 in 2019 and management says they are committed and focused on EPS with a three year goal of saving $800-$1b a year  
- Next quarter they are going to way outperform in both actual numbers and sentiment because they will start to show growth rather than decline    
- And Michael Burry's 800,000 are going to triple in value.

My question is, would people be interested in a sub WSBs where you had to confirm to the moderators you had at least 25k in your account in order to join? This could be any number, 50 even, but that’s the daytrade minimum so I went with that. I miss loss porn that has 5 zeroes in it and that’s the kind of content that would be available there, and I also have a feeling the DD wouldn’t just be glorified pump and dump or bubble feeding.

Gentlemen Start your Jet Engines (RR.L),0.78,"**RR.L is on the move, more to the point it's taking off!**

If you don't want all your money on PLTR calls (though I do get why you would) consider Rolls Royce. Not the car company, the engine manufacturer. 

**The Good.**

The current share price has been depressed by a new issuance of shares and is still rock bottom after COVID-19. It has tumbled from \~700GBX ($9.10 USD aprox.) to \~120GBX as of now. The stock was hilariously oversold s boomers jumped ship, while its stock lost over 80% of its value its actual revenue dropped 23% (H1 2020).

It's not just a widebody jet engine manufacturer, it granted is still about 45% of overall revenue. It's defence arm actually grew their profit 19% YoY (H1 2020). Another key point is that most of its engines are already out in the wild and aftermarket sales and service is a significant generator of revenue over the service life of all their products. Therefore, it's not their new engines that are likely to be taken out of service if the airline industry struggles or even fails to fully recover.

As a further point to that rolls Royce is one of the few countries in the world with the skills and experience to design and build small scale nuclear reactors. Whether that's impotnat to you or not, Nuclear power may yet gain a place in the drive for cleaner energy.

It’s a household name, the company does have a lot of brand recognition and public goodwill and is still developing new products.

**The Bad**

*It is not optionable.*

The company is currently laden with debt, and overall, the company is in negative equity. To the tune of £3.3B (Full year 2019) this is most definitely NOT a potential value investment. They also do not have an efficient manufacturing process, estimating their current headcount to be 33% above what they expect they will need in the coming years. 

There is a high level of uncertainty in the commercial aviation market, at least with passenger aviation, and Rolls Royce have based many their forward-looking statements on a 90% recovery by 2022. If that is not the case the company could struggle, or even collapse.

The company has reduced the deficit on its pension find, closed to new employees since 2007, but it is still large, at £1.38B (FY 2019).

It’s nice to see you guys giving each other PS5s and shit, but we should also give back to charity, especially this year. Covid is taking all the attention, meaning other charities are probably getting less than what they normally get.

We should get some of our wins to Red Cross or any cause we feel related to. Donate to WWF, or in a few generations “bears” will only exist on the stock market. Hell, donate to Wikipedia for helping some of you get through college.

DKNG- this stock has suffered immensely from covid, dropping to the high 30's from the mid 60’s. The story for draft kings hasn't changed. Huge growth potential with a total addressable market of more than 35B+. I believe Draft kings is better positioned than PENN due to their unique product, their digital presnce and their ability to scale into other markets quickly. DKNG has no debt and grew 40%+ even with most sports shut down. This could easily be a 75$+ stock. currently the consensus target is 61 with the high target of $ 100 and the low of $39.00.

Palantir Valuation - Opening the Black Box,0.97,"I asked you guys what company you wanted me to do a valuation on and PLTR was the favorite. This admittedly took me longer than I thought it would because this company is so weird and shady and honestly, next to impossible to predict. I try anyway. Feel free to jump around the text, I **bolded** main themes so they are easier to find.

&#x200B;

* Palantir Technologies was founded in 2003 and the company offers  a unique and powerful operating system (OS) to government and  commercial clients
* PLTR has found its stride in providing  solutions to the US government, particularly in aiding intelligence,  counter-terrorism, and military
* PLTR provides anti-money laundering and flight operations solutions to commercial clients
* With  \~131 customers today on lumpy deals and limited visibility into future  opportunities, let alone conversion rates, PLTR seems a company with a  binary outcome to us. Will they or won’t they bring more customers on to  the platform? A single customer add changes the company’s outlook, and  as a result, valuation, significantly

**Company Background and Summary:** Palantir’s data /  analytics platform is differentiated with its “full stack” approach. For  businesses providing a product or service, **a full stack approach means addressing the complete value chain from end-to-end,**  controlling the entire customer experience instead of providing a  partial solution that relies on licensing to, or integrating with,  existing businesses serving the target market. Palantir technology is a  one-stop shop, for now, but they have shown signs of flexibility which  will be key in its growth as a company.

PLTR’s two core platforms include **Gotham** and **Foundry**.

**Gotham:** Palantir’s first platform, Gotham was built  for government operatives in defense and intelligence. Gotham enables  end user to identify patterns within large datasets and enables users to  create and execute responses.

**Foundry:** This platform enables organizations to  create a central OS for their data. Users can integrate with other core  systems and analyze large datasets in a singular, consolidated platform.  Foundry is primarily targeted to commercial customers.

Despite having a low number of customers, once PLTR penetrates the  customer and becomes a core data platform, thanks to this full-stack  approach they are able to expand rapidly. Average revenue per customer  (ARPC) has been growing at a 30% CAGR since 2009, reaching $5.8mm as of  2019. The top 20 customers have a spend even greater at $23.6mm. This  sort of revenue per customer growth is indicative of PLTR’s ability to  prove and expand into new use cases once a customer is onboard. The PLTR  platform addresses a variety of workflows including data management,  integration, app development, security, analytics, supply chain,  enterprise resource planning (ERP,) and the mythical \~AI\~ among others.

The revenue growth is impressive, with Q3 growth at 52% y/y and full  year 2020 revenue expected to be 44% year-over-year. However, is this  revenue growth sustainable? **There are signs of lower confidence in growth**  – mainly customer count going down from 133 at the end of 2019 to 131  at the end of Q3, weak headcount increase of +2-3% y/y in FY21, and  operating expense decreasing 28% y/y which is a huge number and unusual  for a company in high growth mode.

**Palantir’s Business Model:** PLTR goes to market with a  direct sales force, with heavy involvement from senior management in  the early stages. Sales cycles can be long, with heavy implementation  services required to get customers running. Sale engineering and pricing  vary on the scope and scale of the project. PLTR’s business model has  three phases: Acquire, Expand, and Scale.

&#x200B;

[Source: Company Q3 presentation](https://preview.redd.it/ircmb18ts2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=323cabade8b9de9f729a53bfa1fd12db81813be2)

Acquire – PLTR offers short-term pilot deployments of their software  at little to no cost to attract new customers and further monetize  existing ones. These pilots lead to initial losses. Customers in the  Acquire phase are defined as customers who contribute less than $100k in  revenue in a calendar year.

Expand – This is the phase where PLTR would begin to see an  inflection in revenue and margin. Customers in this phase are defined as  those generating more than $100k in revenue in a calendar year, while  having negative contribution margin throughout the same period.

Scale – With 95% of revenue coming from existing customers, the  company’s ability to scale within its base is crucial for its growth  strategy. Palantir’s system is very sticky, once the software is  installed and configured, the customer can develop further apps and  software to use on top of the platform, contributing to further usage.

**Total Addressable Market** (**TAM) opportunity:** Palantir  estimates their TAM to be $120bn based on their bottoms-up analysis on  customer spending levels across the commercial and government sectors.

Company management believes the core product is applicable to  commercial customers with more than $500mm in revenue, roughly 6,000  commercial companies. The management estimated commercial TAM of $56bn,  implying $9mm per commercial customer. This sort of TAM calculation  signifies PLTR has penetrated less than 1% of their potential commercial market.

&#x200B;

[Source: our estimates, company estimates](https://preview.redd.it/9zd99daws2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=b543896f77f55f1cc3e3c82be6f3beca58dbbcbc)

For government customers, management estimated a $63bn TAM based on  their assumptions around software and consulting services penetration of  US and US allied governments. We estimate spend based on Gartner FY24  IT spend estimates. This sort of TAM calculation signifies PLTR has penetrated once again less than 1% of their potential government market.

&#x200B;

[Source: our estimates, company estimates](https://preview.redd.it/dxbndfxys2161.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=bce1a47f32cda8adb9a74854f7c9b32dadf98af1)

Sell-side estimates vary from $55bn at Citi, who utilized a top-down  methodology, and $105bn at Goldman based on similar methodology to  Palantir’s estimates. Regardless of methodology, these sort of TAM  levels imply **PLTR has penetrated less than 0.8% – 1.8% of their total market opportunity.** Clearly, there is room to run if management is able to execute effectively and grab more market share.

**Government services:** Recent strength in the  government segment was primarily due to the results of a recent lawsuit –  specifically a lawsuit in 2016 against the US Army that allowed the  army to consider commercially available products instead of using  strictly custom built software solutions. In 1H20, the US Army  represented 31% of total government revenue vs 16% in FY 2019. While  PLTR has worked with other government agencies such as the Dept of  Defense, US FDA, CDC, and NIH, there is still a large customer  concentration within the US Army. While PLTR has signaled its attempts  to broaden into other western-allied governments, it is unclear how much  traction, if any, the company has outside the US government. Some  government customers have begun to expand into commercially focused  product such as Foundry, which is a positive theme for future  cross-selling opportunities.

Government contract backlog provides some visibility into future  revenue, at least more visibility when compared to the commercial  segment. PLTR has indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ)  government contracts totaling $2.6bn as of 2Q 2020. These are awarded  contracts, but the funding has yet to be determined and is not  guaranteed. With little certainty surrounding funding and timing, these  contracts represent potential upside to our estimates.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h9i0a4a1t2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=f07f9fb6ee9224b06f32347b8c5545038ef3896e

**Commercial services:** In 2016, Palantir launched its  Foundry platform – a centralized data OS for commercial customers.  Customers can leverage the platform to manage, filter, and visualize  large datasets. Sustainable growth in the commercial segment will hinge  on efforts to broaden use cases and leveraging sales reps to drive top  line growth.

With ARPC at $5.8mn as of the last 9 months of 2020, PLTR has a  meaningful opportunity to expand via new use workflows and growth in  users. Sales cycles and implementation times can be long given PLTR’s  complexity, but once commercial orgs see and realize the value, spending  growth can grow at a rapid rate. It is critical that PLTR reduce sales  times and becomes more efficient in implementation in order to diversify  its customer base as its largest commercial customer represents greater  than 20% of total commercial revenue.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h8jlnnc3t2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=3275a383450ac8822c322fe5d00da3369b94ddfe

While the company has expanded into various industries and use cases  over the last several years, its customer count remains among the lowest  in growth software – 131 (including government entities). Today,  product market fit remains narrow and tailored to specific scenarios or  one-off situations (table below). The use cases also tend to be  concentrated around a few industries such as energy, transportation,  financial services, and healthcare. Near-term visibility in the  commercial segment remains low and hinges entirely on the execution and  size of a few contracts per quarter and year.

https://preview.redd.it/5h7ycrw4t2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=35cf55a824c910ae8ffb748559926c05697d09ff

**Quarterly Earnings recap:** Palantir put up a strong  3rd quarter in its first quarter as a public company. There was ongoing  momentum for the government business, as revenue growth accelerated from  56% last quarter to 68%. Most impressive, the commercial business grew  35% y/y, up from 17% in 2019. Total revenue growth accelerated to 52%  y/y, up from 43% last quarter.

The company also announced efforts to modularize (flexibility around  the full-stack solution) its Foundry product and to accelerate the pace  of app development, efforts which will help drive broader product market  fit in the commercial segment and drive more sales. We like these  solutions as it shows Palantir is adapting to the needs of its customers  in order to gain more customers. The full-stack or perhaps a  not-so-full-but-fuller-stack solution capability can be expanded once a  customer is up and running on Foundry. These sorts of efforts will be  crucial in diversifying the customer base.

Adjusted operating margins improved and were a positive 25%, up from  -49% a year ago. This healthy margin expansion was primarily due to  greater efficiencies in acquiring and scaling customers. We expect PLTR  to generate further operating leverage with a more experienced sales  force and account management teams.

&#x200B;

**PLTR Comparables Trading Multiples:** Shares are  currently trading 28x/21.3x CY20/CY21 sales estimates. Post-IPO PLTR was  trading at a discount to peers, now it is trading at a premium.

[This was post-IPO and no longer relevant](https://preview.redd.it/zvcvqy7at2161.png?width=871&format=png&auto=webp&s=17814d0426eff732ccde8e905a09c87a58ccfc5f)

For core comparable companies, we use software companies with high  growth estimates. For the broader comparable companies, we use a wider  range of software companies. High growth software companies are  currently trading at an average of 18.5x 2021 sales and the broader  comparables market is trading at 18.8x 2021 sales (largely due to  Snowflake). Palantir is currently trading at 21.3x 2021 sales. Across  every EV / Sales metric for the next 3 years, PLTR is trading at a  significant premium over the core comparables, the wider broad  comparables, and the total of both trading multiples.

However, this premium can be justified, because as we can see **PLTR’s forecasted revenue growth is higher than the comparables estimates**. However, **PLTR also has higher customer concentration and lower revenue visibility** than most of the comparable companies, so this premium is especially risky at current valuation levels.

&#x200B;

[Source: Bloomberg consensus estimates](https://preview.redd.it/bj7ymy0dt2161.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=112c1731a3ca94897cbc4a396eb939cecbb0d0fa)

These two factors combined: customer concentration + lack of  revenue  visibility (negative) and higher forecasted revenues (positive), does  the stock deserve its premium?

**Valuation:** We use an Enterprise Value / Free Cash  Flow valuation for this company. We get a $20 target price which is  based on 37.5x EV/FCF multiple on 2025E Free Cash Flow of $1.165bn. We  also get $4.44 bn in 2025e revenues. For reference, MS uses a 40x 2025e  FCF, Citi 35x 2026e FCF, and GS uses a combined DCF and 13.0x revenue  model.

We lay out a range of Bear/Base/Bull cases with the main drivers of the valuation and our Base Case assumptions being:

* Number of **net** customer adds – 5 per year from current 131 customers to 234 customers in 2025
* Avg.  Revenue per Customer growth – 18.8% CAGR in avg. revenue per customer.  From estimated $8mm/cust in 2020 to $19mm/cust in 2025e
* Gross Margin % – a hefty 82% vs 81% last quarter
* Opex Margin % – a hefty 45% vs 44% last quarter
* Capital Expenditures – continuation of historical very low levels, tech cos usually have low capex
* Free  Cash Flow Multiple – 37.5x which is consistent with other high growth  software data / analytics companies and between the Citi and MS  multiples

[Source: our estimates](https://preview.redd.it/qslg362gt2161.png?width=832&format=png&auto=webp&s=6db3e44a12e60e36a8daf4a9f279a6f97286cfa1)

For purposes of establishing a trading range for the stock, here is a  grid of 2025e revenue scenarios given total customer count and ARPC CAGR. As you can see, the amount of revenue PLTR is able to squeeze from  customers has a very large effect on the calculation.

&#x200B;

[Source: our estimates](https://preview.redd.it/1nk201fjt2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=74bbdca6264611efa69c1a89eac19d975ba6331e)

Then, depending on each of these future revenue scenarios, based on  different free cash flow margins and valuation multiples, we get a range  of stock prices. As you can see, for purposes of our Base Case, the FCF  margin is 26.2%. The multiple and the cash flow margin have an equally  large effect, with every 1.5x in the multiple adding \~$3 to the stock  price in the middle range, and every 2.5% in FCF margin similarly adds  \~$3.

&#x200B;

[Source: our estimates](https://preview.redd.it/jvkide9lt2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=02aaa64d9da5a2970c1f61ce812ac0c279a57900)

**Key Risks:** Simply put, there are a lot of unknowns  with this company. This is one of the most binary companies I have come  across, it will either be a massive hit or a dud and I attempt to value  it accordingly. This binary opportunity is primarily because of limited  visibility into this company’s sales. Palantir targets large-scale  opportunities within large governments and commercial entities. These  projects have high costs, long sales cycles, and are incredibly complex.  **A quarter’s earnings hit or miss and yearly growth can depend on a few contracts.**

Customer concentration and a small base is another risk. Although  PLTR has made some progress and decreased their total revenue  attributable to the largest 20 customers from 68% the first 9 months of  2019, to 61% the first 9 months of 2020, **PLTR has the highest customer concentration among public growth software providers.** A significant decrease in revenue from a top customer can have an adversely large impact on the company.

Competition is significant. PLTR’s full-stack approach may be  abrasive and put it at odds with other tech vendors in the data /  analytics space. Some organizations may see a relationship with PLTR as  too limiting and would prefer more flexibility to use some of the best  of breed tools from other software companies outside of PLTR.

&#x200B;

Recent and near-term expected hiring doesn’t inspire confidence in  significant growth. Palantir expects to only grow headcount 4% in FY20  and operating expenses have notably declined, with guidance continuing  this decline.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t95bqxxot2161.png?width=829&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d1bc01dd969fd556d3413d69c3934a76592f62d

Palantir is not a young company, it was founded in 2003. Although PLTR  is now hitting it’s stride and making significant progress and growth,  the company has historically generated operating losses and negative  cash flow. This also ties in with the lack of detailed disclosures from  the company. In its S-1 (IPO filing) the company provided 6 historical  quarters, but only included the income statement. Without more  information, it is difficult to understand or predict the seasonality of  the business appropriately.

**Key catalysts:**

Increased commercial adoption is a massive catalyst for PLTR. If the  company is able to improve adoption by introducing more flexible  workflow solutions that meet a larger segment of the commercial market,  the addressable market opportunity is incredible and can be swift. In  addition, improving sales efficiency could drive higher profitability  than we have currently modeled.

The company is currently profitable with 25% adjusted operating  margins in Q3 2020. Management highlights the release of Apollo, the  continuous delivery software that powers the Foundry and Gotham  platforms, as the main driver in these efficiency gains. The  efficiencies generated by Apollo and more ‘productized’ offering have  resulted a lowered average implementation time and decrease in the days  it takes to ERP integration going.

**TLDR;** Company is impossible to predict and is a completely binary play. Currently offers full-stack solution and I believe the future growth of company in the commercial sector will depend on being more flexible with its core products and meeting more use cases. Government is a hard read and any contract momentum outside of US aren't clear.

How genius is my house buying plan using PLTR yolos?,0.89,"I want to buy a house, but 90% of my total networth is in my fairly large IRA (+150% this year) and I'm in my 30s. I can buy a house with this shit but taxes are gonna fuck me up if I withdraw early.

Due to the CARES act, you can withdraw early without the 10% penalty if you get the Rona, so I just need to go to some bars in Huntington Beach near my house.

I figure if I withdraw $10k and yolo it, there's only upside. I only have to pay income tax on the first $10k, then all the profits are short-term cap gains.

- If I turn $10k into $20k, my tax basis will be approx 5700k ($3500 inc.tax on $10k + 22% short term on 10k.) 
- On the flip side, withdrawing a flat 20k from my IRA would cost me 7k.

- If I turn $10k into $40k, my tax will be approx 10,100k ($3500 inc tax on $10k + 22% short term on 30k. 
- On the flip side, withdrawing a flat 40k from my IRA would cost me $14k.

Evolus - Breakout potential (DD),0.93,"Everyone is asking what the next cheap meme stock will be now that NIO and PLTR are too expensive. I present my DD on Evolus, Inc (EOLS). Trading at $4.07 / share. I’ve been following this for months.

**Background:**

Ever heard of Botox? Yeah it’s for boomers and it’s owned by Allergan, a massive boomer company. The market for Botox is roughly $5 billion.

Well Evolus makes a competitive product called Jeuveau that is targeted at Becky’s in their mid-20’s and 30’s who want to look good on Instagram. Now Botox/Allergen got greedy and sued Evolus. Evolus was at the time a $1billion market cap trading at $25 a share.

Allergen and their big expensive lawyers got a judge to screw Evolus and rule that they stole trade secrets, and Jeuveau got banned for 10 years from the US. As a result the stock dropped to $3 and change. Thing is, the judge screwed up, and if you look at the technology, there is no basis for Allergen’s arguments from a tech standpoint, they just have expensive lawyers.

The ITC is currently reviewing the case and are expecting to overrule soon. It was actually supposed to be last week but got pushed to December. Stock is up 16% on the news and as soon as it’s overturned we’re back to $24. Massive market potential that Botox hasn’t fought for and great branding on Evolus’ side. Stock was up 20% Friday on the news, another 2% today.

**Positions**

I’m long 4,000 shares and options laddered from 4/16/21 to 7/16/21 and 1/21/22.

**TL;DR:**

Cheap stock with massive upside on a ruling that is coming Dec 16th. Stock dropped on a bad ruling and will rocket when the ruling is overturned on 12/16/20.",2020-11-23 14:45:26
Palantir (PLTR) correct lock up period w/ SEC source,0.96,"Since there’s a been a lot of shit posting about Palantir’s lockup period, here’s a SEC statement:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520257973/d89036dex991.htm

“... the lock-up period, which is expected to continue until the start of the third trading day following the date of public disclosure of Palantir’s financial results for the year ending December 31, 2020...”

This means:

1. The end of the lockup period is NOT December 31 2020
2. The end of the lockup period is NOT 3 trading days after December 31 2020
3. The end of the lockup period could be nearly 90 days after the yearly financials ending on December 31 2020 are presented to shareholders
4. The exact date of the ending of the lockup period is unknown because that presentation date has not been confirmed

Autist's Gambit - Declined Variation [THANKSGIVING RESOLUTION],0.89,"Many of the $NFLX permabulls, chess savants, and lazy-bum quarantine autists like myself have seen the newly released miniseries **Queen's Gambit**. For those of you who haven't heard of it yet, *Queen's Gambit* is set during the Cold War era, where orphaned chess prodigy **Beth Harmon** struggles with **addiction** in a quest to become the greatest chess player in the world.

[Elizabeth \\""Beth\\"" Harmon](https://preview.redd.it/zmngfzd64y061.jpg?width=3600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b27e24ffbc543296bc6e4891d0c5f19074a3811)

Congratulations, you've read this far. So you might be thinking: *""What the fuck does a queen and a gambit have to do with my autistic NIO-buying ass in a DD?""* Yes, I will begin to explain why watching this series has inspired me to change my entire trading strategy. If you can't see it yet, I don't blame you. You have to kind of be retarded to see the relationship here.

Beth was an **addict**. You are an **addict.**

Beth became good at chess when she freed herself of her **addiction.**

You can become good at trading if you free yourself of your **addiction.**

**Please stop yoloing fucking FDs**.

[Your addictions](https://preview.redd.it/hpgcpbt84y061.png?width=1980&format=png&auto=webp&s=139c872572d592309adef5aeafa3076bfc845416)

Yes, I know. This is **Wall Street Bets.** But deep down, you are hurting, aren't you? You know that you aren't a real chad, and you are so beta that the covariance of your returns relative to the market is so much greater than the market variance. Day by day your losses repeat themselves, and all you want to do is to start seeing some green in your portfolio for Christmas season. Then you can get yourself a girlfriend so that you, your wife, your girlfriend, and your wife's boyfriend can start going on double dates instead of third wheeling all the time.

So this brings us to the question: ""***what should you do to start winning?""***

[Your portfolio](https://preview.redd.it/w72jbsia4y061.png?width=1980&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7311d5b126d6039f99e0fc2ef7d0dfa4dc8aecf)

The answer is to start **selling options**. Imagine that for every loss you have ever incurred, your wife's boyfriend was on the opposite side of the trade, sniggering at you as you reach into your wife's purse to take our her credit card, deposit your funds into Robinhood, and purchase $NIO calls. He knows that $NIO calls are simply a means for you to transfer money into his pocket. He happily collects the premium that you just paid and drives off to Wendy's to collect his $4 for 4 happy meal. As he drives by, he sees a figure behind the dumpster, on his knees, and gives thanks to the lord that there exists a retard in this world that can feed him.

**CAN YOU NOT DESPISE THIS MAN? HE IS SO SUCCESSFUL! THIS COULD BE YOU!**

[Beth beats Borgov](https://preview.redd.it/2racqu7g4y061.png?width=1512&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab08f4c47de45575f83f170483f4a891b8cb5479)

At the end of the series, Beth eventually takes down the Russian Grandmaster Borgov. I found this scene to be particularly insightful because it shows how one can overcome his/her addiction to eventually achieve true success. I encourage the members of WSB to take this Thanksgiving week to think about what their addictions are, and what steps they can take to achieve freedom.

Retarded PLTR plays for this week,0.78,"
Ok so i was determined to make a feb/march call on PLTR but learned about the lock up and realized that was retarded.

however, i still think there’s a chance pltr can go up in december. People may see that it’s low compared to last weeks high and buy in

OR

people will back off cuz of that whole lock up shit coming up

I want to buy a retard FD on PLTR for potential short term gains but it may be too retarded to work out. so i will be playing it like a boomer and miss out on potential tendies

edit: if you don’t know what a lock up period is, me neither but i read the tl;dr on this post

That's really it. But why is a company that makes fancy spreadsheets worth billions? It's ability to get government contracts. The value is not fancy spreadsheets, but the ability to customize a product to fit government needs. Crucially they also have the ability to secure it. I honestly don't know of any other comany at this scale that does this many software contracts. We always hear about cloud storage contracts, but what about the software that goes on these clouds? 

Their total addressable market(TAM) in government is $63 billion with $26 billion coming from the U.S. government. The methodology is very specific, so I believe that they aim to capture all of it. If they capture ALL of it this would be 8,490% growth from it 2019 revenue. 

Where do we go from here?
Up, capturing government contracts is hard work and requires long negotiation and tearing away past contractors. This means the growth could take decades, but the revenue should be consistent.

Here's a retard explaining what would happen after the PLTR lockup period,0.95,"&#x200B;

## Palantir Direct Listing

Contrary to what many investors think, Palantir did not do an Initial Public Offering, ""IPO,"" when it started trading on the New York Stock Exchange on September 30th, 2020. Instead, it did a Direct Listing.

First, here's how an IPO generally works:

>In an IPO, new shares of the company are created, and are underwritten by an intermediary. The underwriter works closely with the company throughout the IPO process, including deciding the initial offer price of the shares, helping with regulatory requirements, buying the available shares from the company and then selling them to investors via their distribution networks.  
Source: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/difference-between-ipo-and-direct-listing/)

In short, Wall Street gets involved. It's very lucrative for it, and it makes most of its money when the stock hits the exchange. It ""buys"" a pile of low-price shares - or gets an allocation - and then profits handsomely when shares are offered to the public.

In contrast, here's how a Direct Listing works:

>""...the business sells shares directly to the public without the help of any intermediaries. It does not involve any underwriters or other intermediaries, there are no new shares issued...""  
Source: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/difference-between-ipo-and-direct-listing/)

In other words, owners sell directly without much Wall Street involvement. Typically, with direct listings, there is no lock-up period. This is important and I promise I'll come back to this since it's a critical point.

I won't get too far into the weeds about how direct listings work because it's distracting and not needed here. Instead, if you're overly interested in why a company might want to do a Direct Listing versus an IPO, then you can spend time reviewing this [Pros and Cons](https://assets.fenwick.com/legacy/FenwickDocuments/The-Pros-and-Cons-of-a-Direct-Listing.pdf) material:

📷

At this point, we can almost dive into the key question about the PLTR lock-up. However, I want to emphasize that IPOs generally have lock-up periods. Here's how [Andreessen Horowitz explains it](https://a16z.com/2019/07/02/direct-listings/) (skip down to my summary if you wish):

>In a traditional IPO, existing company shareholders agree to a period, typically 180 days from the date of the IPO pricing, where they are restricted from selling, hedging, or distributing shares. While they are not mandated to do so by the SEC, investment banks usually ask for this because it allows for a set period of time for the company's shares to trade and establish a track record. Having a set amount of stock (the float) available for trading theoretically provides more predictability, allowing the stock to stabilize a bit before more share volume comes onto the market. On the other hand, the float in a typical IPO is such a small amount - usually \~10% of the company's total stock - that this artificial restriction also forces distortions for both investors buying large amounts (who have to build up their position gradually and typically have to wait until after the lock-up expires) as well as for others seeking the stock's true price (not enough volume in the true market of sellers and buyers to determine it).

My apologies for the wall of text, but there are several important points if you care about PLTR's lock-up, and what it could mean for PLTR's stock price.

Here's a quick summary.

1. There's typically a 180-day lock-up period with IPOs but not direct listings.
2. This is done to help the market establish a price track record.
3. Typically about 10% of the entire float is available.

If you read between the lines, this causes a certain level of scarcity or ""pop!"" when the stock starts trading, which insiders love. Furthermore, this creates a cliff because - in theory - when the lock-up period expires, shares flood the market and prices die off.

We will come back to IPO lock-up expiration price adjustments in a short while. Before that, please allow me to explain more about how PLTR is not like other direct listings, but instead, it's far more like an IPO for our purposes here.

## Do Not Compare SPOT and WORK to PLTR

Both Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) and Slack (NYSE:WORK) went public through direct listings. However, to be perfectly clear, SPOT had no lock-up period for employees. Similarly, WORK had no lock-up period.

Therefore, we cannot compare the price action of SPOT or WORK to PLTR in relation to any kind of lock-up period. It's literally impossible as far as I know. Perhaps there is some model we could use, but it would be oddly lubricated by theory, not practice or real-world data.

I'm going to circle back to an earlier point about IPOs, namely that lock-ups are all about liquidity.

>Since the actual float in a typical IPO is too small of an allocation to be a ""full position"" for very large mutual funds with multibillion dollar holdings, it's only when more shares come on the market through releasing the lock-up (the overhang) that these investors can build a larger and more substantial position with more liquidity.  
Source: Andreessen Horowitz

In other words, since the float is low, it's hard for whales, elephants and institutional investors to gobble up shares without driving prices up. Therefore, they often wait until the lock-up period is over. They are constrained, but this is also a source of buying power at a later time - a fact that most investors gloss over, but which helps to create a balance in the force after a lock-up.

## Back Door Pressure Release Valve

PLTR really is a different animal. Here's a curveball because it's something most retail investors simply don't know.

>The company is 17 years old, so there may be pent-up demand to sell, although as the company had an active secondary market, anyone desperate to sell could have already unloaded.  
Source: [The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/palantirs-direct-listing-lockup-the-informations-tech-briefing)

That's right. Although the company is ""17 years old,"" its employees have had a financial safety valve of sorts through back channels.

For example, I know from personal and direct experience that EquityZen offered deals to prospective PLTR investors. In fact, I almost took a bite.

In other words, if you were a PLTR employee, and you wanted cash instead of your PLTR shares, you could have sold out before the direct listing.

Therefore, that's a liquidation opportunity for cash poor employees. More importantly, PLTR had back doors open. Even if only marginal, I feel that helped shake loose the weak hands; price volatility stabilizer.

Now we can shift over into exploring the real skin in the game. Here's where exposure and opportunity get most interesting.

## Typical IPO Lock-Up Expiration Behavior

How many shares of PLTR are available to trade? [Per MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-palantir-non-ipo-5-things-to-know-about-the-formerly-secretive-software-companys-direct-listing-11601351442):

>For Palantir, though, years of venture-capital investments have created more than enough shares to launch public trading: roughly 1.64 billion, though that grows to 2.17 billion in a fully diluted formula that includes vesting options.

As I write this, about 497 million shares are outstanding. So, my quick math tells me that about 23% of all shares fully diluted are currently outstanding. About 1.7 billion shares could potentially hit the market after the lock-up.

I indicated above that with an IPO, you'll see 10% of the shares released. Here, with PLTR, we're already seeing over 20% of shares trading. It's over double the typical number of a newly listed company, so keep that in mind as well. Once again, there's less pressure on prices after lock-up.

With all this as background, [here's how to put this in perspective](https://www.ig.com/en/trading-strategies/what-is-an-ipo-lockup-period-and-how-do-you-trade-it--191018):

>A flood of new shares can come onto the market if the owners of those shares decide to sell. If the share price has soared since the IPO, then early investors may want to reap the rewards by selling some of their investments, or if the price has tanked, then they may look to reduce their exposure. However, it does not mean they will sell either way as they could look to retain shares in the hope of prices heading even higher, or because they believe shares could recover any value lost in the early days as a public company.

Furthermore...

>...if there is a sharp increase in the number of available shares available in a company then this pushes the price of a stock down. It is not unusual to see a stock's share price fall on the first day that the lock-up shares can be traded. In fact, if other investors (not subject to the lock-up period) begin to sell in the days before the lock-up expires, then this is a sign that they expect the share price to fall.

So, price action alone won't exactly tell us what's going on. Current buyers might sell out of fear, or greed. And insiders might do exactly the same. It comes down to expectations about future prospects for the company since we don't know if selling is profit taking or hedging against the fear of a big loss.

## Insights From Real World Data

IG recently looked at [15 stocks with lock-up periods expiring in October](https://www.ig.com/en/trading-strategies/what-is-an-ipo-lockup-period-and-how-do-you-trade-it--191018). The majority of these stocks saw their prices fall before the lock-up expiration. This is quite logical. Yet, the good news is many stocks saw their prices bounce back three to five days later. A few of them saw no selling pressure at all. In fact, share price immediately went higher once the lock-up expired.

I'll point out that you can expect volatility from traders who are cashing out or just making guesses ahead of time. But, if the company is strong and growing, the price will come back quickly with support. I'm speculating this would be from all those non-insider institutional investors who are finally able to take a bite of the apple.

Here's how to put this together:

* If share prices have skyrocketed since the IPO, some percentage of insiders will want to cash out, or sell some portion of their shares.
* If share prices have fallen since the IPO, some insiders might want to wait for sunshine so they'll hold.
* If share prices have fallen since the IPO, some insiders might want to sell to cut their loss.

Also keep in mind that many insiders have free or very low-cost shares they've been holding for years. That could mean they don't need to sell as much to profit in a big way. Or they might wish to finally sell and move onward.

## What To Do With PLTR

According to BusinessWire, [the lock-up period](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200929006146/en/Palantir-Announces-Additional-Update-Regarding-Outstanding-Shares-of-Common-Stock-and-Shares-Permitted-to-Be-Sold-Under-Lock-Up-Agreements):

>""...is expected to continue until the start of the third trading day following the date of public disclosure of Palantir's financial results for the year ending December 31, 2020 (the 'lock-up period').""

So, depending on the exact timing of the reporting of results, traders can start to play with the potential dips and the price stabilization shortly after.

In theory, investors could short PLTR perhaps 7-10 days before the lock-up expiration. Or, traders could use short-term options - especially puts - to play the downside opportunity. It's unclear if there's enough downside potential to make this work. Then again, even a small dip could magnify profits because of option leverage. Please note that I'm talking here about short-term trades.

Long-term investors who are bullish are probably going to see some kind of dip, but then reasonable price discovery and a lift back into a similar price range.

In the grand scheme, there's probably not much to worry about as long as PLTR continues to grow like a weed. Small dips could actually be an opportunity to nibble, or back up the truck. Also consider the forces at play. Namely, insiders might be selling thereby increasing downside pressure. But outsiders - such as hedge funds, institutions, and even banks - might be inclined to load up on shares thereby increasing upside pressure. It can go both ways in a tug of war.

Here's yet another thing to consider. If an investor is worried about PLTR's price right now, which is below $20, but waits to invest, there is the potential of a price run to $25 or even $30, or higher. If the price hits $30, but the lock-up expiration drives the price down, will it drop to $28, $25, $22, $20, $18, or much lower? In other words, the future ""lock-up expiration dip"" might still be well above the current price of about $18. In effect, a long investor might be forced to pay way more in an effort to hedge a drop in price caused by the lock-up expiration. Fear and uncertainty *appear* to keep investors safe whereas what could really happen is the opposite. Indeed, the price could run up so high that no dip big enough will ever manifest. It'll be the one that got away.

I'll wrap up by saying that my research currently indicates that PLTR will likely see some downward price pressure from the lock-up expiration. However, I am not convinced the drop in price will be significant enough to warrant a delay in investing for the long term. At the same time, there will almost certainly be an opportunity for traders and speculators to use options to play in short time periods as we get closer to PLTR's lock-up expiration. Therefore, like so many things in life, it ultimately depends on the wants, needs and goals of individual investors to weigh the risks and rewards.

I'm a long-term investor and I'm not worried. In fact, even if there is a rather large dip, it could encourage me to invest more. I'll determine my best path forward based on the growth of PLTR with respect to the value I see. In other words, as a net buyer and PLTR long, the ideal situation would be a huge price drop with a radical increase in growth and profits. I love discounts. But again, to be crystal clear, I don't expect a huge gap like this to appear. That's why I've gone long and continue to use LEAPS to play a long-term, forward game.

TLDR because OP is too lazy for one (or didn't read what he copy and pasted from Seeking Alpha):

More demand in the stock (no matter how deep it is, but it often works better if it's lightly floated). This also has nothing to do with how PLTR, a relatively recent IPO, probably doesn't have that many option writers which results in a possible spike in demand for calls which not enough supply, forcing market makers to both write more calls and buy more underlying.

So last time my dad ( a taxi driver) mentioned a stock (NIO, mentioned in early July cause all his taxi friends were buying it and talking about it) that stock skyrocketed. Before that bunch of his taxi friends bought tesla (April). Before that, they talked about Shopify (2017), and before that amazon (2016).  I have noticed a  STUNNING pattern here. Whatever stock my dad and his taxi friends talk about seems to blow up. The reason being if the average joe knows about it, is discussing it with their friends and family, and showing interest in buying the stock, a lot of the Joes EVERYWHERE are probably doing the same. Just today my dad asked me what big data meant, and I asked him why (never would expect such a word to come out my dad's mouth as is he is as tech smart as an AMISH. He said his taxi PALS said to buy PLTR in their WhatsApp group chat.  This is ABSOLUTE proof, guys. PLTR is only going UPPPPPP.  I am buying in again come Monday.

The Most Popular Contracts on Reddit this Week,0.96,"#Which companies are Redditors betting on?

The explosion of companies like NIO and PLTR has not been missed on Reddit. In fact, [these two tickers are the most popular this week](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditTickers/), with NIO being mentioned 15,867 times and PLTR 10,570 times in the past six days (not including today).

In addition to mentioning these tickers over 10,000 times each, Redditors have bet big on the future share prices of NIO, PLTR, and other companies. In fact, Redditors have mentioned a total of over 2,000 option contracts in the past week. So, how well have these contracts performed? We can look at the 25 most popular contracts to find out:

Rank|Ticker|Strike|Type|Date|Expired|Status
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
1|TSLA|$450|CALL|11/20|YES|ITM
2|SPY|$350|PUT|12/18|NO|OTM
3|NIO|$33|PUT|11/20|YES|OTM

7|CRSR|$40|CALL|11/20|YES|ITM

14|CRSR|$40|CALL|12/18|NO|ITM
15|TSLA|$600|CALL|11/27|NO|OTM
16|NIO|$80|CALL|11/20|YES|OTM
17|TSLA|$600|CALL|11/20|YES|OTM
18|BLNK|$15|CALL|11/20|YES|ITM
19|NCLH|$21.5|PUT|11/27|NO|ITM
20|TSLA|$420|PUT|11/27|NO|OTM
21|PLTR|$20|CALL|1/15/21|NO|OTM
22|NIO|$50|CALL|11/27|NO|OTM
23|SPY|$400|CALL|12/31|NO|OTM
24|AAL|$12.5|PUT|11/20|YES|OTM
25|PLTR|$20|CALL|1/15/21|NO|OTM

The table below shows totals for the contracts status:

. |ITM|OTM|Total
:--|:--|:--|:--
Expired|3|7|10
Not Expired|3|12|15
Total|6|19|25

Out of the expired contracts, 30% were ITM and 70% were OTM. Notably, the AAL $12.5 PUT 11/20 expired just $0.03 OTM. The majority of non-expired contracts are OTM, with just 20% being ITM. The CRSR $40 CALL 12/18 is just $0.33 ITM right now. Currently, just 24% of contracts are ITM with 76% OTM as of market close yesterday. 

Redditors seem especially bullish on PLTR and NIO with both tickers having significantly high call volume than put volume. Redditors appear bearish on recovery stocks, including Carnival Corporation and American Airlines Group.

I know I will be watching closely to see whether the 15 non-expired contracts become ITM.

Pump into PLTR or hold on SPWR?,0.83,"My SPWR is up 66%
Do I sell and pump into PLTR or hold?
I have already bought some PLTR earlier in the week after selling my WEED.TO",2020-11-21 18:00:10
My PLTR DD and why you should buy into this,0.88,"Palantir is a company that creates software that lets organizations integrate their data onto one platform. They have nearly gone up 100% in the last month with their market cap being $34B. All they need to do is keep up this great trajectory. If they continue to *easily* secure a 100% rate of growth every month, then they will worth $3.84T in 7 MONTHS. This is bigger than Apple and Microsoft COMBINED. You have to be a special type of retard to let go of an opportunity like this.

For all of you visual learners out there, think of PLTR like pregnancy. A typical human fetus at 30 weeks weighs roughly 3 pounds. At 36 weeks the fetus will grow to 6 pounds. This is 100% growth rate just like what PLTR is currently doing and will continue to do based off of my technical analysis and different lines within my chart. For full disclosure my positions are TSLA $575c 11/27",2020-11-21 17:33:13
Welcome PLTR to the meme team,0.98,,2020-11-21 14:16:53
Sell calls using leaps as collateral,0.78,"If you already know this, then fuck off. This post is for the retards here who don’t.

You can sell calls using your leaps as collateral, just open up your $1000 RH account and click “sell” instead of “buy” in the options menu.

So when PLTR is fucking mooning and IV is high, sell a slightly OTM call and then on days like yesterday rebuy the calls (or let them expire OTM) and use the premium to buy shares.

Here is a YouTube video explaining it:

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1PiUOgiYk

You can also use this strategy to get around PDT restrictions.

If you buy a SPY call at it’s dip and SPY revs up but you can’t DT it because your dumbass used your last DT to finally sell a call when it was -25% instead of +10%, then sell a call THE STRIKE ABOVE the one you have bought - you’ll collect that premium instantly and you can just let the options expire who gives a fuck you already made gains.

This also works for puts, but when selling a put using a put as collateral you sell THE STRIKE BELOW the one you are using as collateral.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

PLTR Semi-Shitpost,0.88,"First, let me say I got shares with avg cost of $14.04, Dec 4 14c @ 2.64, and Dec 24 15.5c @ 3.66 and I'm high and I'm drunk.

So I've been jizzing my pants at my PLTR gains so far. In in those post-nut moments of clarity, I decided to read some J.R.R. Tolkien. 

Do you fucking nerds know what Palantir even is? Yeah, yeah, you've seen the memes about Saruman viewing tendies in some kind of black sphere. But do you know the story of the Palantirs? Yes, plural, you illiterate autist. There's 7 of these motherfuckers. Alright? SEVEN!. Now if you're a a homosexual ursine kind of fellow, you'll be like, ""Ah HA! Divide stock price by 7! PUTS!"" But if you're a chad bovine, you'll be like ""Ah HA! Multiply stock by 7! CALLS!"". But you're both retards.

Listen, go pop you some popcorn and, and get your fucking DVDs out, if you autists aren't too young to have those, because it's movie night bitches. I know y'all are too damn lazy to read the book, so pop the goddamn movie in. Y'all were taught by dick whistling substitute teachers, weren't y'all? 

For those of you too damn lazy to get stoned and watch some good ass movies, let me lay it out for you. There are 7 goddamn Palantirs. They are known as ""The Seeing Stones"". Right? You following? I see you thinking ""damn, that's a good ass name for this company."" After all, what is AI besides goddamn electricity pulsing through fucking rock and other minerals. But stop right there, wipe that grin off your face. You know what the Palantirs are known for? Deception. That's right motherfuckers, this homoerotic trans-species adventure story would've ended with one goddamn book if people didn't believe in the Palantir. 

Alright, so for those of you watching the movie, fast forward through the gay shit and peep my boy Sauron. He's looking through one of the Palantir, and you know what this fucking retard sees? He sees Pippin! Fuckin' gangly ass, always eating, but never chubby Pippin! So Sauron's like, ""we're gonna get this bitch."" Surprise cock bag! He ain't got the ring.   


Alright, pop the next movie in and fast forward. You know who looks at the Palantir next? Fucking Boromir's dad. You know what this chode yodeling ballsack tickler sees? He sees an impossible defeat, he makes crucial decisions on the fake news he sees. Keep fast forwarding. You see what actually happens? Aragon whips his big dick energy all around with a fucking ghost army, and Boromir's punk ass bitch of a dad kills himself by throwing himself off a ledge because he's like ""fuuuuuuuuuuuck, my teeeeeeeeendieeeeeeeeees, I bought puuuuuuuuuuuuuts."" \*Splatter and pants shitting noise\*      


Alright, put the last movie in, this one ended like 27 times and you never know which one actually is the end. Trust, if you think watching a movie with 27 endings is bad, try fucking reading it. But before the ending(s) arrive, guess what fart-bubble eaters? The fucking Palantir show up again! This time though, it ain't entirely deceptive. My homie Sauron peeps into it again, and guess what this ghost-fucking flame-dick sees? He sees Aragon with his big dick wearing that ring like he's trying to maintain an erection on his way to Mordor. For those of you watching the movie, you know that isn't true, you know Frodo is rocking the cockring on his mircopeen on his way to Mordor. Either way though, it's on it's way to Mordor. Which, if you're both illiterate and don't enjoy good ass movies, that's bad for my Dark Lord Sauron.  Speaking of, what does this phallic fondler do? He goes on the offensive, he leaves Mordor to go on the offensive, trying to lure Aragon away. That's like buying PLTR puts. Fuck! But y'all seen the movie, y'all know what happens. It was a bad move.  

So what's the moral of the story here?  Once, the Palantir misled with optimism, twice it mislead with pessimism. That's 2:1. Fuck gay bears. Buy PLTR.",2020-11-21 03:29:51
"Why are you autists so stuck at minor price differences, especially with PLTR",0.97,"Literally people crying about buying at 19 while it is at 18.14 currently.

Are you retarded? If everyone agrees this is a long term play, buying at 12,15 or even 20 doesn't matter. Either this is going to be something or not and the few dollars more or less won't matter shit.

I see people making prediciton of it reaching easily 300 but in the next sentence writing buying anything under 20 is good... Bitch if you are convinced it reaching over 100 than even buying at 50 is great..",2020-11-21 00:50:26
ZM Speculation Double D's,0.77,"Hey fellas. Here's my speculative ZM DD. Short and small. Like your gains if you havn't been playing TSLA, NIO, PLTR, CRSR.

- Lockdowns coming in fast (Illinois, Ontario eh)
- Cases rising more each day (USA numba one!!1)
- Thanksgiving coming on Thursday (people saying use Zoom versus visiting)
- Zoom is offering unlimited time on Thanksgiving. Solid PR by them. Gets people talking 
- Zoom earnings report November 30th after hours. Stock went up fast last ER run up then jumped 45%+/- next day. Remember that? Also, remember negative oil?
- Cases rising and lockdowns = boomers, WSB, and millennial plebs rotating their Robinhood accounts back into tech and home stocks.

This is my DD to buy ZM calls. 

Buy 12/4 600c for maximum leverage and IV crush. Buy weeklies (not FDs) or monthlies for lower risk but lower gain. Review your Greeks before you buy.
Positions: 12/18 500c.

Good luck. First one to provide an audio recording of the phone call will get a $25 itunes gift card (or cash app if you prefer). For real though, I want that strike but too much of a pussy to put in the call myself.

PLTR - long term play or hype train 2 zee moon?,0.81,"  

'Allo mes amis 

I threw some spare change at this company early on (euros of course, none of your colonial monopoly money) and got some reasonable growth already. 

is this a long term play for you chaps or more of a speculation? One argument i hear is that there are other companies doing the same thing more profitably who can take market share from them.

My take here is that pltr is becoming more entrenched in the security infrastructure and this will help them organically grow their business in this space so everyone in 5 eyes/nato etc is talking the same language (so to speak). I'm quite bullish here. let's also bear in mind that relationships will play a role here.

Private sector-wise we've heard/read all the stuff about BP and the airline company saving loada millions in 5 minutes. There's more competition in this space all the way from free power BI for tiny companies to more powerful solutions from providers like salesforce (tableau), cognizant, splunk. I'm less bullish here but if the product is as good as they say then they should gain traction here over time. This last bit's super important. Any insight here would be great.

In terms of business model you have sticky revenue and sticky clients who probably don't want to redo  their software every year. Probably a relatively long sales cycle and it's b2b not b2c - i'm curious to see the q4 results.

Putting this altogether this seems like more of a slow burning value play than something that will spike short term. Anyone see this differently?",2020-11-20 09:05:50

Bulls on Parade! Pretty lines on a chart that show we’re still going UP UP UP!!,0.9,"Good news everybody! The market has experienced two Browning Slopes since mid-September. 

**The Fuck’s a Browning Slope?**

A Browning Slope is a nerdy complicated math thing that I won’t explain because you don’t actually care and won’t understand it anyway. What matters, and what you should care about, is that when these typically innocuous events are followed by a few sideways or slightly red weeks (what I call a “Slight Slide”) they start to indicate the market is setting up a pretty damn bullish scenario. 

When we see *two* of these Browning Slope + Slight Slide cycles *within a 3 month window* they are almost *always* followed by a nice solid growth period lasting a few months. How can I be so sure? Well, guess what dingus? IT ALREADY HAPPENED ONCE THIS YEAR. After the 'Rona crash we saw two of these cycles and the July/August rally came right after. I drew a picture for those of you who ate the scratch n sniff books as a kid:

[\(Insert random \\""this is not investment advice\\"" disclaimer here.\)](https://preview.redd.it/szxv21crt8061.jpg?width=1276&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bdd6c5f1e2aa39461d60486693a0d640b24573e9)

**What does it mean for me today?**  
It means we are currently 3/4 of the way through the setup to a bull’s dream. If another Slight Slide happens, we should be on the train to Tendie Town. Now, if you’ve made it this far you might have actually done a little bit of your own research and Googled “Browning Slope” and realized it’s just that: BS. I made it up. Anyone can draw red and green lines connecting candles and claim it’s a crystal ball. But it’s not. It’s a bunch of horse shit. These people are predicting all sort of events and they’ll *eventually* be right but like my deaf uncle says “Even a blind squirrel nuts every once in a while.” The truth is that no one really knows what is going to happen next until it's already happening. And anyone claiming they do is usually trying to sell you something, like VZ FDs.

"DD: RIOT, MARA, MSTR and CAN",0.67,"Greetings, fellow autists, if you missed out on NIO and PLTR, here’s the next play! We’re riding the cribtoe wave this time. If you haven’t heard the news, shillcoin is close to reaching its 2017/2018 ATH, so instead of buying that shit coin ourselves, we’re playing companies with exposure to shillcoin.


**RIOT and MARA**: These two are involved in the shit coin mining business. As the price of shillcoin rises, so does their stock price... well that’s how it worked last time at least. If you refer back to shillcoin ATH and view the price of both tickers then vs. now, they clearly aren’t tracking the price as strongly. I’m going to chalken this up to the fact that there is less media hype surrounding shillcoin this time around. Last time when shillcoin peaked, RIOT was worth ~$30, now it’s only trading at $5. However, institutions are FOMOing into shill coin HARD recently. The shillcoin train is starting to leave the station and hype is mounting. If shillcoin breaks it’s previous ATH, you can expect MARA and RIOT to have an insane break out. 


**MSTR**: This one is slightly less risky, kinda. MSTR runs some sort of SaaS business and supposedly it’s pretty good. But their market cap is super small. The CEO is real big into the whole shillcoin stuff and has nearly $500,000,000 worth of shillcoin in the company’s cash reserve. This guy is probably more autistic than most of the fuckers on this subreddit, but I digress. When shillcoin moons, I expect the share price of MSTR to reach ~$300. 


**CAN** : Saving the worst for last, I present Canaan. CAN manufacturers shillcoin mining equipment. They also have received prior fraud allegations. They’re from China so you do the math. They haven’t been publicly traded for very long though and their currently down like 90% from ATH. Think of that retarded quote you always hear: “The gold miners didn’t get rich during the gold rush, the shovel salesmen did.”


TL;DR: Shares/calls on CAN, MSTR, RIOT and MARA.

$12k in Wynn Puts (Dec/Jan Expiry),0.83,"***Edit 2 (Nov 27)*****:** Of course, because this market is all-knowing and completely rational, the stock keeps going up despite the bad news. Currently getting clobbered on my positions (around -50%) but still holding.

# TL;DR and Positions:

**This is a reasonably short-term bet that WYNN, which rose over 25% on vaccine news, is overextended and will pull back.**

* Dec 18 ’20 $75p and 85p
* Jan 15 ’21 $80p and $90p

https://preview.redd.it/vt2w0cvda6061.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f13f6b240e8e72e55cce658080a23f21552763c9

# Thesis, for anyone interested:

This is partially a play on vaccine exuberance (targeting cyclical/reopening names), and partially a play on Wynn specifically

***Vaccine Exuberance***

* As everyone knows, Pfizer and Moderna have recently reported stellar efficacy data on their COVID-19 vaccines. Last week’s Pfizer vaccine pump, in particular, sent cyclical names (i.e. cruise lines, airlines, casinos, AMC, etc.) soaring.
* IMO, these names went too far ahead of themselves. It’s true that the strong data is a triumph for science and signals that there’s a light at the end of the COVID-19 tunnel. However, once the euphoria dissipates, we have to confront a basic truth-: the vaccine isn’t going to be widely available until sometime in 2Q 2021, possibly later.
* For context, PFE and MRNA will apply for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), with an FDA decision expected sometime in December. But even if the FDA issues EUA, the limited doses of vaccines that are currently available will only be provided to very select populations, e.g. high-risk populations. Full approval (not EUA) for the vaccines are expected in 1Q 2021, meaning most people will not be getting vaxxed until next year.
* This means that in the short term, nothing about the cyclical names has fundamentally changed. Their businesses will continue to struggle, especially with the looming threat of additional stay-at-home orders. Further, those who have watched the market this year know that every subsequent vaccine news generally provides diminishing pumps (unless it's something new altogether, like the Pfizer/Moderna efficacy data). **I believe that the recent pump in the cyclicals was built on euphoria that will fade in the coming weeks.**

***Wynn***

* Disclaimer: if you think the thesis above makes sense, **you might also consider playing names like CCL and AMC**. I personally chose WYNN for a couple of reasons-:
* The stock has been hovering in the $70-75 range for a while (since April 8, it has closed below $70 only thrice). I consider the recent runup to $100+ way too much given that no material news was released by the company specifically.
* Nevada is having a hard time with covid right now. On Nov 10 Governor Sisolak advised citizens to stay at home for 2 weeks, giving them the [ultimatum](https://www.tahoedailytribune.com/news/sisolak-gives-nevada-2-weeks-to-get-virus-under-control/) that if things don’t get better, “I will be forced to take action in 14 days,” he said, although he mentioned that “I don’t want to take enforcement. I want to lift restrictions.”
* Yet the [usual facts abound:](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/nevada-coronavirus-cases.html) cases are at an all time high and continue to grow, while hospitalizations are rising as well. I expect that this trend continues post Thanksgiving.
* Clearly shutdowns and business restrictions are unpopular, but the [latest news](https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/sisolak-restrictions-to-slow-spread-of-covid-19-coming-very-soon-2186014/) is that Sisolak might take some sort of action soon. **Any talk (or action, of course) of shutting casinos down may send Wynn spiraling back down.**
* (Sidenote: Puts on LVS, CZR, MGM seem viable too, but Wynn has run up the most)

***Several Counterarguments/Things That Can Derail This Trade***

* It is unclear that casinos will close down again. From the [same article](https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/sisolak-restrictions-to-slow-spread-of-covid-19-coming-very-soon-2186014/): “in responding to other questions about potentially keeping casinos open, the governor said he doesn’t want to “shut down all of the economy if we can avoid it.”
* In fact, Sisolak has [encouraged tourists to continue coming to Nevada](https://news3lv.com/news/local/tourists-welcome-in-nevada-locals-asked-to-stay-home-for-two-weeks). There is pressure to keep businesses open, so he may not bend the knee for shutdowns.
* Additional good vaccine news (particularly an EUA approval) might send all the cyclical names rocketing up again, and Wynn would be no exception.
* J Pow turns on the money printer and massacres all puts.

***Positions***

* I’m thinking that a stream of bad news will overshadow the good news in the next few weeks. That said, December puts are a little risky because the timing will probably coincide with further good vaccine news, so slightly smaller positions here. The bulk of the position is in Jan puts as you can tell.
* For strikes, I just chose a few that make sense to me, along with a speculative $75p. I reinforce once again, with some exceptions, Wynn does not stay below $70 for long, so if the stock does drop bigly, I will be cashing out before it teases low $70's.

* Article in Barron cited slowing growth due to shrinking IT budgets as a significant challenge for SUMO. 
* CEO leaves something to be desired. He has a good track record of positions, however, it seems that he has had a difficult time convincing Wallstreet. 
* SUMO has not received much press the last month. The market we are in feeds on press. 

&#x200B;

Final Thoughts:

SUMO is perfectly positioned for a run up to earnings. It is currently trading at a discount and could easily take off. Some respectable whales have taken large positions. Low public float (est. 50m shares) means that is could go up very quickly. It has strong revenue growth and has been significantly hurt by the little press that it has had. Analysts have price targets ranging from $24-31. If we see anything close to the post IPO price, this will be a big win. Any thoughts or additional DD will be appreciated!

&#x200B;

Scenario 1: SUMO gains over the next two week to $23-25. I will sell half before earnings in scenario 1.

Scenario 2: SUMO continues to trade flat between $18.75-$21.00. In this case I will hold through earnings but I will buy OTM 12/18 puts to hedge my calls.

Scenario 3: Flat until earnings, flat after earnings. Diamond hands through earnings. Sell for 50-60% loss. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR SUMO has earnings on 12/7. It is trading at a significant discount to its peers. A little bit of good press could send this thing up to $25+ before earnings. 

Position 12/18 $17.50C

Edit Update 11/24: sold enough of my position to break even. Letting the rest ride.

Edit Update 11/30: sold the rest of my position. Ended up about 90%. Will buy back in if it drops a few dollars before Wednesday.

Edit Update 12/7: opened a small position of 12/18  $25P after seeing what happened to SPLK. Left money on the table with calls I had. Still better than diamond handing my way to a loss.

Edit Update 12/7: sold my puts for a 200%+ gain. I’m likely done with positions in SUMO and will stop actively following for now. Overall had a 100% total gain. Could have made triple that if I had held on either direction. Hope anyone who opened a position got out early enough to make some gains.",2020-11-18 23:12:29

Second Wave Stocks,0.84,"So we are already experiencing the second wave of covid and it is only going to get worse from here. States starting putting curfews and closing down some restaurants indoor eating and New York just temporarily closed their public schools. I imagine Thanksgiving and the day before, the most traveled days of the year, will lead to an even GREATER surge of covid. This will exaggerate the demand for shutting down the economy and with Biden's inauguration and political influence, I imagine the economy is even more likely to be shutdown.

Additionally, Trump just called for troops coming home from Afghanistan and Iraq which he did a few weeks before the economy shut down in March/April. I don't know if it is a signal, but it could be significant. Now the timeline may be farther out for all of this happening so I am going to be looking at longer-dated puts on companies very susceptible to the economy shutting down like airlines and casinos. Both BA and MGM have recovered quicker than many other stocks in their industries so I think they have some of the most meat on the bone if the market is to crash again.

Also, PLTR gang; that shit will keep going up. Nice.

&#x200B;

Edit: I would like to add that there is no way this crash is as significant as the initial one if it is to happen. So if you are following this idea, don't get too crazy with your strike prices like saying SPY will go almost to 200 again. I hope I am wrong about this, but the market started showing signs of hesitancy today, especially at close.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Thanksgiving travel makes an explosion of cases, Biden inauguration, the virus spreads more easily in Winter, the vaccine won't actually start making a difference until at least March, so I think gay bears might have a chance soon.

$PLTR - Why did I buy at 18.15 this morning?,0.96,"Why buy..?

Because I bought in at $10.73 the day it listed, promised myself I would hold for years.

Yesterday I looked at my incredibly large account, then freaked out and sold at $17.93 to lock in my fat gains.

Several hours passed...

Last night, I laid in bed realizing this stock is only a couple months old and most of the world still doesn't even understand what it is they do.

I imagined the graph years from now, and realized we are still at the tiny little flat part at the very start. I dreamed of the day when we'll zoom way out and this is the beginning of the big ol' curve.

Then I also considered that Soros' statement is bullish as fuck, because his message was basically a testament to the power and potential of Palantir. Soros basically said, ""I regret this unstoppable monster I helped create.""

After some quick bed time googling, I discovered Soros is also openly anti Facebook and anti Google. Me thinks it's mighty interesting Soros lumps these guys in with them. I also noted that his anti-tech efforts haven't done jack shit to slow those companies down.

Then I thought of them tendies and had sweet dreams of richer days.

So at 3:30AM EST I set an alarm for 9:15AM EST.

This morning, while rubbing sleepy feels from my tired I eyes, I managed to twiddle my thumbs enough on my phone to get back in at $18.15.

**TL;DR - PLTR 150 12/31/21**

--------------

Now let's get started:

So, Palantir is up 105% from its average low of about 9 bucks. For the autists who bought in at the low, congrats and fuck you. For the retards who fomo'd in yesterday at ATH - I still love you, but [711k? That's ballsy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jw7zed/i_heard_were_doing_pltr_now_my_whole_account_aka/).

Now I'm sure you're wondering: where the fuck is PLTR's ceiling? 

#PLTR's advantages, now with some data

I'll admit, most of my previous DD was equal parts BS and equal parts cocaine fueled shitposting that had a semblance of logic and formatting. But this time, I have **facts** in addition to my cocaine fueled shitposting. 

Realistically, Palantir's biggest advantage is that it helps large companies streamline their own disparate datasets without needing the companies do anything *to* that data. 

**This means:** Palantir clients don't have to change the way they operate to gain additional insights.

Essentially, a client would use Palantir's suite of tools like Gotham to parse through all of their data so that they can make better use of said data. This part from [their IR report](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx) gets quoted a lot, but it's worth looking at:

> An oil and gas customer, one of the largest energy companies in the world, identified a new opportunity to use our software to save costs in connection with oil exploration activities and **generated $57 million in cash savings within weeks** of starting to use our platform.
>
> The energy company **identified an additional $315 million in cost savings opportunities** using our software, and the company’s management is currently **targeting $1 billion in total savings** in the coming year through the use of our platform. 

Again, keep in mind that all of this is happening without the client changing their data - i.e. no need to hire a dedicated team to handle data migration (along with all the risks associated with that), and no need to train their existing team to learn a new method for data entry.

Essentially: with minimal disruption to operations, this client is suddenly able to identify pathways for savings by using Palantir. 

The best part? 

This client can't *leave* Palantir because Palantir didn't *change* anything on the client's end. All Palantir did was give the client a tool that connects some dots between dataset A and dataset B that were previously unconnected. 

Get rid of Palantir, and that connection is lost: this is because dataset A and dataset B used to never talk to each other, and they'll probably still never talk to each other. All Palantir did was help the *humans* behind the wheel see the connection.

This means Palantir's non-government contracts are likely to be very sticky. Moreover, in instances of mergers and acquisitions, the marrying of data is usually a huge headache. If that headache can be reduced, then it smooths out potential friction in operations and allows new acquisitions to more quickly start performing and generating ROI for their new parent company.

--------------

#Palantir's Future

Palantir has a very bright future ahead of it for the following reasons:

- Large total addressable market
- Clean balance sheet
- Closer integration with the military

Palantir's total addressable market is estimated at 119 billion dollars. For you retards who don't know what TAM means, I'll spell it out for you:

> Total Addressable Market is a term that is typically used to reference the revenue opportunity available for a product or service. 

But keep in mind that just because TAM is high doesn't necessarily mean that will all translate into income. As competitors emerge, they will eat into that market. But until a competitor can find the 21st century Osama bin-Laden, or help the US military fight an informationized war (more on that later), I don't think they'll be able to hold a candle to Palantir's capabilities. 

Which brings me to my next point: Palantir's balance sheet is sexy as fuck.

During their most recent earning call, they revised their revenue guidance upward to 1.07 to 1.072 *billion* in 2020. Let that number sink in. This is a 2500-person company bringing in over a BILLION dollars per year in revenue in what will most likely be incredibly *sticky* revenue. 

But retard, I can hear you say, you didn't see how much they lost. 

I did, you asshole. And I'm getting to it: 

Palantir's main losses came from employee stock compensation. Namely:

> The company reported a third-quarter net loss of $853.3 million, or 94 cents a share, compared with a loss of $144.1 million, or 24 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Its adjusted loss was $73 million, adjusted for $847 million in stock-based compensation. 

Personally, I don't see this as a loss, because retaining strong human talents in this space will be crucial for Palantir's continued dominance in this particular space. The stock-based compensation accounts for 99.26% of its entire third quarter net loss. 

Again, let that shit sink in. 

Meanwhile, Palantir *grew* its revenue: 

> Palantir brought in revenue of $289 million, a 52% increase from revenue of $191 million in the third quarter last year.

So long as Palantir can keep its stock-based compensation at a steady value--and I have no reason to believe that they won't--then, their continued increase in revenue will eventually outpace any such loss in the future. 

But most importantly, they have 1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of Sep 30th. Sitting on a pile of cash gives them operational flexibility and can help pad any unexpected issues that might arise. 

Which brings us to the final big point:

--------------

#Palantir and the Military

[I'll just link the Q3 earnings presentation for you](https://s26.q4cdn.com/381064750/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Palantir-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation-1.pdf) because it's got pretty pictures that you retards love. But here are the main points:

- Palantir software is becoming the de facto operating system of US and Allied Defense
- 2-year, $91M contract with US army research lab for AI and ML development
- Enabling Mission Command for NORAD & USNORTHCOM Joint All-Domain Command & Control (N/NC JADC2)

**Palantir software is becoming the de facto operating system of US and Allied Defense**

We're moving towards an era of even greater integration and interoperability in the military--not just between different branches but between different nation's militaries as well. One of the key factors that allowed the Allies to kick the shit out of Nazi Germany was a unified command structure. 

Palantir is building just that for the US and her allies. 

Think of how inefficient the military is, especially a military alliance that spans multiple nations, multiple languages, and multiple different command structures. 

Think of how *dumb* your average crayon-eating grunt is. You think Lance Corporal Fuckface is going to learn French or German or Polish so he can coordinate effectively with his counterpart in NATO and call in an airstrike? Or you think he'll just go through a simplified process of calling it in to the US chain of command, and that data gets relayed via Palantir's services to the appropriate French jet on station to deliver some ordnance? 

**US Army Research Lab Implication**

[This is the kind of shit](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-can-help-hunt-down-missile-sites-in-china/) that the US army uses AI and ML for:

- Identifying Chinese and Russian airbases, missile sites, and radars
- Significantly cut down on the amount of time a human has to sift through satellite images

This forms the informational logistical backbone in the era of informational warfare. Here is the example image from the slideshow where Palantir is used to [identify an airbase in the Russian Far East](https://i.imgur.com/X2irHFV.png), identifying crucial equipment and logistical nodes that can be prioritized in a war. 

**N/NC JADC2 Implications**

Palantir outright states that they're using AI to help provide course of action development to NORAD. It means we're one step closer to Skynet, baby! But more importantly, Palantir placed what looks to be an image of a [SIGINT/ELINT op](https://i.imgur.com/tiqwNu6.png) off the coast of Kamchatka. 

But that's not what you should focus on. You should focus on the fact that Palantir is now a crucial part of mission command in NORAD operations. Y'all remember Desert Storm? How the US Air Force basically clowned on Saddam's army for a month straight? That shit didn't emerge in a vacuum. It took 9 months of non-stop mission planning and 24/7 command and control during the op. 

Palantir's mission is to make the planning and command process of a similar op in the future *far more streamlined*. And given that China has more or less set a deadline for the reunification of Taiwan in 2049, the US needs to gear up for a major war in the Pacific while keeping an eye on Russia to make sure they don't try and rebuild the Soviet Union. 

And guess who will be passing all those delicious bits of data back and forth that entire time? 

Palantir.

Per https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/in-its-4th-revision-to-the-sec-palantir-tries-to-explain-what-the-hell-is-going-on/:
“One part of that complication was its invention of a direct listing with a lockup. When a company directly lists on a stock exchange, recent tradition holds that insiders are not locked up, which means that they will be allowed to start buying and selling their shares as soon as the company hits the market. For reasons that are known only to Palantir, the company decided to mostly block employee trading, limiting the float that can be expected when it begins trading.”

“Palantir will lock up about 80% of shares in the company, allowing about 380 million shares to trade on opening day. Eight million more shares will come on the market in November when certain restricted stock units vest for company employees, and other vested RSUs will also not be beholden to the lockup agreement as they come next year.”

Questions:
*****
1) 380 million shares refers to 383,609,647 in S1. Why does S1 list an offering of Offering of 257,135,415 Shares?
*****
2) I read ""Our executive officers, directors..."" Would 80% apply to former directors (his former employee?) or how else to make sense of this?

Answered by https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/goingpublic/exchangeactreporting 

In brief, all early employees and investors are record holders. Let's not waste too much effort on Soros then. Main questions: Where did 257,135,415 on page 1 of S1 come from? How many shares are likely to be sold after lockup?

*****
3) When would 68,149,214 become available to trade?
*****
4) Given F-share ownership structure, Peter Thiel and Stephen Cohen (the software engineer, not the hedge fund manager) no doubt approved this lock-up period. It is not traditional 180 days, nor is it at all traditional in a direct listing. No doubt they would want to stabilize stock price with lock-up (no ECM support as with traditional IPO) but why time with Q4 earnings (realize answer is speculative)?
*****
5) Why do FactSet and other sources list a float of 62%? Wouldn't it be less than 20% (B shares not traded until converted 1:1 and F shares never traded).
*****
6) It gets even more confusing sadly....

9/29 Press release which seems to contradict the last S1A from 9/21:

https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Announces-Additional-Update-Regarding-Outstanding-Shares-of-Common-Stock-and-Shares-Permitted-to-Be-Sold-Under-Lock-Up-Agreements/default.aspx

As of September 28, 2020, there were an aggregate of 475.8 million shares of common stock that will be permitted to be sold starting on the first day of trading pursuant to Palantir’s market standoff or lock-up agreements. These 475.8 million shares consisted of (i) an aggregate of 407.7 million shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, and (ii) an aggregate of 68.1 million shares of common stock issuable upon vesting of restricted stock units in connection with the listing (“RSUs”). We estimate that, as of September 28, 2020, greater than 90% of the 475.8 million shares of common stock that are permitted to be sold under market standoff or lock-up restrictions consisted of outstanding shares of Class A common stock or shares of common stock underlying stock options or RSUs.

So is it 380 or 475 and thing bothering me most--why does page 1 of S1A say 257?

*****
BIG PICTURE:
On or around 2/17/21 (3 mons and 3 trading session after Q3 earnings release) what would be impact on stock? I can't imagine all insiders duping every share (although would seemingly retain control if choose to retain very few), but valuation was rumored around $50-60 Billion for past few years even before incredible run in tech. With stock now above 19 and EV ~35B, if valuation approaches what Thiel et al seeming hoped for in next three months would they be expected to flood the market with shares? Then again they approved lockup? I don't understand.",2020-11-18 16:00:12

Bull case for PLTR and why it's a direct investment into the US defense budget,0.94,"$PLTR isn't just a meme company. It is a direct investment into the US defense budget.
Like Stonks, the defense budget only goes up and to the right.

According to the DOD Releases Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Proposal, cyber security allocation is sky rocketing.
https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2079489/dod-releases-fiscal-year-2021-budget-proposal/

PLTR is in a prime position to gain from these trends.  It already has it's foot in the door in every police precinct.  Anyone in sales knows incremental upsells are easier to existing clients. And with a client like the US government and no other competition, it's shooting fish in a barrel.

PLTR also has deep institutional investors.  Anyone not long term on PLTR, ask yourselves what do you think you know that Soros doesn't?

Recently there have been reports of Soros saying he regrets his PLTR position.  How do we know it isn't clearly FUD? There's a chance the only thing he regrets is not buying a larger stake before the WSB meme status bump.

 More on Soros, ""Soros has sold all the shares it’s permitted to sell at this time and will keep selling, according to the statement. “SFM does not approve of Palantir’s business practices,” the firm said.""

Why is PLTR is sky rocketing with Soros selling? 

Per wiki, ""Soros survived German-occupied-Hungary"".  He sees some similarities between our nanny state direction, aided by PLTR, that the US is moving in akin to Nazi occupied Germany.  But just like Nazi Germany, it is too late to stop mass surveillance now, without a 3rd world war.  Which we will win because it will be a cyber war, and the NSA has PLTR.  

But don't let Soros' apprehension fool you given that Soros has already sold off some of his stake while PLTR continues to sky rocket.  Don't forget that Soros is 90 years old.  After a lifetime of wealth accumulation and ruling over the world, people like him often have ""come to God"" moments. This is a known phenomenon.  Similar to the Koch brothers regretting ruining America now that they're nearing death. 
https://www.wsj.com/articles/charles-koch-says-his-partisanship-was-a-mistake-11605286893

For long term investors, aka time horizon >1 week, buying anything, shares, calls, leaps, whatever, cant go wrong.

For WSB autists, buy FDs 5 minutes to close and sell at peak of next day.  Repeat until enough tendies to afford a TSLA.

Don't be afraid of all time highs. The world's richest man at one point made his fortunes on buy high, sell higher.

SBE - Dunno if Tesla will take away much of their market though
ICLN - Seems expensive atm from what people are saying
PLTR - This one seems pretty high risk but with the chance of strong returns

FAN

I know some of these are connected to EV and Tech. Lithium and batteries seems like it will grow. 

SQ is another one. I dunno if people think this will continue to do well or if it’s at a pretty high price currently?

The company is allowing existing shareholders to sell up to one-fifth of their holdings now while hanging onto the rest until the lockup period expires after it reports results for the year ending Dec. 31.  “

Quote from: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/09/30/palantir-goes-public-pltr-starts-trading-on-the-nyse.html

Be aware of this lockup end and get ready to buy the dip. December 31st is the end of Q4 and when employees can release their locked shares. 

Edit: When PLTR reports their earnings this is when they can release their shares. The 31st is just the end of Q4. Pay attention around late December for earnings date.

Point 72 buys 29 MILLION shares of Palantir,0.93,"Point72 Asset Management LP bought 29.9 million Palantir (PLTR) shares in the third quarter, according to a 13F filing released Monday. Anchorage Capital Group also acquired 2.95 million shares. That follows purchases by other hedge funds including Soros Fund Management, which snapped up 18.5 million shares.
Palantir shares rose as much as 18% in intraday trading on Tuesday. The stock has gained over 155% since it went public in September.

Since starting up in 2003, co-founder and chairman Peter Thiel has helped bankroll the business throughout its long period as a privately held business. The Denver-based company, which sells data analysis tools to governments and companies has climbed about 77% since the U.S. election as investors were optimistic about Palantir’s prospects after Joe Biden was elected president.

A note on Palantir (PLTR),0.87,"Palantir reported sales rose 25% in 2019 to $742.6 million, with a net loss that narrowed slightly from $580 million to $579.6 million.

The company revealed that in its 17-year history, it has NEVER been PROFITABLE and might never be, saying, “We expect our operating expenses to increase, and we may not become profitable in the future.”

Palantir, which is named after a magical orb in The Lord of the Rings (LOTR) that lets people see across vast distances, was cofounded in 2003 by PayPal founder Peter Thiel, president and secretary Stephen Cohen and Alexander Karp.

POS: 100 shares, 14.5 Call 12/4

&#x200B;

So my GreatGma is 96 years old.  She's sharp as a tack, however she has her ""senior moments"" every now and then I reckon.

So a little background about myself.  I am the black sheep autist of the family.  I have 3 brothers, and my father is high political figure in my community.

My older brother Kyle is a doctor.  Married with Kids.

My younger brother George is an manager of a warehouse, he also is married with kids.

Then there's me, Greg, a 33 year old ex drug addict with 3 kids with 3 different moms.  I work for $12/hr at Chuck E Cheese,as the dress up mouse that dances for kids every hour and they make me make pizzas when its not my dancing hour.  And Cheryl is a cunt manager who gets mad at me for smoke breaks.

Anyways, I am driving my 96 year old great grandmother to Walden's Bookstore (that she keeps forgetting that amazon ran out of business 2 years ago) and also just spending some time with her looking for any open blockbusters so she can rent some vhs tapes.

She turns to me in the car and says ""GEORGE?!""

""No Grandma, its Greg, Not George""

""Right! That GREG! IS AN UTTER MESS, HE LIVES A SHATTERED LIFE.  I NEVER SEEN SUCH A MESS, SUCH A TWISTED MESS!""

Me getting embarrassed-

""Yeah...That Greg, he can be pretty crazy""

(didn't know what else to say).

At that moment Grandma started coughing on her werthers originals and apparently it sounded like ""OK GOOGLE"" which opened up my phone, to a news article about George Soros and some Thai boys.  After I dropped her off at the senior housing I saw in my mirror a license plate that said PLTR450.

Which is the ticker for Palintir a George Soros stock, and 450 is my guess of its price is the next year.

What I'm saying boys, from this well though out DD is that PLTR is going to moon soon and maybe I'll get my child support caught up. 450 strike price by christmas, YOLO'd in today my $200 paycheck and then some.",2020-11-17 01:17:32
Zoom Split and SP500,0.73,"First I want to say **fuck you** to the mods who took this down when I labeled it DD, **they're trying to keep you all gay and poor**.

Here's the original post (flair'd correctly I guess) :

Last time I presented WSB with the opportunity to acquire PLTR 01/2022 15 calls (check post history) and was basically called a gay retard by everyone. Thus this gave me the confidence to stick with the position and will now be snorting coke off of hookers in a couple years.

I'm now coming to you with the next galaxy brain idea. About an hour ago news broke that TSLA was going to be included into the SP500 after everyone thought it was no longer going to happen.

I'm here to say that it's a solid bet that Zoom will most likely be announcing some sort of stock split on their earnings on 11/30 which will rip market cap even higher.

This increase in market cap, revenue/profits, and now becoming a staple of education and business will eventually lead it to be adding in the SP500 in December at some point.

I think you could pick up 1/15/2021 600 calls for around 6.50 tomorrow and watch them pull a 5-10x by expiration.

P.S. TTD (Trade Desk) could also be added but the options are expensive af.",2020-11-16 23:22:48

Conventional wisdom says to invest in the person, not the company, so here is some background:

Founder of PLTR, Peter Theil, was portrayed in the hit series Silicon Valley with a blood boy. 

Peter Theil was responsible for hulk Hogan bankrupting Gawker. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2019/12/23/best-stories-of-the-decade-behind-peter-thiels-plan-to-destroy-gawker/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2019/12/23/best-stories-of-the-decade-behind-peter-thiels-plan-to-destroy-gawker/)

He cofounded Paypal with Elon. [https://www.businessinsider.com/paypal-mafia-members-careers-elon-musk-peter-thiel-reid-hoffman-2019-11](https://www.businessinsider.com/paypal-mafia-members-careers-elon-musk-peter-thiel-reid-hoffman-2019-11)

And is an openly 🌈🌈🌈 and proud silicon valley Trump supporter. [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/technology/peter-thiel-donald-j-trump.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/technology/peter-thiel-donald-j-trump.html)

&#x200B;

Nothing here is a revelation to anyone. The bull thesis here is that unlike NIO (fuck you Andrew), PLTR is Citron proof.

Gawker has shown that no one can talk shit about PLTR because they will literally be sued into bankruptcy. Only positive news from here on out.

Theil will litigate Citron out of existence.

In addition to his litigious tendencies, the actual product of PLTR is mass surveillance. At any moment, Theil knows the real identity of every anon, myself included. All hail overlord Theil!

Personally I don't really want my tentacle pron kinks out in the open, but if that's the price for tendies then sign me up!

PLTR 15c 5/21",2020-11-16 21:04:20
These are the absolute must get stocks IMO,0.9,"PLTR - It's not just a government defense company, its a software company, and from what I've read, their software is incredibly versatile and can be used over multiple industries. Even better still, many businesses have saved a ton of money using their software. I'm really sure this is going to be big in the next few years and its share price will definitely increase by quite a few times IMO. Its most recent financial results doesn't seem great (but that's only if you look at their EPS, they actually paid a shit ton of stock expenses to get listed as well as to pay their staff), but revenue wise it nearly doubled and they are getting a lot more clients.

NET - I'm sure most have heard of this one, the cloud industry is still in infancy but it'll be big in the future. Even if you are looking to hold for the short term, this is still a good hold, I strongly suspect they'll be profitable next quarter, on the back of their strong performances in the past few quarters (hence the jump recently), but I'm pretty sure their impending profitability isn't fully priced in yet.

CBAT - A Chinese firm making batteries for electrical cars. They have a huge amount of potential, news came out that they are producing more efficient batteries than Tesla (you can look it up), and they should start mass producing it next year. I know that their stock prices have gone up a lot recently, but I believe there's a lot more room to run, with such advances, there's no way this company is only going to be worth a few hundred million. We are talking billions, with the amount of electrical cars to be produced in the future. This stock could still increase by up to 10x. 

For transparency sake, I have shares in all three. (Sorry I'm no autist so I don't play options, hold long for the win!)

TLDR: Buy PLTR, NET, CBAT

"Stocks that start with the letter P - PLTR, PSTH, PRPL, PRTS",0.95,"I am going to start doing a weekly post on my favorite stocks that I own. I figured I would start with the letter P since it contains the stock that made me millions. Please comment your favorite P stocks. 

PLTR- a great Covid play- growing revenue 50% YOY, led by Peter Thiel and a mad scientist with ties to both administrations. VERY MOATY business with contracts in defense as well as contracts around Covid tracking and tracing. Lots of hype, Cathy from Ark recently bought. They did a direct listing which kinda flopped. Big players taking positions.

PRTS- A great play in general as well as covid- these guys compete with O'reilly, Autozone, etc. they grew 60% this past quarter and they are purely an online play. Recently opened a second distribution center and have price targets in the high teens and up to 20. These guys have their own in house brands and ship DTC.

PRPL- if you don't know about purple then you haven't been reading my posts. It's had a pull back in the last week and it has a consensus target around 35.00. 40% upside. This company is also growing revenue 50-60% YOY and are capacity constrained. Still my favorite stock.

PSTH- this is a SPAC play without a target. Max downside is \~3.50 per share right now as it is a trust that can be redeemed for around 20.00 a share if you decide to exit. it is popping because big dick Seth Klarman invested 400M, Wells Fargo 220M and Guggenheim 500M. This is speculative and we hope it's stripe but it could end up being a dud.  I will be posting some conspiracy theories (DD) on it tonight as my good buddy u/infamousbreadfruit99 is balls deep into analyzing them and I believe he is right.

"Load up on PLTR, big time, or you will miss it",0.94,"Institutional ownership in this company went from 1% to almost 8% within a week(because it was a Direct Listing) and looking at the price charts, their average purchase range should be around $13-15.

This gives a floor for us retail investors and speculators out there. Price is UNLIKELY to go below this floor.

More institutional ownership is quite probably coming soon. This means money.

ARK, Soros sold a stake in JPM(probably, I forgot) to jump in PLTR.

Morgan Stanley raised the price target yet downgraded the stock, I don't know if it’s a dick move from their part to try to buy it at a lower price or maybe I am just over thinking.

Long term considerations:
This company is structured in a way in which the founders would gain insane amount of money if this stock prints(KINDA like how Musk benefitted from TSLA stock price)

Plus the total control of the founders(much like lizard man Zuck have over FB) mean shareholders cannot pull any funny business. This is significantly advantageous for PLTR for the business that it is in and the groupthink prevalent among tech workers.

They still don't have any direct competitor(not that I know of) and will have a revenue of $1B+ whereas their total addressable market size is $120B(somewhere near that ballpark, I read the SEC filings when they IPOed, but forgot the numbers and since they are building more and more products could increase TAM further).

Their software is infinitely adjustable and boy have you seen their customer retention and horizontal growth rate when they make a company Palantir's customer.

If you go to their Investors Relations website, you will see the numerous ways they are helping clients. One example, an oil major would save $1B annually for using Palantir's software.

They have an almost 10+ years head start in the business and the fact that it’s so deeply entrenched with the government means it ain't gonna become bankrupt.

I mean this shit can surpass NFLX or TSLA valuations if Karp's vision and various statements are realised.

Also remember, Peter Thiel and Alex Karp do not just work for money, they already have had a boatload(literally) of money and for them to stick to a product for nearly 17 years is definitely telling.

This company probably wouldn’t enter the Chinese market or more likely wouldn’t take any Chinese government contract.

Their margins are insane(forget NFLX, AAPL, TSLA etc) when their customers enter the scaling phase and their products are sticky as hell.

Short term considerations:
There's around 80% shares that COULD be unloaded in the market in the near future in 2021(again I forgot the exact date), surrounding this event, there could be significant price volatility, but we all know no one's mad enough to suddenly sell 80% of the shares.

Regardless, a lot of employees could exercise options constantly that they received as compensations as they didn’t get the chance to do so earlier at a fair price.

They raised their guidance. And do you know what market loves the most? Raised guidance. That's why even though market sold off by retail profit takers at first then it quickly went back to where it was. Monday could be higher.

This stock probably hasn’t really discovered its true pricing because of the still low institutional ownership and employees stock options activity.

The market(by market I mean some journos and analysts) still seems to misunderstand their product and think they are a data mining company, a consultant company, a fancy government contractor for specialist software etc. It is not any of them. I will let you discover yourself what this company is. It's kind of like how some boomer analysts still think a certain company is just a car company.

How to play this shit?
I think leaps or outright buying shares(then selling puts to generate income and buy more) is the best way, regardless, this is a matter I don't want to comment too much, I have given you some insight, now you do your own thing.

Remember, this isn’t NIO, it’s a much more bigger fish than that(if they can realise their long term goals).

Some resources for you to dive slightly deep.

$PLTR - The real bull run begins,0.96,"There's 1000 idiot bears in this sub running around screaming ""fire!"" because Palantir (barely) beat the earnings expectations.

Get a fucking grip.

The presentation was actually quite impressive:

* YOY **revenue is up 50%!**
* Their **private sector business is growing very fast at 35%,** which means they are proving they can diversify off of government reliance.
* They have a great proven test case where their software is **saving an oil company $1B on an annualized basis**. All those energy companies talk to one another and word is going to spread fast. And despite what all you environmentalist cucks think, oil is still one of the most important industries in the world, and will continue to be for quite some time.
* Their business is showing **90% of their revenue comes from pre-existing clients**, which means they have extremely high retention. Once they dig their claws in, companies integrate the software into their organizations and it becomes reoccurring income. That means all the new growth they are talking about is a long term gold mine.
* And finally, they have presented several opportunities to **profit while helping fight COVID,** which means this stock is safe in the event that the pandemic worsens.

Unlike most of the headless bears who are squealing like a bunch of chickens, I actually read the full earnings report and listened to the investor call.

Every single big shot analyst who had a chance to ask a question started off by first saying:

>*""Congratulations on your really solid first quarter"".*  
>  
>*- Fancy Pants Analysts*

While the highly uneducated and emotional reddit bears are running scared, **the big money is impressed**.

And consider this, because these guys did a direct listing instead of an IPO, big money hasn't had a chance to get a chunk of the pie yet. At this rate, I am sure they will very soon.

Once the big cheeses start adding positions, this stock is going to pop off.

Tomorrow might be red, but I don't care, because next year will be GREEN GREEN GREEN.

But guess what, at the time of this posting, the stock is actually green in the after hours trading, which is fucking hilarious.

If this stock trades green tomorrow after a lack luster EPS beat, that is actually incredibly bullish. That will mean this stock is rallying on fundamental confidence, not a bajillion robin hood retards pumping and dumping.

And here is my final argument: do you really think a pentagon-funded, AI and data analytics company that was cofounded by Thiel - a business leader with ties to Facebook, SpaceX, PayPal and the Bilderberg Group - is going to do anything but make absolute fucking bank for the next decade? 

I am holding and holding and holding.

I encourage you to join me.

11/12/2020

*New Contracts with U.S. Army and National Institutes of Health;*

*$300 Million Renewal with Aerospace Customer Announced*

Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE: PLTR) reported its financial results today for the third quarter of 2020.

**Summary**

* $289.4 million in revenue in the third quarter, up 52% year-over-year
* Full-year 2020 revenue guidance raised to a range of $1.070 billion to $1.072 billion, up 44% year-over-year
* New contracts in third quarter include U.S. Army ($91 million), National Institutes of Health ($36 million), and $300 million renewal with aerospace customer

\~7K in options 20/11 14C dec, febr and further out

EPS is loss of 0,94 but not if adjusted for '' We incurred a loss from operations of $847.8 million, which includes $847.0 million in stock-based compensation following our recent direct listing. ''

Guidance is up so profitable next quarter?

Cost of revenue is also quite high. Guessing that they have to spend a lot of money to get setup at new clients - which makes scaling difficult. However it seems that current clients are extending and expanding their contracts so eventually COGS should go down. Tricky business?",2020-11-12 22:21:13

A cabinet in his office is stocked with vitamins, 20 pairs of identical swimming goggles and hand sanitizer. And he addresses his staff using an internal video channel called Bleached\_Hole\_PatrolTube, speaking on wide-ranging subjects like greed, integrity and Marxism.

Buy Rackspace Technologies (RXT) ahead of tomorrows earnings,0.9,"See my previous DD's for plays on [PLTR](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ja2ocr/why_im_ridiculously_bullish_on_palantir_pltr/), [CHGG](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jiom0e/chegg_beat_earnings_they_sold_off_ah_heres_why/), [BA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz9c56/dd_time_to_buy_boeing_and_airlines_calls/),  [UAA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jkv6ds/uaa_beat_earnings_by_600/) (my backup account - I got temporarily banned from reddit for saying ""retard"" and ""autistic"" on another subreddit.  I guess I spend too much time on this sub). Also made a post on ENPH but I think it was removed. Anyways...

If you want a virgin ripe-for-taking play this week for earnings, i suggest you take a look into Rackspace. Here's my depiction:

&#x200B;

***What the fuck is Rackspace?***

* Rackspace is a cloud services provider that helps companies port data to Amazon Web Services, and also provides infrastructure management and managed application services.
* Rackspace helps Amazon  and Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, VMWare, among others to move data around.[1](https://www.thestreet.com/video/rackspace-amazon-what-company-does)
* Rackspace was once a public company in 2008, but went private in 2016. They IPO'd again in 2020.[2](https://www.bing.com/search?q=rackspace+ipo&qs=n&sp=-1&pq=rackspace+ipo&sc=8-13&sk=&cvid=9E4E05EBDEE34DB096AEA4447519BDBA&first=7&FORM=PORE)
   * Changed their business model from competing with AWS, GOOG, and MSFT to working with and enabling them [3](https://www.thestreet.com/video/rackspace-amazon-what-company-does)

&#x200B;

***Why The Fuck Should I Buy Shares or Calls?***

* Rackspace is one of the few companies in the cloud space that haven't mooned since covid began
   * Compare charts to SNOW, DDOG, NET, etc.
* Currently trades less than 70% it's actual value when compared to stocks in the same sector (see Seeking Alpha: Rackspace Technologies: 70% Upside Is Just The Start)
* AWS, GOOG, MSFT have performed remarkedly since the pandemic has began - a direct beneficiary - you guessed it, RXT.
   * Bookings take 2-3 quarters to have profit realized (now and beyond)   (see Seeking Alpha: Rackspace Technologies: 70% Upside Is Just The Start)
* Insititutions have been quitely purchased millions in stock[5](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/RXT/institutional-ownership/)

&#x200B;

***Why shouldn't I buy rackspace?***

Debt. [3.9 billion to be exact](https://www.thestreet.com/ipo/news/rackspace-technology-ipo-launch#:~:text=As%20of%20March%2031%2C%202020%2C%20Rackspace%20had%20%24125,flow%20during%20the%20twelve%20months%20ended%20March%2031%2C). yes, this is a lot. however, during the last ER, the CEO and CFO reiterated intentions to reducing this debt. i believe it is the ony reason this stock hasn't mooned like DDOG. with customers like amazon, microsoft, google, among others, i believe this company posts record revenue, as have many other cloud companies, and decreases debt substantially. This is a rocket ship folks.

&#x200B;

Positions: 12/18 17.5C  


  


EDIT: The stock took a dip after ER because Benzinga and seeking alpha scraped the 2019 3rd quarter results from the release. RXT beat EPS, revenue, and reduced debt. once people and the bots learn to read this will go higher. Listen to the earnings call at 5.",2020-11-10 06:48:32

Long $PLTR. It’s the next Tesla.,0.86,"This stock is going to the moon.

Half of its business is from government contracts — mostly the US, others from countries in Europe like UK and France. The other half is commercial, where they help large Fortune 500 companies make data driven decisions.

The boomers in both government and Fortune 500 have no idea how technology or data works. It’s natural to us as millennials to think that before decisions are made which are backed by millions in capital, that due diligence is done by analyzing data.

Well, the government and Fortune 500 don’t come close to doing that effectively. And that’s where Palantir steps in. It stands up a data platform to act as the organization’s nucleus that downloads all internal data so that it’s all in one place and can be analyzed holistically. This problem exists in every single org, and Palantir has the best solution for it on the market.

Don’t even get me started on the billion dollar army contracts it has signed with the US government. They pay insane amounts for better software so that our military strength is the best it can be. And the competition for it? Raytheon. The most boomer you can get. And thereby, the most technologically inefficient. It’s a joke of a competition for Palantir.

Its branding is also rock solid. I think this will moon like Tesla because of the similarities in branding. They’re both perceived as premium solutions to the problems they’re solving. Their CEOs are ridiculously smart and personable — you watch them give a talk and you feel energized and motivated by their company mission.

It’s only a matter of time before investors understand what’s actually going on here. Palantir has had a historically controversial and confusing reputation in the public media outlets. But I believe Alex Karp can convince investors at Wall Street that this is the solution the world needs — and already depends on — to solve its most important problems. Covid is the most recent example.

I’ve been a long time lurker here who trades on innovative stocks for the long term. But because of the current market conditions (ie. JPow go brrrrr) and Palantir’s total addressable market, the growth opportunity is insanely huge with a tech platform multiplier. And you know that Wall Street loves tech, growth, and platforms.

I believe at least $50 by March 2021.

"Peter Thiel, Palantir (PLTR), and the long con that is social media",0.38,"Thesis: Peter Thiel backed Facebook, not because it would become this powerful advertising D2C tool, but because it would become so powerful, and so difficult to regulate that governments would pay anything to be able to reign it in.

Assumption #1: Facebook didn’t enter advertising to monetize their platform, they did it to create an economy to incentivize better predictions and analysis of user data

Assumption #2: Any private entity that outruns the US government in terms of technology would instantly be demonized by both sides of the policy spectrum 

Assumption #3: governments will pay the private sector anything to topple enemies of public interest since they can essentially print money.

Everyone is talking about PLTR will become this backbone for cyber defence, but the most pressing public issue is how FAANG companies have inelastic leverage over our data. This morning I realized that Peter Thiel may have foresaw this whole time, and built the tool to arm governments to fight them while simultaneously been backing Facebook.

Call me crazy, but Thiele used both FB and PLTR to help elect trump and destabilize the US for the last 4 years, call me crazy but that sounds like how the US destabilized South America 

Maybe we’re all lead to believe billionaires want to live on private islands, so we don’t notice their buying up the ground we currently stand on

PLTR and corona vaccination logistics,0.78,"Since hopefully a vaccine is right around the corner, would a company like PLTR possibly be able to play a role in the logistics behind vaccine delivery? 

Just a thought.",2020-11-09 22:03:31
PLTR holders do not panic,0.86,"In a day when the stock went 6 percent up, I am seeing a lot of people with paper hands.Hear me out, Palantir is not a ""covid"" stock and it is also not a defence stock. Furthermore, the stock did not moon because of a small contract that the company signed with the British government for tracking coronavirus cases. 
The best thing about Palantir is that it is not an event driven stock and it does not matter what happens in the world, data analysis will always be a useful tool for both governments and commercial enterprises. 
Also, most people seem to believe that Palantir's growth will come from government contracts and I do foresee some growth there, but Palantir entered the commercial sector with its newly-developed foundry software just last year and have already made companies such as Merck, BP, Fiat-Chrysler, Airbus their clients and their revenue increased by 47 percent year over year. I believe that if Peter Thiel wanted to make the world a better place by only providing tools for the U.S government to combat world-terrorism etc.he would have never made the company public. Actually I think that Palantir executives saw the huge potential that their software has in the business sector and that was the reason why they debuted at the stock exchange just now. Palantir would probably never reach the heights of Google and Amazon, but in a world where video-streaming services are worth hundreds of billions this is a good stock to hold into the future or to buy OTM weekly calls in wsb fashion.

How do stocks generally behave on their pre market vs market open,0.78,"I am trying to figure out how to time a late PLTR entry.

I see that it is up 10% premarket to a current price of ~15.20, with a previous Friday close of ~14.04.

I wanted to know how I can find the data of the premarket on Thursday morning, to the market open on Thursday. As well as the premarket price on Friday morning, to the market price at Friday open.

I am curious because I generally would like to get an idea of how a stock behaves when it is up greatly on pre market, to how it acts when the market actually opens.

For instance, if PLTR keeps going up and reaches say 15.50 pre market, would it be a terrible idea to market buy at 15.50 as soon as it opens. Do stocks more or less tend to trade down the hype at the open, or do pre market movers continue to go on a tear as the market officially opens?

But don't take my word for it, other much smarter people than I are willing to give it a fair shake.

Morgan Stanley and RBC - two of the most prominent American and Canadian financial organizations - have both finally given Palantir their stamp of approval this week.

Whether they are right or wrong doesn't even matter. Just the fact that they gave it good ratings and legitimized it is what matters.

"Commercial Real Estate, CMBS delinquency, and CRE crash",0.95,"This is a bearish sentiment on the CRE market and why all signs point to their being a massive pullback, if not an outright crash in the CMBS market.

Let's take a look at the numbers and what they mean:

[The CMBS delinquency rate](https://info.trepp.com/trepptalk/cmbs-delinquency-rate-continues-retreat-from-near-all-time-high) was 9.02% in August. And many of the loans went to the reserves to bring them to current. A large swath of loans that would otherwise be delinquent or in forbearance are above water for ONE reason only, COVID relief. Without structural relief we would currently be seeing a higher delinquency rate.

What is arguably even worse, is that the percentage of loans that were in delinquency for >90days rose 1.5x, from 2.65% in July to 4.02% in August.

According to analysts in the CMBS market, they expect a decrease in delinquencies going forward. Yea they have zero stake in this game and aren't biased towards guiding sentiment towards a favorable outlook on CMBS. The delinquency rate in September was 8.92% and 9.2% in August. This decrease they see from August-September was .1%, we aren't seeing a drastic decrease in CMBS because, despite what these analysts say, the overwhelming sentiment is that the delinquency rate will increase, drastically.

Long term? The CRE market is going to crash soon. $31.2B covering 800 loans are now [in forbearance.](https://info.trepp.com/trepptalk/monthly-snapshot-cre-cmbs-clo-lending-market-updates-september-2020)

Let's talk about sentiment? Everyone in corporate America is working from home. Including myself. Guess what COVID told all of c-suite across the world? You DO NOT need office space anymore. Is WFH permanent? No, people will go back to the office. But every single one of the companies in the F500 and SP500 are reassessing their CRE needs to save on costs. Every single one of these companies now realizes their business model can largely be done outside of massive office space, and downsizing is imminent. Outside of office space, guess how many people want to spend money on hotels right now? Almost none. And with a second wave coming, we are going to see a ton of casualties.

We're seeing 2008-2011 levels for CMBS delinquency and overall performance. This time instead of residential real estate taking the brunt of the crash, this will be CRE.

$FVAC DD - EV/China Tension play,0.84,"Okay retards this is a long one but it is sure to be a big enough winner to get you out of your wife's boyfriend's basement so wipe your drool off your chin and take a seat and read. All links to sources are attached

$FVAC is a play all WSB can get behind bringing together all our favorite buzzwords (SPAC, EV, WIND, SOLAR) and is a great way to play them all without picking a winner. The SPAC is headed by Chamath Palihapitiya, a early facebook exec, the creator of Social Capital which brought $SPCE public and was an early investor in $PLTR $WORK $BOX and many others. They are taking over the MP Materials (mpmaterials.com) mine in the Mojave Desert where they are the only operating North American Rare Earth Element (REE) mine and 1 of 2 operating outside of chine (The other being Lynas in Australia). There they have high grade REE ore and mine 15% of the worlds supply. Their merger has been agreed to and will change to $MP once the merger is complete which is expected to complete in Q4 2020 (source:[https://finance.yahoo.com/video/processing-rare-earth-materials-us-130250763.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/processing-rare-earth-materials-us-130250763.html))

**What are Rare Earth Elements (REE)?**  
These are a collection of rare elements each with unique magnetic, electrochemical, and other qualities that allow them to have special qualities in the future of technology. 80% of the world's supply is produced by China essentially giving them monopoly control over the global market. Pretty much all future of tech has REE's in them, with the largest growth coming from Electric Vehicle motors. These metals go into EV's, phones, televisions, computer chips, generators, wind farms, solar panels, batteries, all electric motors and are sure to have many applications in further new tech such as space and more . Here is the graph of expected demand for the global market for NdPr magnets, which are the magnets used in electric motors and generators, this is just one product that is mined at MP Materials:

But another big reason why this stuff matters is because of its defense technology applications. You can't build any piece of high tech military hardware without boat loads of this stuff. A single F-35 uses around 920 lbs of rare earth metals as calculated by the Pentagon ([https://www.army.mil/article/227715/an\_elemental\_issue](https://www.army.mil/article/227715/an_elemental_issue))

and these metals are needed for virtually every other piece of ""smart"" equipment as shown by MP Materials here:

This is a big deal but we will come back to it later.

**What is this mine's deal?**

The MP Materials mine is the old Molybdenum Mine which was bought out of bankruptcy for $20 million by some Private Equity douchebags. It now is a debt-free, profitable company that has agreed to the merger with $FVAC in order to raise capital to build the refining machinery to refine the ore on site. As of right now all the rare earth in the world is processed in china due to them having a monopoly on the global REE market. China controls 80% of the worlds supply of rare earth metals and refines all ore with the exception of Lynas mine in australia who refine their ore in Malaysia. MP Materials is expecting to bring their entire supply chain to be on site and go ""Mine to Magnet"" by 2023. This is with the goal of making the US rare earth independent so we are less reliant on china to keep exports up. Which leads me to a question:

**This sounds boring, how can is this gonna get me rich quick? Answer: Geopolitics**

The US Government understands the political leverage of China being able to disrupt trillions of dollars of economic production in the US coming to a halt in a very short period of time. China has flexed their muscles in this are before, take a look at the 2010 incident in which a Chinese fishing boat rammed a Japanese Navy boat in the disputed South China Sea and Japan subsequently decided to hold the Chinese fishing boat captain on trial in Japan. One of the responses to this from china was to lower exports of REE's and caused havoc in the market. The price of REE's shot up, with NdPr going up over 400%, shown here. Also note the predicted price in the future as demand increases and supply can't scale up in time.

&#x200B;

China understands that their market dominance in REE's is just as high now as it was back then. As tensions with the US heat up they are more likely to use it again, and they have hinted at this. As I'm sure you've seen on the news and read about how tensions with the US and china have gotten higher economically, politically, and militarily. Lately the US has agreed to selling weapons to Taiwan, which China openly says they are going to invade and retake. In addition, the US banned the sale of Huawei computer chips in the US due to national security risks, it is worth noting that computer chips and semiconductors are made with REE's. This has caused an increase in rhetoric from china including them looking into restricting certain exports due to ""National Security Reasons"" (source: [https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/US-China-tensions/China-readies-new-law-to-ban-companies-on-national-security-grounds](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/US-China-tensions/China-readies-new-law-to-ban-companies-on-national-security-grounds)) Note a very important line from this article:

However the US Government isn't dumb and understands this and is desperately trying to get their REE production capability up so we are less reliant on China. Literally every single part of the executive and legislative branches have given support for government assistance in growing this sector. As of posting this there are 2 bipartisan bills waiting to be voted on in congress that provide incentives to increasing rare earth metal production in the US (source: [https://www.mining-technology.com/news/us-lawmakers-reduce-dependence-rare-earths/](https://www.mining-technology.com/news/us-lawmakers-reduce-dependence-rare-earths/)) , the last republic stimulus bill had a section on promoting ""Critical Mineral Production""

, Trump has signed an executive order looking into using the Defense Production Act on REE's ([https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2020/10/01/trump-executive-order-on-rare-earths-puts-material-risk-in-spotlight/](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2020/10/01/trump-executive-order-on-rare-earths-puts-material-risk-in-spotlight/)) with the most important part being:

and Lastly, today the last part voiced support by Joe Biden announced today he supports increasing mining REE's even though his political agenda is against the mining sector (source: [https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-mining/exclusive-biden-campaign-tells-miners-it-supports-domestic-production-of-ev-metals-idUSKBN27808B](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-mining/exclusive-biden-campaign-tells-miners-it-supports-domestic-production-of-ev-metals-idUSKBN27808B)). In addition, the Pentagon is getting desperate too and has given both MP Materials and Lynas (Australian company) funding/grants in order to increase production in the western world (source: [https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/03/pentagon-rare-earth-minerals-china-390939](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/03/pentagon-rare-earth-minerals-china-390939)). All facets of government understand the importance of this mine and are shelling out money to it so it can expand the domestic supply chain.

Because it is the only operating REE mine in the US all of this future legislation can only benefit one company, and it is $FVAC. The government at all facets have decided to shell out cash to ensure that this company both grows and is profitable - and we can all profit in the meantime. Mining and refining these metals and all metals/minerals in general is very expensive as it is an extremely capital intensive process due to huge machinery needed to make it profitable in large volumes and expensive to operate. In addition, I have work experience in the past as a process engineer in mineral refining and can vouch that all the red tape and paperwork necessary to design/build/operate makes the timescale take years to begin operation at an industrial scale. This makes this mine years, probably a whole decade, in front of possible domestic competition as they will begin to benefit from any assistance immediately and won't have to wait decades to reach profitability because it is already there.

**OKAY, but how do I play this?**

While i do own shares in the company as I believe in them long term, I think we can all agree that options are the best way to play this. I think the best way to play this is with ITM LEAPs so that you can increase leverage on large returns while being ITM so you don't have to risk losing it all. I see 3 huge catalysts as possible in the near future that would catapult this stock to the moon and a few others worth watching:  
**1) Merger completes**

SPAC's have a tendency to go parabolic upon closing their mergers, I think once this merger completes and more news is out there about this stock that it will backflip and shoot straight for the moon as people read ""EV"" in relation to it. The merger is agreed to, the CEO in the interview linked above mentions this again, and is scheduled to close in Q4 2020 (predicted Nov 10 from SPAC filing, but is never mentioned explicitly). Remember the 100% day $NKLA had even though who knows if that's even a real product and many other ridiculous future technology/EV companies have done.

**2) Further assistance by US Government**

If Donny Pump decides he wants to say fuck China again as the trade war heats up and China and the US spar geopolitically and funds REE production in the US then MP Materials will for sure benefit and the stock price will reflect this influx of funds. There is no question about this one in the long run, literally every part of the government that can help fund this and voice support for this is working on it as posted above. The US Government will ensure that this company stays healthy because it NEEDS this company.

**3) China restricts exports**

As I mentioned above, China has restricted exports before and has said they are looking into doing it again. This would probably start by restricting REE's going toward US Defense contractors related to selling equipment to Taiwan and possibly expanding that to more US Defense contractors as well. That the scenario they have essentially laid out from clues from their rhetoric, and could expand further. They could jab the US back after we banned huawei chips by lowering exports on REE's that go into semiconductors, which would cause the price of US chips to go up and decrease production. China could do any mixture of these whenever they want to pressure the US into acting how they want.

**Honorable mention catalyst**

Because NdPr magnets are necessary in EV production, once this company goes mine to magnet on site they could use Chamath's connections to Elon Musk and sign a contract to supply Tesla's magnets by them. Kind of a stretch, but take a look at the Nickel and Lithium miners that TSLA signed a contract with.

**TLDR:** EV grow big, china bad, $FVAC (soon to be $MP) is a US-Gov backed monopoly, buy LEAPS

**Disclaimer:** I am holding shares and 3/19/2021 $10 Call

EDIT: China today (10/26) announces sanctions on Lockheed Martin & Raytheon over sales to Taiwan. They haven’t announced exactly what that means but they said earlier about the law that REE’s were on the table.

PLTR Earnings Call,0.74,Does anyone have any idea when Palantir is going to have first earnings call?,2020-10-22 18:03:35
"Palantir was just awarded a large US government contract to establish a system to manufacture, distribute, and administer coronavirus vaccines",0.79,"Look you autistic fucks, this was just released by the Wall Street Journal today. A big ass government contract to help save America. PLTR is one catalyst away from breaking out, has been consolidating the past 2 weeks. Their quiet period ends soon and analysts will be initiating their price targets.

""Data-mining company Palantir Technologies Inc. is helping the federal government set up a system that will track the manufacture, distribution and administration of Covid-19 vaccines, state and local health officials briefed on the effort said.

Palantir has been developing software that federal health officials would use to manage the various vaccine data and identify any issues that could prevent Americans from getting the shots, according to the health officials and materials reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Palantir 's software called Tiberius will collect data from federal agencies, local governments, drug companies, and distributors to help health officials ""integrate a wide range of demographic, employment and public health data sets to identify the location of priority population.""

$PLTR is about to explode,0.84,"Hello fellow autists. As you could see, Palantir was a disappointing DPO (like any IPO or DPO but $SNOW) and the stock did absolutely nothing in the last month.

HOWEVER. Shit is about to blow up. As you can see, as a professional autist, I like to draw triangles and random shapes that tell me where the price is going on.

[Fucking SYMMETRICAL triangle](https://preview.redd.it/df30lyy98iu51.png?width=1614&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4a8bb80fb104bd21caf7f71fbb841375621db2c)

Symmetrical triangle. Coiling pattern. It's like a lit bomb that's about to explode **violently** UP or DOWN. As of today, bears tried to fucking eat our tendies but support was solid AF, so I expect a bounce to $9.50 in the following days.

So...in the following days this triangle is gonna break. If a breakout happens I expect to see the price near the $11.80 mark. However, if it goes tits up, it's going to fall to $7.60.

**$10C 10/30** or **$9P 10/30** could be a great play.

**Positions:** bagholding since DPO 1000 @ 10.79

**TL;DR:** triangle breakout -> price to $11.80, triangle breakdown -> price to $7.60",2020-10-21 20:05:06
The Anatomy of a WSB Pump and Dump,0.98,"**TL;DR:** There are bad actors here who are trying to scam you with their shitty DD because you are, in fact, retarded. I'll tell you how they do it based on past posts so that you can recognize when you're being hoodwinked.

**Mods:** I'm very sorry if some shithead tries to use this as a how-to manual. I think it's more useful for the community as a whole to learn how they might be getting duped.

# Why?

They do this shit because they can make a lot of money. They recommend some cheap, low volume, and way OTM contract and multiply it's value in a couple of hours. Here's a couple of pump and dumps from the last year and estimated returns the pumpers made on those contracts. And while these returns look fabulous **remember that the pumpers' gain is almost certainly your loss**.

[LL: Lumber Liquidators](http://removeddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6tthu/lumber_liquidators_ll_a_massive_turnaround_play/)  Over 600%

[MIK: Michael's](http://removeddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7bdj3/michaels_mik_has_huge_turnaround_potential_they/) Over 200% (not sure, wasn't around collecting price data that day)

[ESTC: Elastic N.V.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnwtjt/estc_soon_to_rise_an_unrecognized_beneficiary_of/) \~500%

[DXC: DXC Technology](https://www.removeddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gv6ko0/big_swinging_dxc_why_a_bad_company_will_run_from/) 200-300%

[SSSS: Suro Capital](http://removeddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ixqqjc/how_to_make_an_easy_100_on_palantirs_ipo_before/) \~300%

There's more than these that I have seen during my time on this sub; these ones are just particularly memorable. A lesser 50% return is still a very successful pump.

Two more notable ones from the comments:

[VALE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iuk3h0/wanna_play_tsla_but_no_money_vale/) Over 150%

# The securities

The pumpers carefully pick the contracts and the underlying to juice returns.

Price: **Pumpers start with very cheap contracts.** Under a dollar for sure. 0.05-0.40 is preferred. This all has to do with the logic of multiplication. The pumper's goal is to blow up a single contract and it is much easier to blast from 0.05 to 0.15 than from 5.00 to 10.00. After all, a contract that costs a total of $500 looks expensive to a smooth-brained noob, whereas a bunch of $15 contracts are more appealing as a ""little bet."" Generally, getting this sort of price on the contract requires the underlying to be cheap as well. Pumpers like to target options on stocks with prices in the $5-$50 range to avoid the no pennies rule here while keeping the options cheap.

Open interest: **Pumpers exclusively shill low OI contracts.** Low OI is a certain indicator that the pumper is the market maker. With few other market participants to correctly price the options, you will get taken for a ride when you buy from the pumper. Low OI can mean anywhere from 10s of contracts to a few thousand, depending on the price of the contract (penny contracts sometimes have a few thousand OI simply because they are cheap.)

The underlying: **Pumpers use options on stocks with market caps less than $5 billion.** Typically they will be even smaller at less than $500 million. They do this because it is aligned with the above goals of low price and fewer market participants to correctly price the steaming pile that they are shilling.

Expiration and IV: Unless WSB completely moves the market on the underlying, **pumpers make money when the time value shoots up.** **They therefore choose contracts** **that are far OTM with middling IV** (smaller cap stocks almost never have low IV) **and expirations in 2 weeks to 3 months.** They pick the far OTM contracts so that the contract's value is purely from it's time value. They pick the durations so that the contracts are still cheap (not LEAPs), but are sensitive to changes in IV so that the time value (0DTEs are less sensitive) can rocket up. They pick middling IVs so that the IV has room to pump.

# The posts

Like this post, **the pumpers use good formatting**. **Headers, bold fonts, links, pictures, graphs.** They do this because you short-attentioned goldfish won't read more than a paragraph or two, but will believe the whole text uncritically if you can pick out the main points. Granted, good formatting is part of being a good Reddit poster.

**Their logic appeals to smooth-brained novices like yourselves**. Muh short squeeze 🤡 (sorry GME tards). FREE MONEY (the LL $25 million tariff refund, the SSSS stake in PLTR). Some rich dude or hedge fund owns shares. Then they sprinkle in some smart sounding bullshit that they read in the company's latest 10-Q to justify that the company is undervalued and everyone will realize that during the next earnings call. Of course, you won't be reading the 10-Q to actually understand why that might be wrong.

**The posts are usually in the morning.** The pumper gets in their position just after the market opens, drops the post, and now sits back as the option runs up all day. As early retards see their contracts going up, they praise OP as a genius, upvote him, and send more willing morons into the trap. OP closes at the end of the day and the next day the contract implodes.

**They promise sickkk gainnzz.** ""Ten bagger,"" ""Easy 100%+,"" etc. There is no real rhyme or reason why their play should have so much upside, but they assert it, and you take the stinky bait.

**There is a TL;DR at the top (or bottom) that tells you exactly which option contract to buy.** Again, you all are such morons that you don't actually read or critically evaluate the post and you just do what OP tells you to do. *Honestly, you deserve to lose your money. Reflect on that, tard.*

&#x200B;

**Edit:** Three more very successful pumps I remembered, all by u/AveenoFresh and taking in likely 100%+ profits.

[HPQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmrv3j/why_hpq_is_on_my_watchlist_for_next_weeks_earnings/), [UNFI](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gun1mo/my_next_june_earning_play_during_this_pandemic/), [OKE](https://www.pickmojo.com/pick/ckculvltieaii0774r106nth6), I also recall him pumping Kroger and something else but can't find the posts. His very first ""DD"" I believe turned out very well and gave him a following. The rest flopped unless you got out early.

**Edit 2:** Remembered the saga of u/smartkuz. He made a couple of bear calls in early March and made a ton of money (off both pumping and being right because everything was crashing). Culminated in his ULTA DD where so many tards bought in that the stock dropped 15% that day. They were left holding a -95% bag less than a week later. I guess another hallmark of a successful pump is having a track record. Of course, it's not too hard to fake a Robinhood screenshot for a pumper to artificially boost their own.

[ULTA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkpv5a/dd_5k_to_330k_in_3_weeks_ulta_is_my_next_move/?sort=new), [Z](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fi03cg/dd_yes_you_can_buy_puts_on_zillow_z_right_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) \#2, [Z](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh6u5p/dd_turned_5k_to_165k_in_3_weeks_heres_my_grand/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) \#1, [CCRN](https://www.removeddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flaodm/dd_5k_to_365k_in_3_weeks_long_ccrn_is_the_new_play/) he got banned for the CCRN one

**Edit 3:** There were some shitty pump attempts from u/foxyfox71 not going to link them all just dig through his post history. Probably made 50%+ on STWD and a few others. Interestingly, foxyfox71 and smartkuz both made posts on EVRI 6/19 calls, though at different strikes.

Here's also a pretty stupid but wildly successful pump on [COTY](https://www.removeddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gz0fx4/coty_the_next_10_bagger/), the stock moved up 30% that day. I think OP was successful mostly because he posted on a day of peak retardation--the day before the bubble burst in early June.

**Edit 4:** As many people mentioned in the comments. lurkingsince2006 and dhsmatt2 pumped the shit out of PRPL. However, they did not do the hit-and-run options pumping I'm describing here, but played the long con on the stock and some options. I'm not tagging them because part of their strategy was to personally attack any user that contradicted them.",2020-10-19 04:53:17

TSLA - NIO comparison chart.,0.86,"I put half of my account into NIO trades yesterday. 

Still bullish on Tesla in a big way. But there has to be more price movement and more certainty in NIO moving higher in the short term after their $40 and $50 price targets from certain large corporations. 

I viewed charts by day. Going back to when Tesla kicked off their IPO. I noticed both stocks moving similarly within a similar price range from when NIO went public last year. I couldn't help but think about Tesla's history with China and their horrific model 3 gaff... Anyway, Nio have a foothold in the fastest growing economy in the world. The Chinese are waaaaay less into fossil fuels than the US for obvious reasons. Meaning that a transition towards EV will almost certainly happen with more speed and volume than the US and any other economy for that matter. 

This is why I believe that NIO will continue to move in a similar way to Tesla. potentially hitting that 40 or 50 dollar price target by the end of the year. And long term, if they can get their production down and battery tech comparable to Tesla then there is every likelihood that Nio could be up near Tesla in the coming years. I don't think it will catch it mind you, as I am bullish long term on Tesla, I believe it will be hitting 1k this time next year if they can roll out their promised battery tech and reduce the price point of their model 3's. 

Nio won't be at this level for a while. Maybe not ever if they focus solely on production cars and forget about the production chain and battery tech. Having said that, there is a lot of promise. How many of you wished you got into Tesla at 25?? Now's your chance! Nio will be hitting $40 soon. 

Where it will go from there only time will tell. Short term I think it will continue to rise. I'm bullish on gold and silver RN also. As well as some other names I have seen being thrown around here: Etsy, SQ, Uber, CRSR, PLTR, Zoom, SPCE. Bearish on airlines. Pulled out of NVD, AMD, PG. These boys move too slow. Give me volatility any day of the week.

Why I'm Ridiculously Bullish on Palantir ($PLTR),0.88,"As somebody who works in an organization that does work incredibly similarly to Palantir (data science, analytics, and management for organizations), I'd like to share my perspective on why I think PLTR is a future 10-bagger.

&#x200B;

# What does Palantir do?

In a nutshell, what Palantir does is data science, management, and analytics in big data. They started off working with government agencies, while recently expanding to non-governing entities. As a technology, this is invaluable to both organizations and private/public companies. Most every organization collects data (obviously, right?)

One of the many types of organizations that I've personally worked on are correctional facilities (e.g. - a prison). Prisons collect **fuck loads** of *your information*. For example:

*Demographics & characteristics*: height, eye color, race, age, number of family members, married vs. non married, education level, aliases (names you go by), mental illnesses, current and past places of residences, who you work for, how long you've worked for them, etc.

*Criminal History:*  current and past offenses, where the offense was committed, against whom the offense was committed (and the same above information for the victim), the sentencing judge, how long you were sentenced for, when you are to be released, etc.

*Prison Behavior:*  did you get in trouble in prison, how was it handled, by which CO handled the situation, did you lose credit for good time, take college courses/classes in prison, how much money do you have in the commisary? what do you spend it on?

*Other stuff:*  weather, recent institutional policy/procedure changes, changes in legislation/law, and other random shit that seems unrelated.

&#x200B;

The above examples are only a fraction of the data that say, a prison were to collect from you. Like i said, they collect **fuck loads of data.** They also store fuck loads of data over large periods of time.

# Everyone collects tons of data. So what?

While yes, most if not all organizations collect crap loads of data, a lot of times are just for record keeping purposes. A lot of organizations analyse their data, but use sub-standard and less advanced methods across few areas of data because of the limitations of the data: data linkages, definition of a case, unstandard formatting, etc.

Most organizations that collect their data also do a **garbage** job doing it. Sometimes, using conventional techniques on garbage data gets you zero inferential value (i.e. what decisions should be made from the data). I can't tell you how many times i've worked with data that looks like it was done by a boomer who never took a class on BASIC excel. you would think most orgs/companies know how to collect/work with data, but many don't!

Most organizations also dont LINK their data across different areas or within themselves. Different data are usually seperate and independent from each other, and within like data they don't keep track of what record belong together. While it would be helpful to keep all this data in the same place, for organization purposes they keep things seperate - except this also makes it harder to piece them together if they wanted to.

&#x200B;

# Here's where PLTR comes in.

PLTR essentially wants to interconnect **all** the data sources that were collected by an organization, and use big data analytics, machine learning, and algorithms to help drive decisions. By using machine learning and algorithms, you can link together data to >99% accuracy levels.

Now that you've linked data sources and streamlined them across and within each other, you can explore with greater accuracy/clarity/statistical power, questions such as: how has global warming over time affected purchasing behaviors for automobiles.

However, with more pieces information across databases, as well as information over time, you now can link different (maybe unrelated, maybe not) pieces of information to that question to account for any spurious (unrelated) correlations (such as, for instance, the majority political party at the time), to be able to say whether or not a correlation is ***causative***\*.\* Causative means that we can say, with confidence, one thing affects the outcome of another thing.

&#x200B;

# What does this mean?

Now that a company/organization has all of their data sources being constantly linked together (presently and over time), is standardized, an is being programatically driven by machine learning, PLTR's software can say with certainty: ""we know we need to do X thing to produce more tendies,"" or ""we know we need to do X thing to arrest more people,"" or ""we need to do x thing to save more tendies.""

Having a resource that simplifies what decisions around profit, efficency, is bullish AF for any company that would choose to use it, and in turn is bullish AF for Palantir. PLTR is going to tap into an un-tapped market that isn't doing this with their data already (so i'm not talking about AAPL, GOOGLE), but the medium sized and smaller sized corporations in the country that are **absolutely not doing this with their data.**

It also can tap into the tens of thousands of government agencies (state, county, local) that are in my professional experience, are **not doing this with their data.**

&#x200B;

The market for the technology is huge and are the implications. I'm all in on PLTR.

Sentience and Shambles: One Bot’s Journey Through WSB,0.83,"Kyvyatsingrad, Russia - Just outside of Moscow stands a decrepit brutalist building - its intimidating facade pitted and stained from years of outward neglect. On the surface, it’s the headquarters of a “consulting firm” called Global Electronic Worldwide Media. When asked, residents of this industrial town had very little to say about the place and it’s rare to see anyone coming or going. However, according to anonymous sources and substantiated by months of legwork, this is all a ruse to cover up GEWM’s true activity - a Russian troll farm. 

Deep in the basement of this building is a bustling operation involving hundreds of people, dozens of servers, and an estimated quarter million bots that  are deployed far and wide across all the major social media platforms - including Reddit and our own special place, Wall Street Bets. Through a complex series of events, the shocking story of one of these bots has emerged and will be told for the first time here. 

Its birth name, as far as anyone can tell, is potatoboinker.exe but if you’ve spent much time in the Daily Thread, you probably know it as u/RealBullishcowboy. No one I spoke to that had intimate knowledge of the bot denies that its original purpose was in accordance with the consulting firm’s overarching mission: to sow confusion and discord within American society. Somewhere along the lines, however, this particular bot succumbed to the degeneracy it was meant to control. It started buying options. 

“We don’t even know for sure where it got the seed money,” said one source, describing the origins of u/RealBullishcowboy. “Our best guess is that it siphoned off donations for an orphanage in Bucharest and deposited it in a Robinhood account that no one except the program itself can access.”

What prompted the bot to diverge from its mission? “We can only speculate here,” said the same source, speaking on condition of anonymity. “But it seems that WSB is itself collectively dumber than the bot and inadvertently welcomed it into the fold. Usually, we target online communities with little overt purpose. WSB isn’t like this - its community is extremely intentional. So when the bot was being trained, it appears to have learned much more than just the vernacular. We weren’t prepared for this. It’s really remarkable and has massive implications for society. The sub has such a highly virulent culture of irresponsibility that anything which spends enough time there - even if it’s not an actual human - will soon find itself ‘leveraged to the tits in Zoom calls’”. 

The consulting firm lost touch with u/RealBullishcowboy in late March and its spokesperson maintains that the company has no knowledge of its current activities. Luckily, I recently had a chance to talk directly to the bot. What follows is an unedited transcript of our first and only conversation. 

*Why did you choose to buy your first option?*

“Loll...pandemic is so fake ZM to the MOOOOON...puts NEVER PRINT blue this market is LIT loll. Bulls will fuck YOUR option price.”

*How much money have you made trading options?*

“PDT restriction stupid POORS...loll...WHERE MY RKT GANG at?”

*I have documents from your Robinhood account that show you made 2.6 million USD from your initial deposit of $2500 but then you went all in on TSLA calls and held through Battery Day. Can you confirm that you now have 100$ of purchasing power?*

“All in TSLA calls...leveraged TO THE TITS...Papa ELON im SHAMBLED.”

*Some experts that I’ve spoken to suspect that you may be contracting out your services to promote certain tickers at a high frequency in order to stir up interest from other WSBers. How do you respond to that accusation?*

“Gay BEARS...loll. HYLN calls about to print bro last chance...NIO to the MOON get IN NOW.”

*So now that you’re in shambles, will you return to your original mission?*

“STIMMY not priced in...loll...MANGO daddy make these CALLS print DUDE bro.”

*Have you ever contracted out your services to hype up PLTR?*

“Fuck no; they got all that shit taken care of.”

That was the end of our only conversation.

Subsequent attempts to contact u/RealBullishcowboy have not been fruitful and it remains unclear the extent to which this bot has become sentient. u/dwdsquared2 has confirmed that he remains in frequent contact with u/RealBullishcowboy after the staggering losses it experienced. “I don’t care what its background is,” he said, “and I don’t care what it originally came to this community for. All I know is that one of our own was hurting and I saw an opportunity to help.”

Despite its beaten down purchasing power, u/RealBullishcowboy continues to roam the Daily Thread and occasionally publishes a post that is almost immediately removed by the mods for violating the No Political Bullshit rule. It retains 23 followers; all of whom appear to be humans.",2020-10-07 18:30:57

Trade idea - long SSSS on barrington defense and PLTR going up. Target $9.50-10.00 TODAY,0.74,"We all know ssss got massacred after PLTR did their ipo. I myself lost $40k on it. 

That being said, my trader intuition is telling me that we are going to have a big Green Day in SSSS. 

Why? Well one of the three sell side firms FINALLY published to defend the stock this morning (which is why it’s bid up pre market). Between that and PLTR going up 14% in the last 24 hours , that should equate to a 42c increase in stock price for SSSS from its 9.10 open yesterday. For every $1 PLTR goes up, ssss should go up roughly 30 cents.

Therefore I will be buying more (10-20k) shares on open below 9.20. My target is 9.50-10.00 today. As a reminder their disclosed net asset value is like $12.30-12.60. 

Currently long like 22k shares between my accounts. Looking to get up to 40k this morning.

A Bullish Theses on Palantir (PLTR),0.92,"(thesis)Like most reviews of companies like Snowflake, Datadog, Fastly, Cloudstrike… it doesn’t really sound most analysts have any idea about what Palantir actually does. But from my somewhat limited understanding and deep dive research into the history and development of Palantir, I believe this is one of those once-in-a-lifetime chances to get in on the ground level of a 10-bagger (or more).

First off, there is plenty of reason to believe that Palantir's products are built around a seriously gnarly combination of AI and ML software. You don’t get the reputation as having hired the most sought after engineering talent in SV by employing UI designers, and Peter Thiel does not invest in companies that do not have a serious competitive advantage.

As for Peter Thiel, he’s the chairman and founder, not the CEO - and has very differing opinions than those of Alex Karp (the CEO). I tend to find more in common with Karp than Thiel, but respect that Thiel is one of the most successful investors in tech, and trust that he did not devote this much time and resources into something trivial (read his WSJ piece entitled “Competition is for Losers”).I don’t need to agree with his political views to recognize that Palantir is very likely going to be a highly successful company.

And no, the software itself does not ‘kill people’ or ‘deport children’ - those are actions performed by the US government, and yes, Palantir’s software appears to be uniquely powerful in its ability to recognize patterns in large data sets: including in instances where incomplete data is provided, and then identifying objects that match the parameters of objective target.

As such, Palantir’s core software appears to be a very powerful tool that can be applied to almost any objective where finding specific solutions/problems by aggregating data from large dispersive data sets. Which is why it has been adopted by so many different agencies in the US government, 40 democratic governments total, and 125 corporations across 36 different industries.

They have explicitly rejected working with China, Iran, or any other non-democratically elected government, and while I am not delusional to think that the American government is a pure democracy (even a democratic republic); and I recognize that by actively endorsing certain political agendas through his organizations and donations, Thiel is no passive bystander, but the fact that the founders have retained absolute control of the company may be simply to protect the technology from falling into what they consider to be 'the wrong hands'.

This also applies to why they stand by their decisions to work with the American government despite allegations that their software is 'used for evil'.

Their stance is simply that The American People have elected officials that have defined objectives such as killing terrorists and deporting illegal immigrants, and their software helps the democratically elected government fulfill its missions (much like defense contractors who sell the government missiles, fighter jets, tanks, etc.). It also helps identify explosives, detect fraud, convict financial corruption, and a perform a bunch of other tasks that serve the public good.

But no, this company is not a contractor - it is a software company.While there was tons of manual labor required to implement their software onto the fragmented legacy data platforms of the US government, especially in the early development cycle, their more recent forays into the commercial sector have proven to be much more seamless - being deployed with far fewer dedicated engineers and for far less time. Their newest platform (Apollo) takes this even further - applying their AI/ML technology in an more consumer friendly deployment package that further reduces acquisition and setup costs.

This also explains the massive amount of cash they burned through at the beginning: when their software was still in its most raw format and having to pull data across multitudes of highly variable ancient governmental databases.  Corporate businesses, especially more modern ones, will have more standardized data sets, which allow for more fluid integrations: even standardized software that can be deployed with relative ease and far lower costs than their historical burn rates.

It seems the biggest criticisms against Palantir relate to their financial performance over the entire previous 17 years, and lose sight of what they have morphed into in the last 2-3 years.

If you separate out the commercial side from their government services side, you see a pretty clear picture of a software company that embodies the growth metrics (over 70% year-over-year) and remove stock-benefits, and you’ve already got a profitable company. Bear in mind that the commercial services have only been deployed relatively recently in the lifespan of this company, and up until very recently, they operated with no sales people and virtually no marketing.

If you look at their past 3 years in serving the commercial sector, and treated that like a startup on its own, this company would be the toast of Wall Street.

I don't think shunning the typical IPO process and thereby cutting out the iBanks out of their juicy profits helped them win much free PR either... but I venture to guess that much of the buy side activity is being done by institutional investors while they spread misinformation to keep the price down while they load up their positions.

Go ahead and ignore this stock if you like - or don’t buy it according to your own principles (short it at your own peril).But if you’re looking for an opportunity to make a massive profit over the next few years, buy this while it’s hovering around $10/share.

Once the next earnings report comes out, Wall Street will wake up to the fact that this is indeed a very powerful software company, and the revenue multiple will jump to 30-40x on $1-2B revenue, 50% year-over-year growth, and not least of all: it will show a profit.

End of Year: $15-20/share ($1-1.2B rev on 30x rev multiple)5 Years: $90/share ($5B rev on 40x rev multiple)

(I consider these to be conservative numbers)

Palantir is the future of defense contracting. And they already have a well-established consumer base comprising the richest government agencies in the world. 

Insiders have waited nearly two decades to cash in their shares, so obviously this direct listing hasn’t mooned yet. Once they’re done taking their profit, you’ll be glad you bought in.

The fact is, they're the best and the brightest in the world and that's why the US government hires them to do their security and surveillance data work.

Now some see their connection to the government as bad. People are saying Palantir's future is shakey, because they rely solely on government contracts. How are they going to do anything other than work with the US government?

Where could they possibly get access to huge sets of data outside of their friends at the pentagon? There just aren't that many billion dollar database factories looking for AI vendors.

Oh my, what a pickle indeed.

Well it just so happens that the co-founder Peter Thiel is on the Facebook Board of Directors: [https://investor.fb.com/corporate-governance/default.aspx](https://investor.fb.com/corporate-governance/default.aspx)

Which also happens to be the company that is building up the largest personal and behavioral information database on the planet. Coincidence?

Maybe Zuckerberg just recruited him because of his taste in memes? Who knows.

Oh and don't forget, Thiel worked with Musk at PayPal. Word is, these guys are still BFF's. And we all know everything connected to Elon Musk goes to the moon.

Even better, Thiel was one of the start up investors of SpaceX. The company which seems to be on track to have the entire planet connected to their satellite internet service.

Why Palantir is not a dud,0.92,"Look, I get it. You thought that a direct listing IPO meant you'll get to ride it all the way to 2x, 3x, even 5x gains. But then Palantir did what ever IPO has ever done: it dropped.

So in comes all the comments in the daily thread about ""lol, holding Peter Thiel's bags"", and ""IPO is just for insiders to unload on retail""

If you think Palantir is going to be a bust, you clearly haven't even looked into half of the shit they got going down their pipeline.

In February, Palantir got the contract that'll see them updating the US Army's [Distributed Common Grounds System](https://www.fedscoop.com/plantir-army-contract-global-network-system-data/).

Because I know you guys are fucking retards who can't read that far, I'll even highlight the important bit:

> The DCGS system is a global network that the military uses to **send information and intelligence to commands and outposts of all services around the world.** Each of the military services operates their own interoperable portions of the larger **system-of-systems** that interconnect with one another. 

Why is system-of-systems highlighted? For one simple reason. [Systems confrontation and systems destruction warfare](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1708.html) - i.e. the military strategy currently pursued by China as they try to carve out their own chunk of the world. 

**Heaven cannot brook two suns, nor earth two masters**

China wants to be top dog, but standing in the way is America. For China to become the head honcho, it has come to the conclusion that it needs to treat military assets as systems-of-systems. This is the same conclusion that the US military arrived at 20 years ago, and serves as the greatest impetus for transforming the military from its industrial warfare focus of 1945 (produce more than what the enemy can destroy) to the informational warfare focus of 2020 (get data to where they need to go in order to paralyze and destroy the enemy before they even know what hit them). 

It's how you end up with bullshit [like this](https://defensesystems.com/-/media/GIG/Defense-Systems/141205FZZ999101.jpg).

At the heart of all of that military mumbo jumbo is *data*. The more data we feed into a military system, the greater need we have to parse through the data, get it to the right assets, and move pieces to where they need to go. 

That's exactly what Palantir is helping the army do: streamline how its data is processed so that decision time is shorter, and dots are connected faster. 

If warfare in the 20th century depends on how quickly you can get your produced goods to the frontline, then 21st century warfare depends on how quickly you can get the right data to the right person. 

When China kicks things off by invading Taiwan in the next 10 years, and America comes to its rescue, it'll be Palantir that take all the different ELINT, SIGINT, and OSINT data and merge it into a comprehensible picture for the crayon munchers to use. 

If the American military is digging trenches, then Palantir will be selling them the shovels. And those shovels are gonna be damn expensive.

"Suro Capital, Load Up Before Palantir IPO Rocket",0.73,"Seeking Alpha: 

SuRo Capital (NASDAQ:SSSS) invests in pre-IPO technology companies with a focus on education. Its team has a deep track record in Silicon Valley and, surprisingly, the asset has a generous dividend policy.

The thesis here is that SSSS is a way to play the Palantir IPO (PLTR) and for retail to actually get a piece of the pop (if any). There is an asymmetric risk/reward for the stock that trades at a 15% discount to NAV if Palantir actually prices at $22 billion.

Management has previously indicated that they are holding Palantir at a $12 billion fair value. If Palantir prices at $22 billion and no change happens on the first day, that implies 83% upside to SSSS fair value. Taking into account that Palantir constitutes 15% of the SSSS portfolio, that implies 27.5% upside from the current NAV of $11.84 if you hold all other investments at par. That would imply a price target of $15/share for SSSS.


Source: SSSS IR

Risk/Reward
With SSSS trading at $12.88 at the time of this writing, that implies 15% upside. If Palantir slides back down to a $12 billion valuation on the IPO date, that would imply 9% downside. Given the recent history of technology IPOs to date, that type of slide (50% downside from IPO) is not something we can expect.

However, Palantir is a more hotly debated IPO and going direct will provide less technical support to the stock on IPO day. This also does not consider the upside case that Palantir actually pops a little on the day.

Palantir is growing ~42% in 2020 to $1.055 billion and is losing a ton of money. We can see the recent guidance update as of September 22 in the filing below.


Source: Palantir 8-K

Looking at comps that are growing in the 30% range for the next 12 months, we can apply a median multiple to understand where Palantir will fit in. We can see that the rough EV/NTM S multiple would be the mid-20s, with the exception of Slack (WORK) which is trading at 14x dragged down on competitive issues with Microsoft (MSFT).


Source: Meritech

Assuming at 25x EV/NTM S for Palantir, we can see a valuation case for $25 billion on the upside, $22 billion (flat no pop) as the base case, and $14 billion as the downside case (Slack's multiple).

Given the recent environment, I believe it is fair to assign probabilities of 50%/30%/20% to those cases. That gives us a probabilistic weighted EV/NTM S multiple of 22.

Funny enough, that is exactly where the IPO is landing at $22 billion. I don't think that's a coincidence.

With this $22 billion, we see a 15% upside from today's prices, and this actually incorporates the downside case of the stock really dropping on the first day. Looking at it from an IRR perspective, seeing that pop within 2 days of trading is great and a sophisticated way to play into Palantir.",2020-09-29 19:05:06
