Energy Department Releases its Hydrogen Program Plan
Today, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) released its Hydrogen Program Plan to provide a strategic framework for the Department&#39;s hydrogen research, development, and demonstration (RD&amp;D) activities.
The DOE Hydrogen Program is a coordinated Departmental effort to advance the affordable production, transport, storage, and use of hydrogen across different sectors of the economy. The Plan involves participation from the Offices of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Fossil Energy, Nuclear Energy, Electricity, Science, and the Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy.
&quot;Hydrogen is an exciting fuel source that has the potential to integrate our nation&#39;s energy resources, but to fully recognize its potential across the economy, we need to lower costs and see a significant increase in hydrogen supply and demand,&quot; said U.S. Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette.",2020-11-12T20:55:00Z,3613,

"@Fredflowers323 the only controversy $FCEL needs to dip randomly for no reason at all is that tomorrow is a Wednesday and we&#39;ve had a two day spike.

But then you need to factor in the price of beans. I don&#39;t know about you, but looking at the overall situation, a can of Bush&#39;s Baked beans costs more than it did at the beginning of this year. That may not seem like much, but when you factor in the general cost basis of beans vs stocks, that leave a few fractional shares of FCEL on the table. Times that by the total population of the us buying beans vs stocks, and you can correlate it to the per capita amount  of beans vs shares purchased to the tune of approximately 1.4 million shares that WONT be purchased tomorrow.

"$FCEL $PLUG $SRNE I&#39;ve been listening to warrior trading a bit and learning a lot.  Some things he says really resonate and echo some of the best traders I know like &quot;trade to a plan&quot; and &quot;know your line in the sand&quot;  Many of you know exactly who I&#39;m referring to.

As I was driving this morning it occurred to me that we are motivated by fear and control of that fear is essential.   We are afraid of being average so we trade.  We are afraid of the stock getting away from us and we don&#39;t sell.  We are afraid of it continuing to fall and we don&#39;t buy.  We are so afraid we often do the opposite of what we should be doing...the paradox of trading.

There&#39;s another speaker I listen too and he speaks about using fear and placing it behind us to motivate us forward instead of in front of us...preventing us from making decisions and taking action.  

Investing in stocks is worthless if you&#39;re not investing in knowing yourself and realizing your potential is still yet to be fully tapped.

"$FCEL   For the last few months these shares have been traveling through a lateral channel with support and resistance lines near $2 and $3. That’s the bracket I’d normally use to sell options but since these shares are so inexpensive and the channel is so wide I’ve been selling short straddles at $2.50. That’s provided more premium but it’s also put me in or taken me out of positions on a regular basis. It’s also provided additional funds so I could additionally swing trade the shares along the channel. I point this out because the shares are back near $2 again.

"$FCEL The reality is @hustlebut, that you have had numerous opportunities to trade your way to a better position.  If you had done nothing but sell calls on your position,  you would be making a nice return.   

Thats how I learned to trade calls when FCEL was .30 and BK was like 105%  I bought shares for .34 each and sold the longest dated $1 for .10ea.  I figured that was a 30% reduction in my exposure and at the time, if FCEL hit $1, I was willing to sell.  

On the flip side,  if FCEL did go BK and took 2 years to come out of it, the 30% options premium represented a 15% annualized return on my money which is pretty good! So I managed my risk from the gate. 

Do you think I didn&#39;t go through the same experience you are now w $PLUG at 2.30 dropping to $1.80. It sucked but man I wish I bought more shares. 

Do you think the people who bought Plug b4 crash at $5 are crying now? It dropped to high $2.",2020-10-20T10:44:55Z,13665,
"$FCEL Hustlebut, for all you whining and crying,  life is about perspective.   For someone who bought shares at .26 and sold $2.50 calls on the JPM  run for .50, this is an awesome stock!  For someone who bought a second set of shares as a trade at $2.41, sold Oct $2.50 calls for .21 on their old shares to execute the trade,  then seeing Oct was going to expire wrote Nov calls for .48 on the remaining shares....beautiful.  I&#39;ll keep righting calls until I sell those shares for. 09 more than I paid and in the process,  I might just double my money.  

You&#39;re never going to amount to much if you keep crying about how it&#39;s the pumper  fault, or #nonewsfew fault.  No one forced you to buy.

I was looking to go long term on FCEL, but I did some in-depth time analysis.  The major time alignment for FCEL if they are still around I’d in the the last 4 months of 2022 or the first 4 months of 2023.  You’ll have your rallies inbetween but the health growth starts in 2023, if it’s still around with cash flow to keep it going.

Sorry to burst your bubble, but FCEL is as FCEL always has been. For the record, I have only ever traded FCEL long between 2008-2012 and then only ever day traded it since 2015 with its first of two R/Ss and still to this day with each crash after each new 52-week high. As long as FCEL persists in thriving with warrants rather than its products and services, what with revenues one quarter what they were in 2012,  I will never again trust it as I once did.",2020-09-30T17:17:27Z,52,

Then the tied hot dogs up in the tree just above him....and rounded up every dog in the neighborhood to try and get the hot dogs 🤣 I&#39;ve no doubt if those ladies could get their hands on that little wanker  (who&#39;s only trying to lower his $2.65 average)  they&#39;d do the same thing to him.
