Energy Department Releases its Hydrogen Program Plan
Today, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) released its Hydrogen Program Plan to provide a strategic framework for the Department&#39;s hydrogen research, development, and demonstration (RD&amp;D) activities.
The DOE Hydrogen Program is a coordinated Departmental effort to advance the affordable production, transport, storage, and use of hydrogen across different sectors of the economy. The Plan involves participation from the Offices of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Fossil Energy, Nuclear Energy, Electricity, Science, and the Advanced Research Projects Agency‚ÄìEnergy.
&quot;Hydrogen is an exciting fuel source that has the potential to integrate our nation&#39;s energy resources, but to fully recognize its potential across the economy, we need to lower costs and see a significant increase in hydrogen supply and demand,&quot; said U.S. Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette.",2020-11-12T20:55:00Z,3613,

That may not seem like much, but when you factor in the general cost basis of beans vs stocks, that leave a few fractional shares of FCEL on the table.

"$FCEL $PLUG $SRNE I&#39;ve been listening to warrior trading a bit and learning a lot.  Some things he says really resonate and echo some of the best traders I know like &quot;trade to a plan&quot; and &quot;know your line in the sand&quot;  Many of you know exactly who I&#39;m referring to.

As I was driving this morning it occurred to me that we are motivated by fear and control of that fear is essential.   We are afraid of being average so we trade.  We are afraid of the stock getting away from us and we don&#39;t sell.  We are afraid of it continuing to fall and we don&#39;t buy.  We are so afraid we often do the opposite of what we should be doing...the paradox of trading.

There&#39;s another speaker I listen too and he speaks about using fear and placing it behind us to motivate us forward instead of in front of us...preventing us from making decisions and taking action.  

Investing in stocks is worthless if you&#39;re not investing in knowing yourself and realizing your potential is still yet to be fully tapped.

"$FCEL   For the last few months these shares have been traveling through a lateral channel with support and resistance lines near $2 and $3. That‚Äôs the bracket I‚Äôd normally use to sell options but since these shares are so inexpensive and the channel is so wide I‚Äôve been selling short straddles at $2.50. That‚Äôs provided more premium but it‚Äôs also put me in or taken me out of positions on a regular basis.

"$FCEL @Hustlebut , all I can say is learn how to trade and take responsibility for YOUR decisions.   If stocks are to much for you to stomach maybe you should ask about around the board if someone can recommend a high yield CD for you.  

In the meantime,  here&#39;s a little recommended reading or listen.",2020-10-20T10:46:59Z,13665,
"$FCEL The reality is @hustlebut, that you have had numerous opportunities to trade your way to a better position.  If you had done nothing but sell calls on your position,  you would be making a nice return.   

Thats how I learned to trade calls when FCEL was .30 and BK was like 105%  I bought shares for .34 each and sold the longest dated $1 for .10ea.  I figured that was a 30% reduction in my exposure and at the time, if FCEL hit $1, I was willing to sell.  

On the flip side,  if FCEL did go BK and took 2 years to come out of it, the 30% options premium represented a 15% annualized return on my money which is pretty good! So I managed my risk from the gate. 

Do you think I didn&#39;t go through the same experience you are now w $PLUG at 2.30 dropping to $1.80. It sucked but man I wish I bought more shares. 

Do you think the people who bought Plug b4 crash at $5 are crying now? It dropped to high $2.",2020-10-20T10:44:55Z,13665,
"$FCEL Hustlebut, for all you whining and crying,  life is about perspective.   For someone who bought shares at .26 and sold $2.50 calls on the JPM  run for .50, this is an awesome stock!  For someone who bought a second set of shares as a trade at $2.41, sold Oct $2.50 calls for .21 on their old shares to execute the trade,  then seeing Oct was going to expire wrote Nov calls for .48 on the remaining shares....beautiful.  I&#39;ll keep righting calls until I sell those shares for. 09 more than I paid and in the process,  I might just double my money.  

You&#39;re never going to amount to much if you keep crying about how it&#39;s the pumper  fault, or #nonewsfew fault.  No one forced you to buy.  Many of us see a bullish case for FCEL and we believe in and have weathered far more daunting swings than you for far longer.  It is risky. Thats why you bought isn&#39;t it? High risk...High reward.

"$FCEL @dennismccain If you have been following FCEL for the last 12 years as I have, you would know that this is only a gift for those shorting the stock, not the longs. Are you at least aware that in 2019-2020 on its way to rocketing 22x to $3, FCEL on two occasions crashed to $1 before rebounding for another triple to $3.40? With this latest secondary announcement, a most hated event, and with certain dilution, FCEL could very well crash to $1 once more, and then and only then will it be a gift for long term holders. Sorry to burst your bubble, but FCEL is as FCEL always has been. For the record, I have only ever traded FCEL long between 2008-2012 and then only ever day traded it since 2015 with its first of two R/Ss and still to this day with each crash after each new 52-week high. As long as FCEL persists in thriving with warrants rather than its products and services, what with revenues one quarter what they were in 2012,  I will never again trust it as I once did.",2020-09-30T17:17:27Z,52,
