$GM & $F are jokes.,0.53,"Ford and General Motors are jokes. People in wall street are going crazy because these two stocks are years behind in EV's, the Microsoft deal is somewhat good news but using AI for cars takes experience and lots of data. I'm big on EV stocks and growth stocks, it doesn't take that much to impress me as long as there's potential and see proof.  GM and Ford are making EVs that have expensive old inefficient batteries and no software to make the motors independent to make them more efficient, they have no charging infrastructure and terrible milage. I'm more likely to put my money in $GOEV, $NIO, and Lucid motors when they're public. Startups have to innovate to stay alive, big carmakers have to put out a joke car so their investors think they will do something. Tesla has shown their innovators even while having the largest market cap and only delivering 500k cars a year. Telsa has the leg up in every sector but manufacturing power, which will change very soon. They have better software, better Machine learning, they have more EVs on the road giving their AI more data which makes it way better, their car efficiency is much better and they know how to make an EV  (now). They have better design and engineering, Ford and GM have a few cars combined Tesla has 4 out right now and 3 more on the way.  Ford and Gm even show that they are dependent on startups, remember GM and $NKLA instead of developing their own cars because they're too lazy they try buying a truck company that was public for a few months and no real working trucks.  Rivian and Ford not much more to say. Rivian is good but under funding from a joke car company, they will buy Rivian cut corners to make an easy cheap car. Ford and Gm arent innovators, you want a big car company that is somewhat serious good luck their plan is to buy a start-up.  Everyone wants TSLA to go to them, china loves tesla and they usually hate American companies that should prove how much countries want EV makers. The whole point is GM and F are jokes they got so used to making the same car and not needing anything they forgot how to innovate and bring change. VW their liars they can't even make a good ICE car how do you expect them to make a clean energy car without making an ICE emission problem almost no other carmakers have. You may see I'm a hardcore Tesla bull. You want 3 real cars $NIO and $TSLA and Lucid motors. You don't like Evs then GME and PLTR.  üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ. you can't make a car company into a high tech car company, you can't make a high tech company into a car company. they have to be one company, not a partnership.

üöÄTSM World Domination: Beyond the moon.,0.8,"Don‚Äôt call me crazy yet, let me explain.

If you‚Äôve been on this subreddit or know anything about meme stocks, you know about the stocks that have skyrocketed recently. GME, AMD, PLTR, AAPL, TSLA, NVIDIA, CRSR, etc. 

There is a stock that almost all the big tech companies, EV companies, and meme stocks had in common. TSM

If you don‚Äôt know what TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing) makes computer chips. You definitely own at least one TSM chip, whether you know it or not. 

Here is a list of a few of the companies that manufacture their chips with TSMC: (from [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20leading%20fabless%20semiconductor%20companies%20such,such%20as%20Allwinner%20Technology%2C%20HiSilicon%2C%20Spectra7%2C%20and%20Spreadtrum.))

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Apple Inc., Nvidia, Intel, Qualcomm, Xilinx,  Altera,Texas Instruments. 

It would take me years to research every single product that TSMC manufactures, but here are a few of the most significant ones that I found:


AMD:All AMD chips are manufactured by TSM any reason to buy AMD is also a reason to buyTSM 
   AMD CPU‚Äôs: This also includes AMD Ryzen Processors which are the most bought CPUS on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computers-Accessories-Computer-CPU-Processors/zgbs/pc/229189) As well as the processors that go into many laptops. 
   AMD Graphics Cards: Apple uses AMD Graphics card in their Mac products. They are also in many windows PC‚Äôs and laptops, and they are used by miners. 
   Xbox/PlayStation Internals: The PS5 and Xbox Series both use AMD CPU‚Äôs and Graphics, which are manufactured by TSM. 

Apple: Apple manufactures All of its processors at TSM. TSM made chips are in every iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, Air Pod, etc. the new M1 Apple in house silicon Macs are also made by TSM. 

Nvidia: Nvidia is the world largest GPU company. They also make self driving processors for Tesla, Nio and other companies. 

Qualcomm: Qualcomm makes Arm processors. Qualcomm processors power everything from Samsung phones to smart TV‚Äôs to Amazon Alexa. 

Xilinx: they make most of the 5G processors that go in towers and phones. Samsung Phones use Xilix cellular chips. 

Texas Instruments: they make your fucking calculator. 

There are many many more companies that TSM manufactures chips for. They are also on a more advanced process mode than any other company in the world. Do some of your own research and find out what other products TSM makes. 

See how many products in your life are powered by TSM. 

Chances are, A TSM manufactured chip could be inside your phone, your computer, your TV, your smart speaker and other smart home devices, your wifi router, your cars radio/gps, your cars self driving system (if your car has it). Your wireless headphones, the cell tower in your neighborhood. Even your calculator.

The ‚Äúcloud‚Äù is also powered by TSM. The servers that google, Amazon, one drive, Spotify, Palantir, etc. 

If you can find just one area of technology that does not, at some point, use TSM manufacturing, comment it below. 

If you can‚Äôt then buy some fucking shares. üöÄüöÄüöÄ",2021-01-22 17:08:29

GME SHARES PURCHASED

First, forgive me for my cowardice. I should have joined you earlier but I was afraid. I am new to this. In time I hope to grow massive balls like you lot.

I also want to thank citron and andrew cleft. After yesterday‚Äôs ‚Äòlive stream‚Äô I felt he lacked conviction in his belief, this was evident in the way he spoke. A lot of Ah‚Äôs and Um‚Äôs, complete lack of charisma and confidence. Subjective but still. That and he did say some stupid things like issuing more shares to pay down debt. Which generally you don‚Äôt do (but can). He shouldn't be giving management advice if his goal is to short a share. The most important thing is this, conviction and faith. Have that, which he, and to point I lacked. Already you have seen people who had the balls to jump in make gainz.  Also as u/An_EliteMind_Ihope pointed out, citron is clearly lying, thank you for sharing this friend. 

Also want to thank u/DeepFuckingValue for his hard work. If I miss anybody I apologize. I usually lurk here.

The other thing I want to share is for anyone that was afraid to invest. A few days ago I sold about 814 shares of Nio and realized a gain of about $41,901. I apologize for the proof.

https://imgur.com/a/VFryR9L

Here in Canada half of that is taxable so $20,950. I originally sold to buy BB and PLTR. I still have positions in NIO, I do believe in it and I like how the company is being managed. However, I also purchased GME. The point is this if I get a loss I can net that against my gains. I‚Äôd rather make more money than pay my incompetent government taxes.  Since it is the beginning of 2021 I won‚Äôt have to pay taxes till like May or April of 2022. It also gives me a whole year to sit on this and realize those gains/losses when I need to. Plenty of time to get my shit in order. At the same time, you don‚Äôt have to sell. If you get a loss eventually any other position might gain that allows you to plan things out long term. If these companies are doing things you like ride it out. Ride to die. Don‚Äôt be a coward. As you have seen others have sold on  poisitions to diversify too.  Just some incentive for you folks. Now I am in Canada, and I am sure the US has similar tax rules. 

That is all I really wanted to say. This last bit is personal. I know I have bugged some of you guy‚Äôs for guidance and advice. I want to throw this out there. I do want to get into options trading or learn how to do analysis like you guys. I have somewhat learned by reading these threads and studying independently. I don‚Äôt care about being rich, I just hate being a loser in my 30‚Äôs. I am the son of immigrants, and all I have wanted to do is provide for and take care of my family. I want you to understand that so if you have some guidance or knowledge that has helped you please please dm me. That is all.",2021-01-22 14:47:33
Let me Tell yall why i choose XPENG > NIO,0.59,"now NIO may have more CCP backing than XPENG but let it be clear that not only BABA backs XPENG, but also chinese banks have credited $2 billion to XPENG. They both have almost identical growth in sales from 2019 to 2020 however Xpeng sold about 1000 more vehicles in 2020. They both are working towards self driving and autonomous driving but it seems that xpeng is making much more progress. 

NIO market cap: $90+ billion
XPENG market cap: $42 billion

I offer no financial advice but my own reasoning for why i choose XPENG > NIO

Gamma Watch of Popular Tickers 1-20-2021 Roundup,0.87,"Due to the growing size of the sub, we've been causing more gamma squeeze events on stocks - GME last week, BB Monday.

Gamma is an option term. What it means in this context is the amount of stock someone short the options would need to buy or sell to hedge their position as price moves.

For WSB popular stocks, I believe that about 2/3 - 3/4 of all options were sold by dealers to you degenerates, which means that the dealer is now ""short gamma"", which is not a superhero movie involving dwarves.

That means that as prices move, dealers have to madly buy or sell stocks in the direction of the price movement so as not to lose money, because option dealers/market makers ALWAYS win (almost). This means that in some situations, moving over a ""gamma ramp"" (price where there's a lot of gamma) may be many times easier than in areas without a lot of gamma. This in turn makes a ""gamma squeeze"" where dealers are forced to buy or sell stock so as to not lose money (similar to short squeeze, which is when shorts are forced to buy, causing yet more buying, so as to not lose more money).

In most cases, gamma is not a meaningful effect on a stock, close to zero. But it can be a big deal. In BB's case, I think as much as 2/3 of the stock bought on Monday was dealers, and the weak rally today is evidence of that - no gamma ramp. GME is similar - passed a huge gamma ramp to get to the 30s last week (with dealers doing 2/3 of the buying), now kind of in between several gamma ramps, with dead zones 36-38 and 31-34.

Looking at gamma can help you guys understand what price actions are possible. It's a giant lever that can go against you or for you. If price is slightly above a gamma ramp, it's bearish because small amounts of selling can crash the price quickly. If the price is slightly below a gamma ramp, it's bullish, because small buying can cause the price to run up the ramp, while your downside is insulated by little forced selling by the dealers.

Note that when you buy NEW options from dealers, they just do the trade you do initially - buy a put, they sell stock. Buy a call, they buy stock. But from there, price moves cause them to match the stock price movement - they remove some of their short when price goes up and they sold you a put, and they enlarge their long when the price goes up and they sold you a call. Make sense? Thought not, work on your reading comprehension guys if you are trading complex derivatives with your life savings.

Keep in mind that in a lot of cases, there's no meaningful gamma, and no price action will occur.

I prepared today gamma outlooks on some of the most mentioned stocks - GME, BB, PLTR, ICLN,TSLA TLRY, NIO. Note that this tool ([http://www.tradingvolatility.net/](http://www.tradingvolatility.net/)) assumes that calls are long gamma for dealers, and puts are short gamma. I think when you guys engage a stock, it's more like 3/4 of all gamma is short gamma, put or call.  Thetagang shows up and gives them some long gamma.

Current popular stock gamma landscapes (IMGUR has been a bit wonky lately... hopefully its loading):

[https://imgur.com/a/1IrWNln](https://imgur.com/a/1IrWNln)

Gamma is only relevant relative to float. Big gamma matters more on small stocks. You will form your own opinions and trade accordingly, and if this sub lately is any indication, you'll read ALL information as UBER BULLISH for the stock you YOLOed on. But here are my interpretations coldly reading the data:

**GME** **üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

Relevance: Very high - Big swings could cause MM's to buy/sell 1/3 of floating shares easily.

Reading: Somewhat bearish with bearish trend especially right above $40, but possibility of strong bull case on good bid. There is a LOT of gamma ramp, and looking at the picture, we are more 'on top' of the gamma than ""on bottom"" of the gamma. It turns out that the bears favor the ""on top"" position w/ regards to gamma. People have added a lot of bearish bets in the past few days in the form of puts under this price, which are fuel for the fire down, and can be seen in the graph as put positions. A lot more gamma ramp on net below than above. Bulls should be secure if this stock can get to the low 40s and stay there. If it starts moving down, it will run fast and then slow down at 36/37, then slow down again at 31/32/33.  Good news is that because of all this new put vol, the price action will be less naturally down in the base case as dealers dump their hedges as time goes forward, pushing price up gradually.

**BB** **üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

Relevance: High. Big swings could cause MMs to buy/sell 1/3 of floating shares.

Reading: Bearish, with bullish trend. This was arguably bearish yesterday because we were at the top of a ramp. Since then, peopl ehave establsihed a lot of new positions beginning to form a bullish ramp. Bad news can send this back to 10 quickly, but not much lower quickly. Accumulation of new calls should start to make moving up a possibility though if people keep buying.

**PLTR** **üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

Relevance: Moderate. Float is theoretically a billion shares, and swings could make MMs buy/sell perhaps 1/4 to 1/5 of that.

Reading: Slightly bullish. There's a sharp ramp down, but also up.. and  a strong buying trend will move this up, and there's large block of gamma at $30.

**ICLN:** **üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

Relevance: Low. Why? Because this is an ETF that can be made/destroyed by issuer on demand.

Reading: Actually a little bullish. This is so much gamma ahead of price that it will cause a couple hundred million dollars of clean energy buying on a decent day. I know, weird?

**TSLA:** **üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

As usual a gamma monster, hard to read. 750m float shares.

Relevance: Lowish. Not that much gamma compared to float.

Reading: Bullish. Most of the gamma is above current price.

**TLRY:** **üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

Huge OI on this one. 136m shares avail. Nearby gamma is something like 50m.

Relevance: High to very high. Maybe 1/3 or shares could turnover in some situations.

Reading: A bit bullish. Kind of in the middle of it all. Stock could move up fast on good buying pressure and get to low 20s on gamma.

**NIO:** **üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

Relevance:  Moderate to ""almost moderate"". It's something like 20% of float near price in hedging obligations in aggressive cases.

Reading: Bullish. Gamma mostly above current price.

&#x200B;

**My relevant positions:**

No positions on most of these.

Short GME on puts.

Long term holder of TSLA shares **üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

Long BBBY on calls, but didn't do the gamma chart of it here. It's at the bottom of a gamma ramp: **üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

"VSTO - Ammo Price to the Moon, Safe Easy 2-4 bagger",0.88,"While we wait for PLTR to break out of its wedge between 20-30, I wanted to showcase a company with some very strong near-term catalyst coming.

Vista Outdoor is the largest ammo maker in America with the acquisition of Remington's ammunition. As some of you know, ammo prices have gone exponential over the past year, with ammo prices going up 2-3x in some cases and continuing to climb higher.  Currently about 60% of VSTOs revenue is driven by ammunition, they own Federal, American Eagle, Remington (acquired in Nov) and Speer. VSTO currently has about 40% of the entire US ammunition market. Of the other major players, Hornady is private and Winchester is a smaller business segment of Olin.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sjw0cwkg8fc61.png?width=831&format=png&auto=webp&s=477744759d8941e9b2b1b693ec0c800ef0af24fb

So why does this matter? VSO share price had been falling since 2016 because of the Trump win in 2016, as a result, pricing on ammo and firearms dropped significantly from 2017-2019. This all changed with Covid-19 and the election of Joe Biden. While there is no data on firearms sales due to prohibition on a national registry for firearms, background checks serves as a good correlation for the number of guns sold as the majority of gun sales go through a background check. The number is up 60% YOY in 2020 from 2019. The FBI completed 39.7 million background checks in 2020, this means at least 40 million guns were sold in 2020 (it could be higher as you could buy two guns with one background check).

https://preview.redd.it/c1izzcvkafc61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=69ef284674000d6b7a477e1fdc11c69e6847f0c0

This has led to unprecedented demand for ammo. Ammo demand increased by 150% alone just in H1 2020

[https://www.nssf.org/first-time-gun-buyers-grow-to-nearly-5-million-in-2020/?hilite=%27139%27%2C%27percent%27%2C%27ammunition%27](https://www.nssf.org/first-time-gun-buyers-grow-to-nearly-5-million-in-2020/?hilite=%27139%27%2C%27percent%27%2C%27ammunition%27)

Due to massive shortages, ammo prices have literally been shooting up to the moon. For example, quality hallow-point 9mm ammo could be had for about USD0.35/round back in late 2019.

[https://www.sgammo.com/catalog/pistol-ammo-sale/9mm-luger-ammo](https://www.sgammo.com/catalog/pistol-ammo-sale/9mm-luger-ammo)

today, the same ammo costs upwards of USD1.4/round today, up nearly 4x in a year.

Manufacturers are facing unprecedented backorders. VSTO has mentioned in earning calls that they have USD1 billion in backorder for ammunition which would take 3-4 years to fill even if demand falls back to pre-covid levels. This means simply insane growth and margins that will come through over the next several years.

Now we get to valuations, the company is sitting on around 2.1-2.3 billion in normalized sales (about 60% from ammo), growing at 30% on a YoY basis which is still lagging because the Remington acquisition took place in November. Net Income for the company was USD60 million in the Sep quarter and is expected to be a blow-out in the Dec quarter, I am expecting somewhere around 80-100 million. If current trends hold for the next 4 quarters, the company will deliver around 400-500 million of Net Income. The company currently has a market cap of USD1.6 billion, which would give it a forward PE of 3x. During the Obama years, the stock was trading at 11x PE, and that was before you added about 8 million new gun owners, with more expected in the next 12 months.

This stock will easily be in the 40-50 in the next few months and 60-70 in a year and the Q4 earnings in Feb 4 will be a key catalyst.

Now lets talk about risks. People are obviously worried that there could be a ban on the sale of ammo. This would be shot down pretty quick by Scotus, I invite you to read Jackson v City of SF from the 9th Circuit Court (one of the least second amendment friendly lower courts)

[https://casetext.com/case/jackson-v-city-of-sf](https://casetext.com/case/jackson-v-city-of-sf)

""The Second Amendment protects ""arms,"" ""weapons,"" and ""firearms""; it does not explicitly protect ammunition. Nevertheless, without bullets, the right to bear arms would be meaningless. A regulation eliminating a person's ability to obtain or use ammunition could thereby make it impossible to use firearms for their core purpose.¬†*Cf.¬†Heller‚Ä¶.*(holding that ""the District's requirement (as applied to respondent's handgun) that firearms in the home be rendered and kept inoperable at all times ‚Ä¶ makes it impossible for citizens to use them for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional""). Thus ""the right to possess firearms for protection implies a corresponding right"" to obtain the bullets necessary to use them. *Cf.¬†Ezell‚Ä¶*(holding that the right to possess firearms implied a corresponding right to have access to firing ranges in order to train to be proficient with such firearms).""

As you can see, unless the democrats somehow stack SCOTUS and overturn Heller, ammunition is protected under the second amendment and will continue to be sold for the foreseeable future. Moreso, there are likely over 400 million firearms in America, that is a lot of ammunition (which is a consumable) which will likely be bought in the coming years for those firearms.

**Call Option on Chaos (Alternative to the VIX)**

So again, you guys are all convinced you'll make 10x from calls on GME, PLTR and BB so why bother with this stuff that's maybe a 2-4x. Well, we are all in the game of robots and momentum retail circle jerking each other (TSLA and NIO and we are hoping Palantir) and squeezing shorts (GME), this big bubble could come to a horrendous end if we start seeing real violence showing up in the streets.

Yes the right winged militias and antifa are just punching each other right now, marching around with rifles and plate carriers, and largely LARPING , but it doesn't take much for things to escalate. There are lots of Trump voters who feel like the election is stolen, and the body politics is getting more and more polarized. If a black swan event were to happen, expect ammo price to simply go even more vertical.

The real political VIX is in the price of ammo, and the largest maker of ammo is VSTO. I had been trying to come up with a way to find VIX proxies as rolling OTM VIX calls has a massive carry cost. I think VSTO is essentially a low carry/free VIX call right now, which allows you to take on more risks with other parts of your portfolio.

TLDR: start making bullet farmer memes.

I have about $100k in shares, about 10k in ITM Feb calls to play the earnings.

WallStreetBets Impact on the Market,0.97,"In 2020 retail-investor representation in the stock market surged by 4.7% to a record 19.6%. Spurred by zero-commission trading and COVID tailwinds, this booming segment of stock market traders has reshaped market behavior. 

I've been scraping discussion on WallStreetBets for several months, and tracking how often different tickers are mentioned every day.

The graph below visualizes yesterday's discussion on the forum. Size represents the number of times a ticker has been mentioned, whereas color brightness represents the performance of the stock. GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) had the highest discussion count with 495 mentions and returned 10.89% for the day.

&#x200B;

[WSB Heat Map](https://preview.redd.it/48jg1izvjic61.png?width=1119&format=png&auto=webp&s=089b824acc9dcd7f89689c71d661f0d127d164ee)

A quick look at the above graph shows that many of the companies listed have experienced parabolic stock growth and volatility over the last several months.¬†This begs the question: **Has WSB discussion been a leading indicator for stock performance?**

To test this question, I backtested a simple strategy that buys and holds the 5 stocks that were most discussed on WallStreetBets in the previous week. We ran this backtest using data from 2020.

The graph below shows the portfolio holdings by week (click for full-size image):

[WSB Portfolio Holdings](https://preview.redd.it/smkp7dualic61.png?width=1119&format=png&auto=webp&s=c95d1d4bbc1047a2c76b26fbfc3305143dc39d6d)

Tesla, Apple, AMD, Nio, and Microsoft were among the stocks that most frequently cracked the weekly top five most-mentioned tickers.

&#x200B;

[Most frequently held stocks](https://preview.redd.it/87r1vy9bkic61.png?width=1119&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffe1c8a89f6f603dd000223a4a26ee69402002fa)

Over the last year this simple strategy was up over 61%, with especially strong returns in the last quarter of 2020. The ""WallStreetBets Portfolio"" was more volatile than the S&P 500, but outperformed even during the downturn at the start of the year.

&#x200B;

[$WSB Performance](https://preview.redd.it/cc17jspglic61.png?width=1118&format=png&auto=webp&s=df61ec8ce1fc245a93cdb5fced42271e54f20de3)

To take a look at the relationship between WallStreetBets discussion and market activity at a stock-level, I‚Äôve picked a couple stocks that were among the most popular on WSB in the last 120 days and examined them to determine if there is a correlation between WSB discussion and share price and volume.

**Palantir Technologies Inc (NASDAQ: PLTR)**

Big data analytics company, Palantir Technologies Inc, had its highly anticipated IPO on September 30, 2020 trading at $8.20. Shortly after, on October 14, the discussion volume of PLTR tripled to nine counts as well as achieving a 4.65% gain on the day. WSB count and share price activity continue to share a positive correlation coefficient of 0.592 as the stock reached a 52-week high of 33.05 on November 27, 2020. *\[Note: A value of greater than 0.7 is considered a¬†strong correlation. Anything between 0.5 and 0.7 is a¬†moderate correlation, and anything less than¬†0.4¬†is considered a weak or no¬†correlation.\]*

&#x200B;

[Palantir Price vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/f8p41x1jkic61.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=2090f0fba5f9ee39cf7f3ed21932d31d6a0e1264)

WSB counts and PLTR volume for the same dates recorded a correlation coefficient of 0.803. This could indicate a large amount of individual-investor interest driving the recent valuation of Palantir which features a low proportion of institutional ownership at 14.41% (3Q20), compared to the industry average.

&#x200B;

[Palantir Volume vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/4qiik9ekkic61.png?width=1354&format=png&auto=webp&s=074100895bb7e99da71462126ed7f972d5763948)

PLTR received three downgrades from investment banks between October and December 2020 but added a price target increase to $30.00 (from $18.00) by Jeffries on January 11, 2021, well above its current price of $25.64. Risks still linger as 2Q20 to 3Q20 EBITDA losses increased by 83% to an $848.1m loss and, as of now, positive investor sentiment continues to support an uptrend.

**GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME)**

GameStop Corp. has experienced financial stress in recent years as the retail trends which had worked in its favor continue to decline globally. Total Liabilities climbed 12.18% to $2.26B from 2Q20 to 3Q20. Before May 5, 2020, WSB activity on GME had been dormant averaging 3.83 counts daily YTD.

Shortly following this, several threads on WSB began to speculate on a GME recovery due to increased gaming activity and a large existing short position of 57 million¬†shares at the time. WSB counts would be amplified after an investment from activist investor and founder of Chewy (NYSE: CHWY), Ryan Cohen.

Since May 5, 2020, GME has rallied 755.33% and WSB discussion counts averaged 55.34 a day making a positive correlation coefficient at 0.688.

&#x200B;

[GME Price vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/g8xj575nkic61.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b458e40d9866fbecbedc224b5679ba885463f5d)

The WSB counts and stock volume also shared a correlation coefficient of 0.628. This was exemplified on November 30, 2020, when stock volume spiked by 31.3m and discussion counts followed suit at 227 for the day.

&#x200B;

[GME Volume vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/3d3xn8dokic61.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=af618e9f2ea29d71d69d86dc1884a44ec42bbf24)

The mainly optimistic speculation of a GME recovery in May on WSB contrasted with most major media outlets at the time, which appeared to focus on store closures due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The rally and enthusiasm behind GME since that time was in stark contrast to many other corporations, 630 of which filed for bankruptcy in 2020 marking a 10 year high.

## Summary

There is no universal method of finding actionable insights when analyzing WSB, but discussion on the forum can serve as a useful estimation of retail interest. Companies that have had exponential growth with help from forums such as WSB are more likely to become transition to an organic growth phase with more institutional investors and less volume. Keeping an eye on rising companies on WSB could help identify an opportunity that many may have overlooked.",2021-01-20 16:36:28

**GM recently at CES showcased their vision to become a dominant EV player in this industry. They're going balls deep raw and betting everything on this clean energy future shit:**

* They announced a new division in GM called BrightDrop, where they'll produce electric vans for commercial delivery companies. Their first customer is FedEx and production will begin 2nd half of this year. This is not some fake ass partnership like with these other Spacs, it's the real fucking deal.
* GM CEO Mary Barra said they'll be investing $27 billion fucking tendies to develop EV's and automated technology over the next 5 years.
* GM said they expect to release 30 new EV models by 2025. I know some of you autistic fucks have reading comprehension problems, this mean WITHIN the next 5 years we'll get plenty of catalysts coming gradually.
* Their all-new modular platform and Ultium batteries: GM is partnering with LG Chem to make these low-cost and efficient batteries. Their expectations are up to 400 miles per charge with 0 to 60 in 3 seconds. They'll have energy ranges from 50 to more than 200kWh. Support for all-wheel applications. This gives them a shit ton of flexibility for a wide range of vehicles.
* GM's Ultium battery platform and powertrain is so great, that Japanese car manufacturer Honda has signed a deal with GM so they can build some of their EV's in the near future.
* Their first release EV is the newly designed Hummer which will come later this year. Lebron has been shilling it on his instagram

**GM has strong financials and an extremely undervalued valuation compared to their EV peers:**

* Their revenue last quarter was $35.47B, Tesla revenue was $8.77B, Nio revenue was $666 million. Put that into perspective relative to their valuations.
* GM already has solid cash flow, high-margins, a strong balance sheet. Which is a rarity compared to its EV competitors.
* GM is a cash cow and has the ability to outspend its competitors easily, while scaling quickly with their various number of factories.
* They'll be reinstating their dividend soon
* GM PE Ratio is 22.41, TSLA is 1,579.66, and others in the space even autistically higher

GM is not the next Tesla, but it has significant room to grow relative to its valuation as the company shifts to more EV future. It can quickly steal marketshare in the industry and scale fast to outpace their other competitors. GM is easily going over $70 and their options are dirt fucking cheap with great deltas.

TL;DR Blackberry/AWS IVY will be in every single vehicle produced after 2022. EV or ICE, self-driving or boomer driving, it doesn't fucking matter. It üöÄ will üöÄ be üöÄ in üöÄ every üöÄ single üöÄ one üöÄ Oh, and Blackberry QNX Neutrinos RTOS is fun too.

Before you start reading, I'd suggest grabbing a snack and a drink. Cause I'm about to drop a fucking novel.

You've probably heard Blackberry QNX a few times around other DDs but you're wondering wtf is it and who the hell is even using it. QNX is an Real Time Operating System (more on this later) meant for vehicles, and it's been around for a really long time. Currently there are at least 175m cars running around with QNX. As for what cars those are, I'll keep it short: Apple Car Play was developed on QNX.

So why haven't we heard more about Blackberry in recent years since there's so many QNX cars around? 2 reasons. 1: Dumbasses like you thought it was a phone company. 2: QNX is so ahead of the fucking game that boomer auto manufacturers like Ford and Mercedes were too stupid to use it effectively. For the last few years it's just been used to turn on your car's radio. *But things have changed now.*

**Zombie cars and QNX**

QNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. *What the fuck does that even mean nerd?* For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.

Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.

Fast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot *program* but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?

If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? [Li Auto](https://en.desaysv.com/index.php?id=4974) But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using [Nvidia](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/nvidia-announces-world-first-functionally-safe-ai-self-driving-platform) DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both [Canoo](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/blackberry-to-power-autonomy-systems-in-canoos-next-generation-electric-vehicles) and [Hyundai](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2019/hyundai-autron-selects-blackberry-qnx-to-power-next-generation-adas-and-autonomous-driving-software-platform) makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. *But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.*

You might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moonüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Linux is also an open source OS and this becomes a huge problem when we talk about zombie cars.

That's right. *Motherfucking zombie cars*. You know that scene in ""Fate of the Furious"" where Charlize Theron straight up just hacks all the cars in the city and starts slamming them into buildings? Yea, this is a legitimate fear of the U.S. government and Linux is not going to pass any safety regulations. And you better believe after SolarWind and FireEye hacks, Cybersecurity is the hottest topic right now when it comes to national security. You better believe the U.S. Government won't just allow open source OS flowing around millions of autonomous driving cars that can be hijacked at any time of day.

You know who does have MULTIPLE government certifications already though? Blackberry bb. I won't get it, but you can read [u/josh\_moworld](https://www.reddit.com/u/josh_moworld/)'s post right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/) to get a better idea Blackberry's history with the U.S. government and security.

The best part about it all is, Blackberry designed QNX to be 100% POSIX compliant. In dumbass terms it basically means any LINUX based program can be ported over easily. Come join the dark side, Elon.

Now that you're pretty much caught up to speed on QNX, let's move over to IVY and why I believe IVY will be Blackberry's return to the throne üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

**Blackberry x AWS IVY**

IVY is a co-development between Blackberry and Amazon and it is a 50/50 partnership. That's right; Jeff Bezos, the second richest man in the world and king of predatory business practices chose to partner with a company that has a $5.5b market cap. All hail, John Chen üëëüëëüëë

So what is IVY? Basically IVY cloud-based software that OEMs can install into their QNX vehicles (or any OS) and read sensor data from the vehicle's DCUs (domain controller units). These are basically sensors that give you data such as: times that you unlocked and locked your car, your car's wheel speed sensors, wiper arm sensors, tire pressure etc. In a Tesla, which is loaded with sensors, you will also see: sentry mode data, when an small object hits your car while parked, how hard you step on the accelerator, how hard you brake etc.

IVY basically captures this data and in real time sends it to OEMs for them to analyze. Cars are going to be fitted with more and more sensors (regardless of if they have autonomous systems or not) and the data that IVY provides is very helpful. This allows OEMs to see their customer's car preferences or driving styles and can further develop their future vehicles to match customer's interests. Also, since the data is transferred in REAL TIME, things like horrible weather conditions, traffic updates, and icy roads can be communicated to all vehicles within the OEM network so that people can be notified ahead of time.

But you know which industry would *love* this? Insurance companies. OEMs can gather all the safety data that IVY delivers and actually PROVE to insurance companies that their cars are safer. You know how Tesla had to come up with their own auto insurance? That was because Insurance companies were charging crazy high rates for Tesla's that had auto pilot. They didn't know exactly how to rate the risk, or who would take the blame. With Blackberry IVY, OEMs and insurance companies can partner together and have reliable data to work off of.

Best part of it all, IVY is extremely scalable and is a subscription based service. There isn't an exact price announced yet, but you know if Jeff Bezos is involved then there will definitely be a lot of profits flowing in from IVY.

For me, I'm long-term on $BB with some options to take advantage of the recent hype. I plan on holding shares until I see an actual competitor to QNX and IVY... which I've looked all over the internet and I can't find any. And honestly, Blackberry's security suite has so much to offer this isn't even the complete DD. I've just been typing for too long and figured it was a good time to stop. Maybe I will write another post in the future.",2021-01-19 02:28:44
Some Whale Watching and Analysis: Week of 1/19,0.97,"*This is long; I got lots of great questions after the whales 101 post so I‚Äôm trying to be thorough. If you don‚Äôt want long shit skip to positions and TLDR. If you want me to search a ticker, you can comment it or PM me and I‚Äôll try my best to get to it and we can talk shop. Inbox open all night like the trap house. *
________________

Some Unusual Options Activity caught my eye from Friday for this week.  I typically like to scan the prior Friday on the weekend, so I figured I‚Äôd share what I was looking at in case it gives you confirmation bias or an idea. 

*REMEMBER: UOA IS AN EDUCATED GUESSING GAME WHERE YOU ARE TRYING TO STAY ABOVE 50%, AND HAVE A FEW AMAZING BAGGERS HERE AND THERE. DO NOT YOLO WHALES*

**The way I‚Äôll break this down is by laying out my..**

**C choices:** Options activity that is intriguing, but seems like there is a strong possibility it could be a hedge, a sell the news event, isn't confirmed once I do more research, or hasn't been called out by Unusual Whales.  No precise formula. 

**B choices:** Ones I am pretty down to hop on, but need to see more.  I might be waiting for a dip, a related news event to play out, or this is one I feel could go against me big if it's an institutional hedge because of its Greeks. 

**A choices:** Shit I will likely buy right at the open, fits into what my thought process on a sector generally has been, and is simply a ticker I like.  
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

**C choices some whales bought:**

**FSLR and SPWR: Somebody is betting solar**

[UOA cluster example for both](https://i.imgur.com/5BzcmaV.jpg)
**FSLR**: underlying=96.85 **Order**: 110c 1/22 (IV 63.98%)

**SPWR**: underlying= 31.96 **Orders**: 33 and 37c 1/22

**Unusual Whales Alert:** FSLR no/SPWR YES 

**Earnings Reports**: Mid February

**Why I like it:** Solar cooled down a little bit after the Biden-stonk frenzy to start off the week.  ICLN, EV, etc could just be refueling, and aren't necessarily done running.

**Why I don‚Äôt like it:** Falling knives, and could still be finding the bottom of it's channel.  It had a hell of a run, and hopping in now feels greedy.  The volume on these orders is also low, which can be a coinflip as to what it means.  Sometimes 600-1,000 volume is the sweet spot, but

**IV and Greeks [SPWR greeks]:** shitty theta (you‚Äôre giving back almost 20% of premium price each day on the 1/29c) and IV at or near the money is already about 100% by this point.  The only upside to straight buying a call is playing the IV/Vega on Joe Biden's inauguration speech

**News confirmation and catalyst(s):** Biden's inauguration speech could lay out a great renewable energy plan that gives the whole sector a boost.  Last week people played weed, energy and EV in hopes that his Thursday speech would touch on these things--there is a much higher likelihood his inauration speech will.  Also, [huge news about the Keystone pipeline came out this weekend ](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55709261), and I don't know if this means uppies or downies for other oil companies, since big oil is trying to appeal by saying they'll switch sources. 

**Position**: Waiting to see how Keystone decision fallout hits them tomorrow morning.  If there is a significant dip I'll probably buy it for some 1/29 SPWR calls Wednesday morning and dump with a swiftness after inauguration.

**B choices**:

[**PEPüöÄüöÄ** underlying=141.39 **Orders**: 152.50 2/12c (IV 20.74%), 143c 1/22 (IV 16%)](https://i.imgur.com/67bZ71V.jpg)

**Unusual Whales**: No alert

**Earnings Report**: February 11th

**Why I kinda like it:** Didn't see many KO calls around, but saw the PEP calls; that contrast made the order stand out to me as more than a sector/industry bet.  The fact that the ER is one day before the 2/12 call expiration makes me like this play because I can pick up some IV along the way for what feels like a very oversold tech stalwart.  

**[IV and the Greeks:** Looks good to me, no major caution flags.  BUT, the bid/ask spread is a little wide.  This partially keeps it at C level; I‚Äôll probably put in a low bid, forget it, and see if the price action during the day gets the order filled.

**News confirmation and catalyst(s):**On Friday Lebron James announced he‚Äôs switching his KO sponsorship to a PEP sponsorship--which probably played into this UOA.  Looking into this more, I saw that it's an energy drink play and he's now attached to Mountain Dew's Rise energy drink.  Maybe PEP gets some price upgrades since people saw how much of a beast MNST has traditionally been, maybe this starts some conversation around the sector as a whole on CNBC, or maybe neither of those things happen.  BUT, with a relatively safe stock making a big name play leading into earnings, I'm willing to lose a little theta for a week to see if anything plays out.

**Position**: A relatively safe PEP 145c 2/12 while I play the waiting game for a week or so and reevaluate.  If it's smooth sailing, likely hold for a bit into the earnings run and sell before.

**FBüöÄüöÄ**: [Underlying= 251.36 / b: 252.50c, 257c 1/22, others (IV: 38% for 1/22, ~50% for 1/29)](https://i.imgur.com/gGXVZTA.jpg)

**Unusual Whale alert**: No

**Earnings Report**: 1/27

**Why I like it:** Welcome to earnings season for big tech, and FB is a steal right here.  They‚Äôve been pummelled, fairly or unfairly, in the ""censorship"" aftermath and is at a great level to bounce...you can't cuck the Zuck.  I have been seeing Fb calls with their own hedges trickle in like this since Wednesday and Thursday nonstop--there was some bad What's App backlash to their new privacy policy, but if anything that will be a tastier dip for Monday entry that is to be bought. 

**IV and the greeks:** slightly elevated IV because ER is coming, but fine.  Still plenty of room for an upward trajectory on IV/Vega.  The premium for 1/29 is a tad bit pricey, so if you can't afford that I'd look at a vertical call spread capping at 255 if you're going to play it with a close expiration.

**News confirmation and catalyst(s):** What's App issue is a potential albatross for tomorrow, but I do believe this will be a relatively smooth upward earning trajectory.  Also, their Oculus 2 demand numbers are going be through the roof and has great meme potential.  I don't usually hold through ER, but I may keep a lotto for this.  Been hovering around MA200, ready to bounce bounce.

**Position:** FB 1/29 255c, FB 2/19 260c

**DVN üöÄüöÄüöÄ**: underlying= 19.57 / **Orders**: 19.50, 20c, 21.50 1/22, many others with exp. from now to May. (IV high, around 100% on ATM weeklies) 
[DVN UOA](https://i.imgur.com/VL7iirc.jpg)

**Unusual Whales alert**: Yes

**Earnings Report:** Feb 16th

**Why I like it:** I've been seeing it pop up so much in clusters I can't ignore it any Longer. The volume has been intense in the whole sector.  [This Barron's article confirmed the activity I've been around energy.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/why-energy-could-have-a-tesla-like-2021-51610744972)  They compare it to TSLA--yes, TSLA.

**IV and the greeks**: IV is getting a bit high because of the overall energy spike, but I have confidence it's heading higher.  The bid/ask spread is problematic, though.  Will enter low and hope the order gets bought on a dip.

**News confirmation and catalyst(s):** aside from the call activity and the Barron's article pump, we have the inauguration for Biden to lay out a true vision for energy.  Early indications are that while solar, EV, etc are the hot names there is a place for truly evolving big oil companies.  They also just completed a merger on January 7th. Plus we have a nice dip tomorrow as an entry point with the Keystone news

**Positions**:  This is one that you buy LEAPS or monthlies on-- I'm looking at **2/19 121.5c and 3/19 121.5c **but I fully acknowledge that the bid/ask spread is a bitch at the moment.

**A list:**

[EDIT üöÄüöÄüöÄ](https://i.imgur.com/hgjrLgU.jpg): underlying = 76.14 / **Order**: 1/22 85c (IV 116%) 

**Why I Like It:** Ever since I missed the NIO/PLUG everything EV launch a couple months back, I've been looking for the next industry to go off.  Energy is one of my choices, the other is whatever the fuck is going on with Gene Editing.  Genetically constructed super-babies, so hot right now. I know ARKG exists as well, I consider that a part of this play too. 

**IV and the Greeks:** Unideal for the short term, as under 100% is a general rule of thumb, but I really like this as a long term hold--so much so that I'm going to recommend the S word here (ssssssshares).

**Confirmation and catalyst(s):**  [Barron's came out with this piece over the weekend,](https://www.barrons.com/articles/with-rare-speed-gene-editing-emerges-as-biotechs-new-cutting-edge-51610655079) which is part of what I'm sure that whale was chasing. 

>While gene-editing start-ups will lose money during years of clinical trials, it‚Äôs hard to say the stocks are overvalued. If their one-time interventions can cure diseases that otherwise require chronic treatment‚Äîor lack any treatment at all‚Äîthen the stocks will fly. 

**Position**: Opening up two LEAPs if I can get a dip so the 1/20/22 ask is only around 2,300.  Will chase on a 2/5 77 because the bid/ask spread on that strike is (relatively) reasonable and it feels doable. If this one is pricey for you consider call debit spreads.

**Two interesting trends from Friday UOA that I‚Äôm trying to connect some dots on:**

[1) Cruiseline puts were everywhere](https://i.imgur.com/AOuseNk.jpg)

I saw this enough that it made me think.  My hunch was that a lot of bad COVID recovery-stonk news is coming during inauguration (plus global trends).  That contrasted a little with the second interesting trend...

[2) Vaccines all got Unusual call options at various times](https://i.imgur.com/Z1AfJuF.jpg)
I saw MRNA got some UK upgrade attention today--maybe that was some of the reason, maybe that was none of the reason, but interesting nonetheless.

I checked Unusual Whales to see if they have any cruise alerts and they had the opposite of the orders I saw--a CCL 1/29 call alerted.  They also had MRNA 2/5 145 calls.  I'm going to stay away from the cruise puts, and probably go with some MRNA and NVAX 2/5 calls, slightly OTM depending where we open up.  It seems like the cruise puts were a hedge for a good week for vaccines. 

**Open Interest change notables**:

1) **Oil** saw huge OI increases for January and Feb expirations (XOM, PBR, etc).

2) **Uber** had huge OI increase for 2/19 both calls and puts.  Earning are 2/10

3) **F** and **GM** having obvious increases from their big splashes

4) **SRNE** had serious volume as well and lots of sporadic call buys

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

**Other options I saw I liked:** **BZUN 2/19 45c** **FEYE** 1/22 25c I will play as a 2/5, **WKHS** 25c 2/5

**Positions:**

**PEP** 145c 2/12

**FB** 1/29 255c, FB 2/19 260c

**DVN** 2/19 21.5c and 3/19 121.5c

**EDIT**: 2/5 77c

**INO/NVAX/MRNA** take your pick (Cruise puts hedge)
**EDIT: JUST NOTICED A 170c 1/22 NVAX I MISSED**

**VXX**: 1/29 18c and 19c. bigly hedged for inauguration shenigans. 

*waiting for a dip for some of these because I‚Äôm
Nervous about Thursday.* 

**TLDR**:
Energy, Gene editing, and Vaccines were all trending on Friday UOA.  FB has been getting a lot of call activity as well ahead of earnings.  PEP looks good for a run too on the heels of Lebron James signing pre-earnings.

NIO Printing Tendies: Call of the Month,0.93,"Hello retards I'm new to reddit but have been trading for a few years now. Here's my analysis on NIO, any feedback is appreciated.

&#x200B;

$NIO sold off toward the end of the week and is now sitting .3 CENTS ABOVE THE NEXT FIBONACCI RETRACEMENT LEVEL... PERFECT ENTRY POINT. Once we clear the next Fib trend level, near term prices could easily exceed $80+ and would further validate our trend line, which still appears bullish even after the selloff. Moral of my rant BTFD (BUY THE FUCKING DIP)

Great long opportunity especially considering a current RSI of sub 20 (way oversold) on no material changes in the company. We are still in a strong up-trend as can be viewed by the chart trend line and buying at an oversold level is an optimal entry point which is likely to continue given all technical factors.

There seems to be a common misconception that it's impossible to compete with Tesla. Think of Tesla like myspace. They were one of the first social media platforms with a successful business model, dominating the industry until Facebook had solutions for flaws in the system users didn't even realize existed. NIO isn't the next Facebook. But we're going to see something very similar unfold. The EV industry is still so young. Tesla basically created it's popularity and no one's had the chance to truly assess, adapt, and develop a business model that legitimately competes, until NIO.

Kick ass ET7 sedan they unveiled and next generation solid state batteries(providing 600+ miles of range on a single charge coming in the next year)

Battery as a service and battery swap stations are also taking off in China, this decrease upfront purchase price and longer range batteries makes $NIO eligible to continue receiving government subsidies unlike many competitors.

Tesla created the electric vehicle... NIO is reinventing the EV business.

"A retard's take on China, ADRs(NIO BABA) and Soft Power",0.75,"**TLDR: China would lose their soft power, banks and people would disinvest in China if they didn't honor their ADR/VIE agreements and would set China onto the path of future economic ruin and upheaval like the USSR - I could be wrong though but read on for my analysis with references (mostly!)**

&#x200B;

I've seen a few posts about ADRs/VIEs recently talking about how all chinese stocks (NIO BABA TENCENT) are based in the Cayman Islands and no one's really buying stock in these chinese companies and that China has no need to uphold these agreements - As a disclaimer, before I go on, I was to say I do own stock in NIO and BABA as well as AMZN, AAPL and a few other small AI companies.

While many of you may be technically correct about ADRs/VIEs, it fundamentally ignores the foreign policy climate of almost all countries and more specifically ignores the way China's foreign policy is being conducted right now - I'm not an expert and you should of course do your own DD but what I've noticed from all these posts is that they are all ignoring the idea of Soft Power.

**Lets define what soft and hard power are**: I've taken these definitions from wikipedia, because they're concise and as always wikipedia is well referenced (damn teachers!)

Soft power: In politics (and particularly in international politics), soft power is the ability to attract and co-opt, rather than coerce (contrast hard power). In other words, soft power involves shaping the preferences of others through appeal and attraction - Foreign Aid is an excellent example of the use of Soft Power

Hard Power: Hard power is the use of military and economic means to influence the behavior or interests of other political bodies. This form of political power is often aggressive (coercion), and is most immediately effective when imposed by one political body upon another of lesser military and/or economic power

**Why is this important?:**

While China is on its way to becoming a global superpower its not there yet, there are more economically reliable countries (US) and countries with more functional military might (Russia and US) - I say functional here because military might isn't just man power and number of soldiers.

China uses hard power when it comes to domestic policy, through the use of censorship, coercion of officials, imprisonment of dissidents and so on and so forth. ([https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/china/report-china/](https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/china/report-china/))

However, they've also learnt from the collapse of the USSR which collapsed in part due their international and economic isolation among other factors ([https://www.britannica.com/story/why-did-the-soviet-union-collapse](https://www.britannica.com/story/why-did-the-soviet-union-collapse)) - Now China doesn't want that to happen and to ensure it doesn't, it's followed an interesting hybridisation of communism and capitalism where private companies are closely linked to the government but are allowed to compete and have private ownership. However this has meant that chinese companies and by extension China as a country has to be attractive to outside investors and that's where soft power comes in.

Throughout the pandemic and even before China has been trying to expand its soft power further in the hope of eventually leveraging itself into the world's leading super power. Case and point is the Free trade agreement it signed with 14 other asia-pacific countries creating an even larger free market than the eu (16% vs 22%) ([https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/15/china-and-14-asia-pacific-countries-agree-historic-free-trade-deal](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/15/china-and-14-asia-pacific-countries-agree-historic-free-trade-deal)). While this gives it more economic power, it also gives china great headlines!

This isn't the only way China is trying to garner a better image of itself and therefore more soft power - For a long time, China has been and is commonly viewed as one of the largest polluters in the world ([https://ge.usembassy.gov/chinas-air-pollution-harms-its-citizens-and-the-world/#:\~:text=The%20People's%20Republic%20of%20China,health%20and%20the%20world's%20economy](https://ge.usembassy.gov/chinas-air-pollution-harms-its-citizens-and-the-world/#:~:text=The%20People's%20Republic%20of%20China,health%20and%20the%20world's%20economy).), pollution that has been killing around a million of its citizens a year - so to not only improve their citizens lives (though how much of the main motivation that is I'm very skeptical) but to also capture the ongoing trend of renewable energy becoming the dominant energy market in the next decade or two, China has been pouring money into clean energy initiatives, so they not only capture a significant slice of an upcoming dominant market but they are also able to position themselves as the clean energy capital of the world.

Let's be clear though, the current pandemic has affected their soft power and reduced it massively which leads onto the crux of my argument.

**How Soft power relates to ADRs/VIEs and Stocks?**

For China to successfully follow through with their plans (leveraging soft power into economic might - the tried and tested american way to an extent - except america had WW2 and the Marshall plan to reach this point sidenote: I know that's massively reductive and there's a lot of other factors involved in america becoming a superpower including a shit load of hard power i.e. nuclear bombs and military might) they require investment not just from domestic sources but foreign sources otherwise they gain no soft power. So how does this relate the ADRs/VIEs:

If China and Chinese companies were to renege on their agreements with these shell companies, it would lead to major banks, hedge funds and entire countries to disinvest from the chinese economy - a counterpoint I can imagine in the comments may be that it's technically not a reneging because the these chinese companies and chinese law doesn't state that you can own shares but the optics of it certainly are. Every major newspaper would be covering it, people who have invested would be using their soft power (their vote) to push for harder line on china and so would banks who would be disinvesting by their droves from chinese ADRs/VIEs. I know I wouldn't be buying anything from China again because the risk is too high and that would be the most dangerous thing for the chinese government. They are trying and have until now succeeded in creating an image of a stable thriving economy

Disinvestment may sound sensationalist and to an extent I would agree it may be but the most recent example is BABA stock - The disappearance of Jack Ma not only lead to a massive drop in BABA stock but countless headlines about how dangerous it is to invest in Chinese companies - and while I'm sure Jack Ma when he returns will have to change to adapt to his potentially curbed reality, the chinese government will have also realised that they'll need to adapt to ensure that they don't lose the soft power they've spent over 40 years cultivating ( look up Deng Xiaoping's China reform and opening-up policy).

And to address comments that I'm sure will say China can be self sufficient without any foreign investments - I'm sure they can but that path has until now lead to ruin for other countries, the primary example being the USSR and a less prominent example being North Korea. The chinese government is ruthless, efficient and they're certainly not stupid.

Of course if anyone thinks I'm wrong, please let me know - I also understand that the BABA example is more nuanced than how far I've gone into it because of Jack Ma's Ant group going onto central bank turf but the logic behind the point stands.

Hong Kong is an interesting counterpoint to my argument, but I would say that to a certain extent, Banks knew HK would be bought under the CCP and still think they can make money there - also Hong Kong massively damaged Chinese Soft power and if there had been a better president I think the effect would have been huge but there wasn't and the markets are over it - if ADRs aren't honoured, then Banks and hedge funds would lose money and I think that that's their bottom line and a red line for them - I could be wrong though

Edit: The other response I've seen is that under chinese law VIEs are illegal and China can just declare them as such and we'd all be shit out of luck - and while yes it could do that, that would be one of the greatest acts of self harm conducted by a nation in history, there's around 2 trillion in Chinese VIEs (FT 2019 article - can't find the link rn), for China to declare them invalid would essentially be China putting itself into complete total international isolation and this idea also ignores the fact that China is also heavily invested in the US, owning around 1.1 trillion in US debt and the Yuan is tied to the dollar - all in all would be mutually assured destruction that China would most likely not recover from ",2021-01-18 18:46:58
Indian Stocks $TTM $WIT $INFY,0.74,"While the GME gang and Tesla finish up posting their Gain porn from last week I wanted to talk about a boomer level DD.

I had started working on this post last week and never posted on it, but I still think Indian stocks had significant value moving forward. The Indian economy is growing 8% a year which is 2% greater than the US economy year over year. The entire infrastructure in Indian is still being built, so the country hasn't even really started its industrial revolution. This means its established companies have a lot of room to grow with an emerging market of 1BILLION people.

&#x200B;

$TTM was my safest bet, but it already started its climb thanks to Tesla. In the last two weeks alone $TTM climbed from 11.50 to 18. They are a car company that is moving into the EV landscape and will likely be Tesla's main competitor in India. The main advantage they have is existing relationships with the Indian state governments. Government contracts in India are extremely important because each state has its own cultural identity. They don't conform to the popular culture of Delhi and are actually more likely to give there business to a company like Tata Motors. This gives TTM a huge advantage since it has contracts in the southern Indian states (most recently Kerala). If companies like XPev and Nio have sustainable interest Tata Motors should be a clear favorite. 

&#x200B;

The company I am most interested in is Wipro ($WIT). This is an information technology company worth billions. They had been struggling for years before 2020, when they replaced their CEO with a much more aggressive executive office. Since then their growth as been apparent and they are taking a more revenue driven approach. Now why would this company trading at under $7 a share have value? Well 80% of this companies revenue is currently in North America and Europe. That means this Indian company has NOT even tapped its own market. That is about to change, starting in April Wipro is taking over the Indian locations of a German company Metro AG. This deal was worth 700million when signed, but does not actually take affect for a couple of months. That means the current 6.4 stock value will rocket in about 4 months. This takeover is the start of Wipro having regional monopolies in Indian, something that is not heavily legislated in their country. The stock has mid term growth protentional and June options for this company are currently really cheap. Its not an overnight gain like GME, but this one should pay off as the US economy may start to falter.  

&#x200B;

I am currently in on both of these and $INFY for shares and calls. As we get closer to April I will probably YOLO on Wipro options, so you can look out for that in a couple months.",2021-01-18 18:07:28
NIO battery swapping station vs Tesla supercharger analysis,0.82,"NIO battery swapping station vs Tesla supercharger (efficiency, space) 

NIO‚Äôs 2nd generation battery swapping station:
- holds 13 batteries
- takes up four parking spaces 
- can swap 312x per day (5 mins/swap)

Tesla‚Äôs supercharger:
- takes up one parking space
- takes 75 mins to 100% recharge (max: 19.2x/day)

Assuming full capacity, in order for Tesla to fully recharge 312 batteries/day, Tesla would need 16.25 superchargers (16.25 parking spaces). 

Efficiency: NIO wins (5 mins vs 75 mins)

Space: NIO wins (4 parking spaces vs 16.25 parking spaces). This is especially important in crowded cities like Shanghai, NYC where land is expensive.  

I don‚Äôt have the cost of NIO stations and Tesla superchargers so I can‚Äôt do a cost analysis.  I know the cost of 2nd generation stations is 1/2 the cost of first generation so cost is going down.  

NIO is planning to double its swapping stations to 500 by the end of 2021.  Therefore, NIO would need 500 x 13 batteries = 6,500 batteries.  Assuming each battery cost $10,000...the total cost is $65m.  

Unknown:  Can Tesla reduce recharging time? It is possible but due to safety and degradation issues, recharging time has not changed much over the years.

Update:  I used 100% recharge for comparison purpose.  It takes a Tesla supercharger 40 minutes to recharge 80% of the original 85kWh battery.  Even if I were to compare 80% of Tesla  (supercharger) to 100% of NIO (battery swapping station), Tesla would still lose by a mile.",2021-01-18 17:08:43

Fucking Alibaba. This is an absolute juggernaut of a company that is currently plagued by every piece of FUD possible. Chinese government whipped out the cock & a centimeter ruler. Ant Group IPO hamstrung. Impending regulation. Jack Ma in hiding for fear of having his mouth cauterized shut. Down 30% from ATH. WSB mocking call holders who caught the falling knife. This kind of dark cloud overhang is exactly what I look for in my trades. There are always big gain opportunities, but comeback stories often have a lower floor than other highflying momentum opportunities (GME, EVs, SPACs).

&#x200B;

**\*\*\*\*\*CATALYSTS AND OPPORTUNITIES\*\*\*\*\***

&#x200B;

**RELATIVE VALUATION:**

First and foremost, this is a great company. This isn't some kind of ""I'm the smartest idiot in town"" play where you try and make a buck off of something worthless. This is a truly undervalued equity. Chinese stocks have been super hot lately. Mega hot. This isn't necessarily bubbly. China is arguably the strongest market in the world and the emerging middle class over there will fuel rocket-like growth for years to come. Look up Dalio's thoughts on China if you need to be convinced. Stocks like JD, PDD, BILI, BIDU, NIO, have all seen unbelievable rises. Money managers are foaming at the mouth looking for Chinese exposure. I don't blame them. However, after these astronomical rises, money managers will start rebalancing positions and looking for new opportunities. Cue Alibaba. This one has herpes currently. It won't have herpes forever. There's a black swan risk for Alibaba. It won't happen. As gains get trimmed in other Chinese stocks money will flow to BABA undoubtedly. The valuation is too sexy. It's been underperforming for reasons that have absolutely fucking nothing to do with fundamentals.

**UM AKSHYUALLY IT'S A VIE YOU DON'T OWN THE STOCK**

Shut the fuck up. People talk about the ownership structure like it's a latent scam to defraud American's of 100s of billions of dollars. This will not happen. China needs access to US capital markets. This would singlehandedly destroy that relationship and hamstring China. Yes, China is the manufacturing capitol of the world. Yes, the USA is the financial capital of the world. We are mutually dependent. If this falls through, we all have way bigger problems than your $2000 call position. Market is fucked period if USA & China go nuclear in the financial markets. Nothing functions without Chinese sourcing.

**INVEST WITH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT**

CCP has a ownership interest in Alibaba. The CCP also came out and said that they want ownership stake in Ant as well. It's so transparent. CCP is pushing down Alibaba's value, seizing more ownership, then going to let it fly with favorable outcomes to the FUD that they created themselves. Do you really think China is going to kill something that is seen as the golden goose of Chinese ingenuity and progress? China wants to become an economic superpower at all costs. I don't care if the put Jack Ma in prison for life. This thing will continue to grow. Baba is bigger than Jack Ma.

**HOLY FUCK LOOK AT THE FUNDAMENTALS** ***( skip if you're afraid of numbers )***

30% YoY revenue growth. 60% YoY growth in AWS copycat. 900 million MAUs. FCF up 33% YoY to $6 Billion US. Increased share buyback.

And the margins. Look at the fucking margins. 29% net profit margin for FY 2019. With 30% Revenue growth. AMZN's net margin is 4%. This thing is an EPS powerhouse that will continue to see ***bonerworthy*** FCF and boost buybacks. In my opinion, this is literally the cheapest listed stock in the world. Held down by FUD.

**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*FINALLY- WHAT MAKES THIS MOON?\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

**#1- Jan 20-** Joe Biden takes office. He wants to show all his friends how much cooler he is than Donald Trump, so he gets a patty-cake deal done with China. Fears about delisting subside. Institutional money gets braver. Black swan risk becomes more muted. I expect positive China relationship commentary to come out within a month of him getting sworn in. His administration will be much less hostile and unpredictable. Great for BABA & US/China relations.

**#2- Feb 11-** Earnings. Earnings will be stellar as always. China handled Covid way better than we did and its economy has been chugging ahead at full stream. The great numbers will remind everyone how fucking cheap this thing is. Expect a pop if it hasn't already ran up a shit ton beforehand.

**#3- Date unknown-** Resolution gets announced between CCP and Alibaba. It will not be as bad as everyone expects. This is literally a dog and pony show to show everyone how cool and strong the government is. Once that uncertainty gets removed, this thing flies. Same goes for Ma reappearance. When that dude comes back with his 1000 yard stare and says everything is cool, expect an instant pop in share price. There is literally every bad piece of news baked into this. This is where you want to be going long.

**How do I play it?**

Shares are fine. I was long BABA shares, sold them to buy LEAPs because the pricing was so good. 40% IV not bad for the actual volatility I expect. I wouldn't buy calls expiring before the summer. Time is your friend here because of the situation and waiting on clouds. It has been trading in a tight range from 220-245, If it dips back to 220 I'm adding summer expiry 270 strike calls to my position which I will unload when it breaks out, letting my LEAPs ride.

When this thing shakes off the bad press it will fly. I can see $400 before EOY, at which price it'll still be cheaper than its peers.

**Positions: 2x 300C LEAPs expiring Jan 20, 2023, cost basis $6500, current value $8200**   üöÄüöÄüöÄ

TLDR up front, BlackBerry has pivoted away from making phones and instead is in the software sector. Some big names that they have include,  [SpaceX](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=0&article=1737&context=smallsat&type=additional), **Nvidia**, **NIO**, **Xpeng**, **Ford** and 19 out of the 25 EV companies now use QNX.

**Software**

BlackBerry has gone away from the phones business and has reinvented itself to become the main player in Automobile OS systems. They have lock and key in this market since many OEMs don't want to start from the ground up making the software themselves. As of June,2020 they have the QNS software in over[175 million cars](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-175-million-vehicles-301081594.html). Nvidia uses BlackBerries QNX for the base of its [self-driving car](https://channeldailynews.com/news/nvidia-to-build-its-ai-self-driving-platform-on-blackberry-qnx/58048). Sony is also partners with Nvidia and BlackBerry for the car they are [making.](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-reveals-more-details-on-its-secretive-vision-s-sedan/) Not to mention the companies that use QNX are subscription based, so reoccurring revenue. This is speculation on this part but Hyundai is using QNX and has partnered with Apple, and carplay is a layer built on QNX.

**Fundamentals**

BlackBerry recently just sold all of there phone [patents](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-blackberry-sells-90-patents-to-huawei-covering-key-smartphone/) to Huawai showing that they are no longer in the phone sector. Big Boys have been adding more BB to there pockets and the last 13F was on the 15th (1/15/21) (Fin---tel)

Other big short inst---itutions have a hard on for keeping this low, BB was in the top 20 most shorted stocks but GME was number 1. Just this Friday(1/15) Shorts and inst---itutions sold alot.

Morningstar and CFRA both put $BB with a fair value price of 6.40, so you can assume that is the absolute bottom. (copied from [u/ThegreatLoudini](https://www.reddit.com/u/ThegreatLoudini/))

Papa Cohen and his raging hard on to make change,0.97,"Not a shitpost, I promise boys. Hear me out on this DD.

Ryan Cohen is all in on GME. From the jump, he has been committed to turning Gamestop into the Amazon of games. He has a throbbing raging hard on to blow GME to the fucking moon. He shitposts on his Twitter about Blockbuster and Jim Cramer. GME is forcing T-rex dinosaur looking wrinkly tapioca pudding eating old fucks off the board. RC is a fellow autist.

But more importantly boys: He's a fucking billionaire. He bought 550 Million dollars of Tesla last year.

GME has 71 Million shares and Papa Cohen can exercise purchase of 7% to up his ownership. That's roughly 5 million shares. 5 Million X $36 is 180 Million. Why would he not spend 1/3 of what he spent on tesla on his own vision? Why the FUCK would Papa Cohen not suck up the rest of his entitled shares to throw green dildos at the shorts. He's an activist and believes in the mission. He can afford it.

I believe we will see news over the long weekend (the perfect catalyst) to increase his %. This would be the ultimate dick slam in the faces of Melvin, Wallstreet, and all the gay bears.

**Listen here you paper hand having bastards. If you cant get handle the ride, you're in the wrong place. I want you to sell your BB, NIO, and PLTR and go to the nearest home improvement store. Buy a shovel. Dig 150 kilometers to the earth's mantle and stick your tiny little girly hands into this beautiful melting earth we call home. Your hands will develop into diamonds and you will emerge a true retard autist surrounded by the glow of DFV.**

As we march forth toward the rocket ship launchpad, we will be applauded by all of those that have fallen before us. Think about the college savings account you emptied that keeps you from looking your sweet children in their eyes. Think about that stupid fucking Tom that bothers you at work every day about his magic the gathering collection. Think about the true Chad that your wife is fucking.

It is time to rise from the ashes of your failed YOLO attempts and become true champions in the eyes of our lord and savior, Papa Ryan Cohen. On this battlefield, he will stand with us and deliver gain porn that we will all be able to fap to for years to come as we munch on our tendies. Hold, Buy, Cum, but do not sell. Eat your tendies with me and rejoice as we become the first 1.9 Million person spaceflight to the moon.

Edit: Literally think about the story. 35-year-old uber-successful business-minded big dick having RC comes into the most recognized gaming brand in history and turns it around. within a month, the market cap of the company increases 4 fold and he saves 55K jobs. Fucking come on guys who wouldn't want to make that happen? The kid knows what he's doing, he's held his tongue to watch the puts expire today.

Unusual Options Activity 101: Whale Watching Tips,0.98,"This is long, if you‚Äôre uninterested skip to the ten tips list or TLDR

A while ago I started mixing unusual options activity into my ~~gambling~~investing.  At first I lost a shitload of money chasing dumbass whales with zero plan, but now I actually have a pretty good feel for it.  I still fuck up alot, but more often I do not fuck up.  This is to help those of you who want to start chasing whales, or are at a basic level and want to do it better.

I'm using some plays from this week as examples because they are fresh in my mind and I have a couple screenshots.

**Tools**
I use barchart in tandem with Unusual Whales. For barchart, you can honestly get by using their free version, you just can't sort as well.  They have a free month trial too.  I also pay the 20 bucks for Unusual Whales to confirm what I scan, and they have a good stocks volume standard deviation tool.  I have zero affiliation to either, just saying what I use.

There are way more technical ways to do this, but I like to use my eyes to scan sporadically throughout the day like a boomer.

**Basic Concept**
Long story short, you're ideally chasing the options purchases of what are, presumably, deep-pocketed individuals or institutions.  UOA identifies certain options contract orders that are higher than the average daily contract order.  For example, if the average daily option volume on an GME weekly is 4,000, and an option order enters for 4,000 or higher, it's flagged as unusual activity since it's a multiple of that daily average volume--sometimes it shows as multiple orders if ""they"" push through a few smaller purchases that produce heavy volume.

MM are sneks who like to move in silence, which they can do with with stock positions via dark pools and the like.  However, they can't get away with that with options activity--it all shows.  That fact, young autist, is your slingshot against the institutional goliath.

**Hunting the Whale**
So I've got my unusual options activity page open on barchart or wherever for the current day.  I adjust the expiration date option so that the options I'm looking at don't expire past a couple weeks out (more on why later), then I'm ready to eye scan.

I typically start by looking for **one of two things: 1) large clusters of orders that belong to one ticker  or 2) sporadic orders for a ticker that consistently show up over a couple hours, but belong to non-hot, non-meme stonks that do NOT have earnings imminent.**  To make sure I'm looking at something potentially weird, I choose to exclude options that expire more than a couple weeks out.

**1) Clusters of orders‚ÄîABNB example**
The way I scope it is kind of a tiered process.  *First*, I'm looking to see if there are any clusters of orders that catch my eye on a quick scan.  *Second*, I'm looking to see if those clusters of orders contain both calls AND puts, with some OTM activity and spreads preferred.  *Third*, I look to see if the number of seperate call orders outweighs the number of put orders (or vice versa), and additionally I look to see if the volume of the calls drastically outweighs the volume of the puts (or vice versa).  

**Why?  Because it helps you determine if the options order is just a hedge, or if it‚Äôs hedging against itself as it‚Äôs own positio**n. This is super important so try to follow along-- most UOA is just institutions hedging; Mr. MM has a nice, busy life and fancy yacht and can't just exit his positions back and forth all day like a WSBer.  He also has like a billion shares of his stonks, so if he dumps it when he's got paper hands it will siginficantly tank the value and cause a ripple effect.  So, *instead* of hedging by dumping his shit, he hedges by adding OTM options against his position--next level fucking diamond hands.  That would be the type of whale order from Mr. MM we don't want to follow.  *But*, if Mr. MM buys 4,000 FB call options in a few blocks, and you see like 1,000 in FB puts go through right alongside it, the odds are that someone is betting big on FB and using the puts as a hedge, since the puts represent a smaller volume in the call/put ratio.  Instead of the options being a hedge for a bigger stock position they hold, these types of option clusters indicate that the option order itself is the big, independent play, and it's hedging itself with lower volume order vs the higher volume (4,000 calls to 1,000 puts).

**Then I do an easy confirmation**.  I check the tickers general trend the past week or so in a chart, do a news search on twitter of their ticker for news catalysts and sentiment, and google and YouTube to see if the crayola kids think it's a good nerd play.

**Example**: Here's the screenshot on some ABNB UOA I noticed and played this week.  It went to 200% and change within a couple hours, but I had unfortunate diamond hands and sold for about half that.

[ABNB UOA](https://i.imgur.com/mYDXYmN.jpg)

So, this a softball.  **First**, you can see that ABNB all of a sudden explodes with all these options showing up at 12:52‚Äìthat's our cluster.  **Second**, the clusters have both calls and puts in that minute timespan, with some put orders showing at the bottom of the cluster.  Some of the calls are deep OTM, as far as 200c.  **Third**, the call orders far outweigh the put orders in both amount and volume.  *Awwwww shit, looks like we got more than a hedge‚Äîwe‚Äôre onto something.*

**Confirmation time**: ABNB had been on a general uptrend, and I typically don't like to chase, but I combed twitter and saw their were rumors of the CEO speaking the following day, and that news had just broken of their DC booking cancellations.  I looked back into the morning, and saw a few more unusual blocks, and a few more rolled in just after the cluster pictured above.

Passed the smell test.  Options bought, tendies gained.

**Sparse Orders: SNAP example**

The same principles can apply to orders on tickers that pop up individual orders, not large clusters,  which **a) haven‚Äôt had much attention b) have been on a steep downtrend‚Äîthis makes the order unusual, and/or c) seem to keep popping up in single orders over a few hours to a day.**The same principles as above apply, but if you see these types of orders with very little time left until expiration, you can assume assume it's probably not a hedge.  SNAP isn't the best example of the week because there wasn't a put order in this block.  But, there was positive TA sentiment when I searched, SNAP had been on an oversold downtrend, and I don't have screenshots left of the better ones I saw and went after.  **Plus, importantly, IT WAS TOWARDS THE END OF THE DAY** (this is huge, EOD is prime time for AH news whales)

[SNAP UOA](https://i.imgur.com/GGr5bra.jpg)

A better example from this week though is SPCE, which had only a few orders sprinkled throughout the day, and one toward the end of the day which was DEEP, DEEP OTM expiring 1/15.  **That‚Äôs a flag for us‚Äîsporadic listing throughout the day, OTM toward the end of the day. ** BAM! EOD SPCE OTM calls sprinkle in, ARK invests to kick off AH, SPCE moons. 

**Sparse Orders Patterns: Connecting the dots on tech rebound with FB and SNAP**

Seeing the SNAP orders above sharpened my eyes that day to looking for a pattern with tech on the whole, since big tech had been so royally gaped the past week.  I kept seeing FB options like this pop up

[https://i.imgur.com/muVGtq2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/T54peER.jpg)

Sometimes you can put together sporadic listings and create a working theory based on a sector.  Because this and similar FB orders were deep OTM and one day out, I knew there was a risk they could a hedge, but also knew that the tech sector was due for a rebound and saw SNAP posting sporadic OTM as well.  **So, I bought my options for each of those two another week out and closer to ATM (important, more below), to give the whale some breathing room** in case was it was a hedge, even though the technicals agreed with the bounce.  The whales were right, and it was an easy little overnight profit.


**How I‚Äôve Fucked Up 1: Don‚Äôt get tricked by trends**

Although we like to believe institutions are ahead of the curve, often they are just trend-riding lemmings who follow what's already way, way up.  They buy the top, just like WSB tardies such as yourself specialize in.  So, when you see shit like this below, take a minute to think before you get excited:

[NIO UOA LIKE THIS WAS NONSTOP](https://i.imgur.com/JCZBx2s.jpg)

It was the same for all the memes: PLUG, FCEL, MARA, and RIOT all week, dominating the orders.  If something is already too popular, just stay away from it.  You can ride something up, but when you see massive orders on shit that's already like 400% IV, just...don't.

**How I‚Äôve Fucked Up 2: DO give the MM‚Äôs some breathing room**

*Even if you‚Äôre confident in a move you see that is a few days out, extend your play a week or two further out minimum, and strike it closer to ATM.*  If you can't do either of those things because you can't afford the premium just skip that play and check back for something new later; I promise a better opportunity will arise.  You can recover from bagholding, but you cannot recover from blowing your account on an incorrect 0DTE.

Breathing room is also important because often whales will have the news but not the exact timing.  Two months ago I followed a DDOG whale on a Thursday 1DTE that expired worthless the next day.  The following Monday (1 trade day later) DDOG made the announcement that rocketed them like 20%--if I'd given them a week's breathing room, it would've been a 15 bagger.  Fucking F.

**So, to review:** look for order clusters or sporadic ticker orders that a) have a mix of calls and puts with one dominating the other b) unpopular tickers that have deep OTM or close expirations c) always check chatter afterward and fundamentals and d) try to put together a narrative of things that are related that catch your eye (this Monday's EV run or this Friday's tech bounce could be next week's airline dominance or cruiseline craze--connect the dots).  Initially look for options expiring soon, as they indicate the most riskiness--and therefore confidence--if the MM is not hedging.  Shop with a short term eye, buy with a long term choice. 

**10 Things That Will Help You Not GUH:**

**1)** Monday and Friday morning/afternoon are the most accurate whale times, according to data from Unusual Whales

**2)** If you don't have PDT always save some spending power for EOD shopping

**3**) If you don't have PDT never, ever follow a whale with a weekly.  Sometimes the news the whale bets on is a 'sell the news' event, and you won‚Äôt recover from a drop especially if there is IV crush involved. 

**4)** Always give the whale breathing room by purchasing an expiration at least a week further out

**4b**) Always give the whale breathing room by going closer to ATM strikes than theirs

**5)** Sign up for barchart monthly trial (then continue it) and unusual whales--they're each like 20 bucks and thats way less than you spend on an FD. 

**6**) You don't need to learn TA, but you need to check technicals on the tickers you want to chase--almost every major ticker has youtubers or fintwits giving their daily or weekly TA.  This way you know if it's a proper breakout happening if the whale hits, and you're not just guessing at when to take profits.  Remember, whales can buy wayyyyyyy OTM and sell for massive profit at any point--they *aren‚Äôt* bagholding a call until it's in the money like you are. You may be 10% up waiting for the next 80% GME day while your whale has sold at their target 5% profits on the play and is chillin. 

**7**) Leave at least 10% of your account spending power free each day.  I promise, the one time you go full boat you will see the most obvious whale play at the end of the day.  Then you won't be able to do shit about it and you'll hate yourself when it's a 10 bagger overnight.  Trust me.

**8**) Make sure the ticker you're chasing isn't just ER anticipation/bets.  Always check earnings dates before buying.

**9**) Remember whales are people, so they can be stupid, too.  Don't baghold a position that is clearly fucked for some news that looks unlikely to come.  They are gambling addicts just like you, except they have more money.

**10**) Always take profits if you ask yourself if it's time to.  If it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to close the position.

***

TLDR
Use a service to follow whales so you can get ahead of announcements.  Look for clusters of options activity that hedge themselves via call/put ratio, and do a legitimate check for TA and catalysts to confirm their moves.  Never follow a whale into a weekly, but use weeklies are your best screener.

Li Auto compared to XPEV and NIO,0.65,"Li Auto, trade ticker Li, is another one of the Chinese EV car makers like XPEV and NIO. It has risen, but not as fast as the other two. The price targets for the company are very generous. Current trading prices are around $33, with a market cap of around 30 billion. XPEV is valued at around 39 Billion, and Nio at 90 Billion.

Nio has delivered 36,700 cars in 2020

 XPEV around 27000 cars

Li Auto with around 32600 cars.

They've outsold XPEV and are right on the heels of NIO. They don't have a name as catchy, but they are very popular in China.

I think they have the most room to grow out of the EVs and are most likely to pop.

It's dipped a lot today, so I'm buying up shares/options now.

Is it too late to get in on some $BBBY tendies? I think not!,0.87,"**TL:DR:** Get in, loser. We're riding this baby to Uranus. short positions most likely increased after ""shit"" earnings that were not bad at all. we've only seen the beginning of the squeeze as Technicals look unsustainable long term but primed for a rally short term, share buyback working in tandem with Cramer pumping the stock creates a bloodbath for gay bears. Buying stock is best just like GME because you wanna move that ticker baby. Calls for ballsy tendies

&#x200B;

This week has been **great** for bulls. First GME came through for us and fucked over Melvin and the rest of the boomers leaving us with all these sweet tendies to pick up off the ground and BBBY has EXPLODEDDD this week following a bad earnings call that led to a huge sell off and retreat to **$17** from **over $21**. But was the earnings call really as bad as everyone thought it was? Is the price movement just a result of a short squeeze that is already over?

I think not

1. earnings were **not** as bad as people acted they were, you bet your ass bears tried to short this shit in reaction to the supposed negative numbers while over looking these : **69% increase in digital sales, 150 million share buyback program to complete by end of Feb, continually trimming debt, pivoting to curbside/delivery/digital sales programs and increasing the value of coupons through membership programs to promote brand loyalty** (think Amazon Prime free shipping), **RECCURING REVENUE BUNDLE ( THIS SHIT IS CRACK FOR YOY GROWTH, think AMZN, NFLX, and even NIO now)**

2. **76 million shares in short interest out of 114 free floating.** this is self explanatory after GME but whats interesting is these numbers are from a December 31st settlement. This absolutely grew over the earnings on the 7th. making this potential for profit even more likely. our favorite boomer, Cramer, also pumped the fuck outta this stock on Mad Money TWICE recently stating the short interest is an attempt by bears to capture the stock despite strong promise from within the company.

1. **TA looks incredibly solid.** Riding the RSI at 70 all day baby. MACD Signal line cross was never destructive, consolidates around support levels, then built up a climb over time, challenging areas of support and bouncing off of them to new highs and lower lows. Trending above 50 day MA, 25 day EMA, and using 10 day MA as support, testing multiple times throughout the day and later consolidating alongside it today until AH.

Profit from EV without buying EV - Market lack of supply for semiconductors.üöÄüöÄ,0.94,"If you agree, please upvote this. Not for me, but so that others can see it.

The EV hype has caused lots of EV stocks to moon. Whether or not this will continue no one knows and I don‚Äôt care. There has recently been a large shortage of semiconductors for cars. As more and more companies start to produce electronic vehicles, and as these stocks get pumped, the demand for these semiconductors will go up. Already, there is a severe shortage in car chips. 

Don‚Äôt believe me? You don‚Äôt have to.

You see all those? ON semiconductor is not very well known, but makes chips in the USA. Now out of that big chunk of links I sent, read the last three.

The news has been coming out over the past few days, even CNN is carrying a story about it, but the mooning (fortunately for you) hasn‚Äôt started yet.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/13/business/global-chip-shortages-carmakers/index.html

The EV companies want to beat out their competition and make cars as fast as they can. But there are no chips to do it. This means they will start to pay absurd prices for these chips, since they are at such a crucial moment for the company. 

You can capitalise on this by buying calls or shares before this large shortage and hidden gem of an industry is uncovered. 

RELEVANT Positions: 
ON Feb 5 $38
ON Feb 19 $38

This company uses big data and the cloud to sell makeup. In the last three years, it used state of art technology to catapult themselves from a company nobody had heard of to owning three successful brands that have reached #1 in China. Yada yada yada. I could go on more about fundamental bullshit, but anybody can make an upcoming company sound like amazon and if you google the company you‚Äôll find tonnes of articles explaining this stuff.

*****

#[Today's Top Headlines for Wenesday, January 13th, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-13-2021.html)

# 5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday

*****

> # 1. Stocks set for modest drop
> * U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday, a day after Wall Street resumed its 2021 upswing with modest gains. The fallout from last week‚Äôs Capitol riot and the push to impeach President Donald Trump have been keeping a lid on market moves this week. Rising rates in the bond market, with the 10-year Treasury yield over 1.1%, have also been a headwind for stocks. However, ahead of Wednesday‚Äôs trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 were less than 1% away from their records. The Nasdaq was just over 1% away from its record high.

> * Target said Wednesday comparable sales rose 17.2% in November and December. While online sales remained robust during the pandemic, shoppers also visited Target‚Äôs stores and spent more money per purchase than they did last holiday season. Target‚Äôs same-day curbside pickup grew by more than 500%, while sales fulfilled by its Shipt delivery service grew more than 300% during the holidays. Target shares were relatively flat in premarket trading.

*****

> # 2. House to impeach Trump
> * Trump is on the verge of being impeached for a second time. The House set the unprecedented vote for Wednesday, exactly one week after supporters of the outgoing president attacked the U.S. Capitol. While no House Republicans voted for Trump‚Äôs first impeachment, this time a small but significant number, including third-ranking GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, will join Democrats.

> * Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has reportedly told associates he thinks Trump committed impeachable acts, though it‚Äôs not known if the Kentucky Republican would vote to remove the president. A conviction in the Senate, even after Trump leaves office, would prevent him from becoming president again. It‚Äôs unclear if the Senate would try to hold Trump‚Äôs impeachment trial before President-elect Joe Biden‚Äôs inauguration next Wednesday.

*****

> # 3. Pence rules out 25th Amendment
> * The House is moving ahead with its impeachment vote after Vice President Mike Pence ruled out invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump. The House on Tuesday night passed a resolution calling on Pence and the Cabinet to push Trump out of office over his role in fomenting the Capitol attack. In a letter to House Speak Nancy Pelosi, Pence wrote, ‚ÄúI do not believe that such a course of action is in the best interest of our Nation or consistent with our Constitution.‚Äù

> * Speaking publicly Tuesday for the first time since last week‚Äôs siege, Trump did not take any responsibility for the mob violence and warned a second impeachment could be dangerous for the country. Later in the day at the border wall in Texas, Trump made a vague threat against Biden while insisting Pence and his Cabinet won‚Äôt remove him from office.

*****

> # 4. YouTube suspends Trump account
> * YouTube on Tuesday suspended Trump‚Äôs account, saying the president uploaded content that violated its policies, though it did not specify any videos. The so-called strike-one on the platform prevents new uploads for a minimum seven days. ‚ÄúGiven the ongoing concerns about violence, we will also be indefinitely disabling comments on President Trump‚Äôs channel,‚Äù said YouTube, owned by Alphabet‚Äôs Google unit. YouTube‚Äôs decision to freeze Trump‚Äôs account follows the indefinite suspension of the president‚Äôs Facebook and the permanent suspension of his Twitter.

*****

> # 5. Operation Warp Speed chief resigns
> * Operation Warp Speed Chief Adviser Dr. Moncef Slaoui has submitted his resignation at the request of the incoming Biden Covid team, under a plan that would see him stay in the role for a month to help with the transition, according to two people familiar with the situation. Though the initial vaccine rollout has been criticized, the speed of their development, which Slaoui oversaw, exceeded expectations, with two vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna approved for emergency use in the U.S. by the FDA.

> * The U.S. will soon require all airline passengers to prove they recently tested negative for Covid-19 before flying to the country, the CDC said Tuesday. The measure, which aims to curb the spread of the disease, comes as new infections hit records. The U.S. reported a record 4,327 daily Covid deaths Tuesday. Starting Jan. 26, arriving American citizens and foreign travelers will have to test negative for Covid-19 within three days of their flight to the U.S.

It all makes sense now... NIO X APPLE üöÄüöÄüöÄ,1.0,,2021-01-13 04:37:47
[Serious DD] TSMC - A Hidden Gem Offering Free Money,0.85,"# While there are many more companies that are discussed much more than TSMC (NYSE:TSM) on here, such as Apple, AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, etc, TSMC is a hidden gem that is getting ready to take off over the next few years. Here's why:

TSMC was founded in 1987 with the intent of bringing Taiwan into the global tech market. Morris Chang, who previously worked at Texas Instruments for over 30 years, is the founder and former CEO of TSMC and widely regarded as the ""godfather of computer chips"". TSMC is currently the world's largest semiconductor producer, with over half of semiconductor revenue from TSMC. Other notable competitors include GlobalFoundries (AMD used them for Zen and Zen+, switching to TSMC for Zen 2 and Zen 3), Intel, and Samsung. TSMC is a pioneer in the pure-play foundry business, meaning that they do not produce any chips for their own products. Instead, they manufacture and sell chips to companies, meaning that those who choose to source chips from TSMC do not have to build expensive silicon fabrication plants to manufacture their own chips. TSMC currently operates 10 different silicon fabs, manufacturing over 10,000 different products using over 250 distinct technologies to cater to 499 different customers in 2019.

Not only is TSMC the largest semiconductor foundry, it is also a pioneer in advancing semiconductor production and performance. Currently, TSMC has 7 customers for its new 5nm chips, including Apple, for A14/X chips and ARM-based chips for Mac products, Qualcomm and MediaTek for 5G smartphone chips, AMD, for next-generation Zen 4 CPUs, Bitmain, Intel, and NVIDIA. TSMC is also currently engineering its N4 chips, built on a 4nm process node, its 3nm chips, and its 2nm chips, which will use new GAAFET (Gate All Around Field Effect Transistor) technology instead of the traditional FinFET technology.

**So who are some of TSMC's biggest and most notable customers?**

# Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Apple is the world's largest company in terms of market capitalization (2.17 Trillion), and has become widely popular due to its heavy and cohesive integration between its products and widespread use by many prominent figures. Currently, it offers many products such as laptops, phones, smart watches, smart TV products, fitness products, and more. It also offers many services and software products, which all integrate with each other via iCloud, continuity software such as Handoff, and more. Recently, Apple has confirmed that they are cutting support for Intel CPUs on their Mac products in a few years, meaning they will shift to using entirely Apple Silicon chips for all of their Mac products. This is in addition to Apple using their own chips for all other products that they currently produce - iPhones, iPads, smart watches, etc.

Apple is one of TSMC's largest customers, and that is only expected to grow as they ramp up production for their M1 and next generation ARM chips for Macs. Apple's M1 chips are a strong competitor to AMD and Intel CPUs, especially if they can scale well up to 32 and 64 cores. They are extremely efficient and consume drastically less power than x86-based CPUs (Intel and AMD CPUs), meaning that thermal requirements are much lower. Macs have typically been targeted by PC enthusiasts as an overpriced, underperforming lineup, but we may see that change as Apple's new chips perform extremely well.

Apple reported a yearly revenue of 274.5 billion US Dollars in 2020, roughly a 5% increase from 2019. Since Apple relies on TSMC for their chips, and Apple's Mac lineup is likely to become more popular, I would expect that TSMC's revenue from Apple will increase more than we've seen in previous years.

# Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)

AMD has certainly made a huge return since Lisa Su became CEO in 2014 and the production of Ryzen, which was widely popular due to its high core counts and high price to performance compared to Intel. Now, Ryzen has developed into a strong all-around player, sporting high core counts and great single thread performance. Currently, AMD Ryzen 5000 desktop CPUs outperform Intel's current generation Comet Lake CPUs in games, which is the first time that AMD has surpassed Intel in gaming performance.

AMD has slowly been regaining market share, both in the PC enthusiast side and the server side. In the past two years, AMD has doubled their server market share from 4.5% to 8%. This may not seem like much, but considering that server upgrades are not frequent and those who buy Intel server CPUs are more likely to stick with Intel, that is a massive increase. On the PC enthusiast side, AMD CPUs have accounted for 84% of CPUs sold on mindfactory.de, a German PC Retailer. This is a massive increase considering that in 2016, before the release of Ryzen, Intel accounted for roughly 75% of CPU sales on mindfactory.de.

AMD launched their Zen 3 chips in 2020, which was followed by huge demand and a shortage of these CPUs. This was in part due to demand at TSMC not being able to keep up with AMD's orders. Zen 3 CPUs perform extremely well, and next-generation Zen 4 CPUs, which will be on TSMC's 5nm process, point to a shortage of fab space at TSMC.

# Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)

Qualcomm is a semiconductor company that creates wireless technology chips, CPUs, software, and services related to wireless technology. Their most prominent products include their Snapdragon CPUs, used in phones from some of the largest smartphone companies such as Samsung, LG, OnePlus, Xiaomi, Motorola, and more. They also produce application specific processors for things like cameras, IoT devices, kiosks, robots, and a lot more. Additionally, Qualcomm offers desktop CPUs, such as their Snapdragon 8cx. Qualcomm also produces various connectivity chips for things such as WiFi (onboard chips in laptops, desktop Wifi cards, routers, modems, etc), Bluetooth, and internet connectivity chips on smartphones.

Currently, Qualcomm relies on TSMC for the production of its Snapdragon chips. Although Samsung beat out TSMC for the production of Qualcomm's upcoming 5G chips, mobile chips accounted for 44.8% of Qualcomm's total revenue in 2020, while RF Front End chips (smartphone internet connectivity chips) accounted for just 9.8% of Qualcomm's total revenue.

# NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)

NVIDIA has been a long time customer of TSMC, dating all the way back to 1998 when NVIDIA switched over to TSMC's 350nm process for the Riva TNT. Since then, TSMC has manufactured nearly every NVIDIA chip up until RTX 3000 series, also known as Ampere. NVIDIA decided to switch to Samsung's 8N 8nm process node, likely due to financial reasons or fab capacity reasons.

However, NVIDIA is allegedly moving back to TSMC to manufacture more Ampere GPUs using their 7nm process. There could be a few reasons for this - TSMC might have offered NVIDIA a deal, or capacity for 7nm fabs may have opened up due to large customers such as Apple and AMD shifting more focus towards TSMC's 5nm process.

NVIDIA's RTX 3000 series GPUs, also known as Ampere, are a massive improvement in the GPU space compared to previous generations and just for performance in general. The RTX 3070 performs similarly to an RTX 2080ti, where the former has an MSRP of 499 USD and the latter has an MSRP of 999 USD. In addition to much greater price/performance, Ampere GPUs also heavily increase ray tracing performance so games that can take advantage of ray tracing hardware are actually playable. They are extremely popular, and currently Ampere GPUs are selling anywhere from 200 to upwards of 1500 dollars of their MSRP. NVIDIA is also huge in the AI/Computing space, teaming up with NIO for AI-based self-driving computation, Photoshop, for neural filters, and also  powers some of the fastest supercomputers in the world. In regards to AMD, NVIDIA blows the new RX 6000 series GPUs out of the water for things like streaming performance and workstation performance.

# Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)

While Intel has traditionally manufactured most of their products (Internet connectivity products, processors, chipsets, etc), Intel is reportedly shifting a fair amount of their chips to TSMC. Recently, Intel announced they would use TSMC for 7nm Xe graphics chips on their CPUs. In October of 2020, Intel CEO Bob Swan said Intel would decide by January whether it was going to expand its 7nm production, outsource it to a foundry, or both. Intel has severely underperformed in the CPU space compared to AMD, but if they decide to shift some production to TSMC, this could mean that Intel will make a strong return into the CPU space and strong entry into the GPU space.

# Cool, but what does this mean?

Again, TSMC is the largest foundry, outclassing the likes of Samsung, GlobalFoundries, and other similar companies. There is an insane amount of demand for TSMC's chips, and they are extremely competitive compared to other manufacturers. TSMC has customers such as Apple, AMD, and Qualcomm, which all have great products and are only expected to grow with the release of new technology such as CPUs or 5G networking. Many of its customers are expected to have massive growth over the coming years, meaning that TSMC will reap some of those profits.

# Ok, but why should I buy now?

I mean, TSMC is already up over 100% over the past year, isn't it too late to buy in?

When you consider its most important clients, all of them are going to use TSMC for future products that are important to their respective segments. Apple has just begun their venture into producing their own CPUs for Mac products, the release of DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 is right around the corner with AMD's Zen 4 processors, set to release late 2021 or 2022, Qualcomm producing next generation Snapdragon CPUs (and we may see 5G production shifted to TSMC), Intel actually producing competitive CPUs once again (which might be with TSMC), and NVIDIA continuing to dominate in the computing space and the GPU space. Considering that all of these things are happening in the next few years, TSMC is getting ready to take off.  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ

TL;DR: TSMC has a lot of very large customers (Apple, AMD, QualComm to name a few) which are all producing technology that looks very promising. All of these things are coming up in the future, which mean that TSMC is going to the moon. BUY CALLS AND LEAPS LET'S GOOOOOO

2023 a TSLA GME story,0.85,"Elon is a believer in gaming. He thinks that in autonomous vehicles, entertainment is crucial and that gaming is the most preferred form of entertainment.

[The first hint](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1343608530998153222)

At this point in time, TSLA will be . . . well the same, huge and in a class of its own (sorry NIO).

GME will be fully recovered and have shifted into mobile gaming (phones, cars, busses, trains, planes, waiting rooms, not quite in the age of functional contact lens entertainment . . .).

We can only hope to imagine what the sit down between Elon and RC would entail.  My best guess is that they meet for a private game of battleship (Elon not a big fan of chess) wearing short shorts.  Out of respect, RC only lets one nut dangle out of his shorts so that Elon can have the two nut seniority.

They realize VR is out of the question - too many lawsuits, but then realize they can just add bullshit to the terms and conditions and go full VR.  I'm talking VR racing (ironic isn't it), VRcations to Ibiza, and unfortunately the dreaded VR work meeting.

Some less innovative but nearly as rich asshole companies, will immediately hop on board to milk the bonus productivity from its employees.  Think about it, company cars that take employees to and from home, meetings, conferences, etc. that track in vehicle activity.  This pressures employees to work from the car as often as possible, and the best part for the company is the car drives itself back after dropping off said employee at home.  Every large company will be forced to order their own tesla work vehicle fleet to compete with the productivity.

XPEV TO THE MOON!!! CHINA BACKS EV STARTUP XPEV WITH 2 BILLION!!!,0.78,"Alright bros,

The next move has been found. Chinese electric car company XPENG (ticker XPEV) secured a 2 billion dollar loan from the Chinese government. XPEV is backed by Alibaba, and the loans secured were also given to NIO and Tesla.

This is huge - The Chinese government will clearly want Chinese companies to succeed in the global EV (electric vehicle) market. They‚Äôd be fools to just back NIO with the hopes that NIO is the one (you don‚Äôt get the reference? You‚Äôre a üåàüêª)

Keep in mind, when NIO tanked to a $1.50 they were able to pop off significantly because they secured a billion dollar loan from the Chinese government. 

What the $2 billion from the Chinese govt means is that they‚Äôll continue to provide even more money, and will not let XPEV fail. XPEV is connected to the CCP, and IPO‚Äôd Aug 26, 2020. Hasn‚Äôt even been a full year since IPO - can you imagine what it‚Äôll be by this August, let alone 5 years from now? A 2 billion dollar loan is a huge sign of confidence from the CCP, and they run China.

Also, XPEV never tanked like NIO, stocks simply corrected from a short burst up. It‚Äôs up 20% today on the news, but will prolly hit ATH fast and üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ after.

Another day, another EV play. TSLA and NIO are both examples of EV companies that have capitalized on the gains resulting from being early to the party for electric cars.


Awesome. But there is a whole other dimension to the automobile industry other than cars that HAS NOT been electrified yet, and that this company has a first-mover advantage on (just like NIO and TSLA did): **The medium-heavy duty vehicles.**

Today, I present you with an opportunity to be early to this party featuring the sleeping giant that is:

#LION ELECTRIC ($NGA)

It is currently trading under the SPAC ticker $NGA with a merger completion set for the end of Q1. 

**That‚Äôs right, by buying 1 share of $NGA right now, you are effectively buying 1 share of Lion Electric.** 

Let me preface this post by saying that [Lion Electric](https://thelionelectric.com/en) has been working on their vehicles, battery technology, and charging grids since 2010 and ALREADY HAS VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. So no, they are not some shambolic ponzi scheme of an EV company (looking at you NKLA). In fact, it literally has the [largest fleet of electified school buses](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/largest-zero-emission-school-bus-fleet-in-north-america-bolstered-by-10-bus-delivery-from-lion-electric-301194935.html#:~:text=The%20Lion%20Electric%20Co.&amp;amp;amp;text=With%20these%20new%20buses%2C%20Twin,school%20buses%20in%20its%20fleet.) on the road in North America as we speak.

#*So why haven't I FUCKING heard about this ""Lion Electric"" company?*

Simple answer: it's a Canadian company located in Quebec. No company outside of 'Murica or China can be of interest right? ***RIGHT????*** Well, the EV credits and subsidies in Quebec are fucking great, but other than that you are right for once, idiot. The good thing is that it ain't gonna be Canadian-based much longer. Lion is going to reveal its new U.S. manufacturing facility any day now, rumored to be in [Michigan](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-lion-electric-co-to-deliver-michigans-first-11-electric-school-buses-as-part-of-the-volkswagen-mitigation-settlement-300917333.html) where it delivered the state's first ever 100% electric school buses. Lion Electric, in fact, are already [registered as a business](https://michigan-company.com/co/the-lion-electric-co-usa-inc) in Michigan. Oh, and it just so happens that the rumored factory location is right in between two Amazon factories, and is not a mere coincidence (see more below on why this is pertinent). Anyhow, their future clearly lies in the United States, and they are uplisting as LEV on the NYSE when the [merger](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210104005149/en/Northern-Genesis-Acquisition-Corp.-Announces-Filing-by-The-Lion-Electric-Company-of-a-Preliminary-Registration-Statement-on-SEC-Form-F-4-in-Connection-With-Their-Proposed-Business-Combination) with NGA closes in March, as per the CEO. Seriously, look at how many job listings are posted across America by Lion Electric by clicking [here](https://emploislion.com/en/jobs).



#*So, why the actual FUCK should I care?* 


**Because fucking Jeff Bezos and Joe Biden care, idiot.** 


News silently broke last week that **AMAZON** has come to an agreement to purchase up to 500 of Lions class-6 and class-8 delivery trucks per year from 2021-2025 (or up to 2500 over 5 years). Emphasis on 'silently' because this company, unlike many, lets their results do the talking rather than a PR team of slimy fuckers. Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention that Amazon has the option to purchase at least **2500 trucks per year (conservative number), or 1.1b worth** for the five years following 2025, with a possibility of acquiring up to [15.8% of the company](https://stnonline.com/news/school-bus-production-to-benefit-from-amazon-agreement-lion-electric/). 

**Yup. Amazon are in bed with Lion Electric, and you should be too.** 

And, before anyone asks, the Tesla semi-truck serves entirely different purposes. No point in comparing apples to oranges. Tesla's truck is specialized for a single purpose: long distance delivery from warehouse to retail. **The Lion-8 and Lion-6 delivery trucks are much more versatile, will be used by Amazon to deliver between Amazon's facilities, and most importantly they are ready for MASS SCALE PRODUCTION**. So no, idiot, they are not competing against the Tesla semi and will fill different voids in the market. [See here how diversified their truck lineup really is.](https://imgur.com/nJiXzp8)

#*And what about Joe Biden?* 

**Sleepy Joe and his Clean Energy Plan have vowed to [electrify 500,000 school buses](https://thenextweb.com/shift/2020/11/14/what-bidens-environmental-plans-mean-for-electric-vehicles-syndication/) over the next 4 years**

NO COMPANY is better positioned to take a huge piece of that pie than Lion Electric. If that seems like a stretch to you, consider this: the CEO of Lion, Marc Bedard, will be speaking at a virtual event on the future of E-mobility this Wednesday (Jan 13), [where the Co-chair of Biden's Infrastructure Committee will be in attendance](https://my.demio.com/ref/vFksZ11nZGvHsaxG). Allow me to show you what the Lion Electric buses look like, and what their clients think of them, highlighted by [this fine gentleman](https://youtu.be/StpnGrItO4E?t=46) from California labelling them as the **Rolls Royce and Tesla of school buses**. 

I‚Äôm sure many of you will be aware of the merger completed today with Proterra, another electric bus manufacturer. Awesome right? [A real shame that, in their investors presentation, they did not compare their revenue projections to Lion's past the year 2021, as they would've admitted to being second best.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820630/000121390021001584/ea133141ex99-2_arclight.htm?fbclid=IwAR0X17En3iZX-fZhuNAneJG2lDvOX_pT-OcKlXVbKWmnAMFtuNbUsrqA4M0) 


**Proterra are also exclusively a bus play, while Lion expects nearly 90% of its revenue by 2024 to be from trucks. In fact, Lion's revenue from their trucks ALONE in 2024 is projected to trump Proterra's entire revenue in 2025.**

Anyhow, none of these companies have anywhere near the capacity to electrify 25% of the American school bus fleet by themselves in 4 years. So I assure you that Lion will be providing buses to Biden over the next 4 years, as will Proterra probably, since there are only 3 players that are READY in the industry to be in on this.



#*Why should I be buy RIGHT FUCKING NOW?*

**Because tomorrow may very well be the last chance to get in $NGA under 30$.**

Jim Cramer is inviting Marc (the CEO) onto **Mad Money** [TOMORROW](https://i.redd.it/ucl54g5avaa61.jpg) after it was initially scheduled last week, but the events in Washington forced a postponement. A blessing in disguise for everyone really, and a final chance to get in before this it takes off. NGA is still trading at a measly 1B valuation, with Amazon ALONE forecasted to purchase more than 1b worth of trucks per year come 2025. Marc is going to pump the tits out of Lion on Mad Money, and Cramer is going to eat all of it up, as this company is the real deal. 

**How do I know $NGA will get its tits pumped?** The CEO of Lion featured on a [local news podcast](https://www.fm93.com/audio/361623/marc-bedard-pdg-de-lion-amazon-dispose-a-acheter-des-camions-du-producteur-quebecois?fbclid=IwAR1N4Kr0eX-nLjr2-VThUCUVcGIwRlL0ZpC7Abpic7fQY7In4BbJqz7Y7jE) last week and boasted about the Amazon deal as well as their advantage over competition in electrifying buses and trucks, **comparing Lion to Tesla in the process**. Unfortunately, he said all of this in French, which I'm sure none of you idiots understand. But once he regurgitates it all in English to Jim Cramer, the significant deal with Amazon and its similarities to Tesla in its infancy are sending this üöÄüåöüöÄ. 

**Oh yeah, and, by the way, the last time Cramer hosted a CEO from an up and coming EV merger acquisition (CIIC), that stock went from 21$-37$ in the two following trading sessions.**

"Want a bubble-less EV play, NVDA to the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄ",0.92,"All right retards listen up,
this market clearly shows that EV's are the future and TSLA will be dominate along with a few asian knockoffs (NIO & XPEV).

These companies are all heavily pursuing automated driving.
TSLA being the leader in the field uses their own chips (although they used NVDA chips up to 2018) while XPEV and more recently NIO are using the NVDA chips.

If any other one of these dumb fuckass 0 revenue EV companies want a chance to compete with these 3 in AI driving, they will be using NVDA chips.

They also make massive data center revenue from the cloud computing chips they designed for AWS which is the network that runs most of the fucking world right now.

NFLX, SPOT, ABNB, WORK, and countless other companies have almost all of their data on AWS.
Oh, and the mother fucking CIA databases are on AWS as well as most of the data for the new CCP digital yuan. 

This is without mentioning the deal they have set up to acquire ARM which is the main processing chip for almost every smartphone.

Additionally, NVDA has been consolidating for about 3 months, is not overvalued like almost anything else on the market (less market cap than TSLA with much better financials) and is perfectly positioned to dominate the next 10 years. This is just the beginning üöÄüöÄüöÄ.

"Stock Market News for Today |LMND, NIO, WMT, JNJ, AFRM IPO & other Stock Market News [01-12]",0.89,"**Stocks give up gains from last week. Lemonade has a wild ride, while NIO shines again. Is JNJ the best vaccine play? Let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market giving up some of the last week gains, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/9ZpCqXy) losing 1.25%, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/HGrtWgk) losing 0.66% and the [Dow Jones Industrial](https://ibb.co/1z21KR2) finishing down almost 90 points as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/fqwvn71) spiking again by more than 11%, thought it was even higher at the start of the day.

We saw more companies declining [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/8sr5bqw), but only saw 8 new lows, while the number of companies moving above the moving averages is still very high. We also saw only 3 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/HgZTxtj) finish the day in the green, with Energy in the lead, while Materials finished flat and Real Estate, Communications and Consumer Discretionary were the biggest losers dropping more than 1% as we saw mostly large-cap growth companies losing ground, with small & mid-caps outperforming yet again, continuing the [TREND](https://ibb.co/8x5m4cc) that can also be seen from the start of 2021.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/m9Jb0sS) from yesterday, you can see almost all big tech companies lost ground, with Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Netflix losing more than 2% while Tesla also lost almost 8% after an 11day winning streak. The biggest gains were made in the semiconductors & drug manufacturers.

[Today](https://ibb.co/Xp3hvr0) we get don‚Äôt get that much economic data, as we wait for more heavy days starting tomorrow.

In some other stock market news, we saw [LEMONADE](https://ibb.co/K7YV26k) take quite a ride again yesterday, going from barely down for the day, up to a huge gain of 14%, after the COO of the [COMPANY](https://ibb.co/9cCz2XD) went on Twitter and attacked the Seeking Alpha bearish articles on the company, only to later in after hours to announce they will [SELL](https://ibb.co/hYqJJHZ) shares again for corporate purposes. This is further testimony to the point I have been making in the past weeks, that companies are very incentivized to sell stock to raise capital or even for the management of the company to realize some gains. I really like Lemonade and will hold them for the long-term, but after a 200% increase in the past couple of [MONTHS](https://ibb.co/Dp1csg0), I trimmed my positions in the company by selling out the cost basis and letting the profits run, though I might add to this position if a significant pullback or correction appears.

Moving on, we also saw [WALMART](https://ibb.co/pL18LYP) being the latest company that is planning to make a pus in the fintech world. This is really nice news to hear from the company, as they try to diversify their revenue stream even more, while they are also trying to compete more & more with Amazon in the online retail business.

In the hardware technology [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/b6S6yKn), we saw Apple gaining some market share of the global PC shipments which has seen an overall 13% increase in 2020, the biggest such spike since 2010. I think Apple has room to grow this market share even more with the continuing improvements and adopting of their latest in-house chips.

We also saw some developments in the health care world, with JNJ‚Äôs vaccine [EXPECTED](https://ibb.co/LC4Qsgp) to deliver results by the end of the month, keep in mind this is my favorite vaccine play, with their vaccine only needing 1 shot and not requiring such extreme storage conditions like the Pfizer & Moderna ones, while also being expected to have better results than AstraZeneca‚Äôs vaccine.

Also, Eli [Lilly](https://ibb.co/Y8t0gm2) delivered some promising results on their Alzheimer‚Äôs study, which led the stock to have a big pop yesterday.

And in the IPO world we will have [AFFIRM](https://ibb.co/tbdgmjP) Holdings on the deck, as we found out that the fintech Affirm will start its IPO price from at least $41, but it‚Äôs really hard to believe shares will reach the market for retail traders under $60-$70.

And one last piece of news, exactly like I told you yesterday, [NIO](https://ibb.co/Wv8nRpy) opened higher on the huge hype after the NIO Day, almost touching 67$ before dropping to under 63$ to finish the day, only to [DROP](https://ibb.co/dpzHh7Q) even more after hours, before recovering today in pre-market. It‚Äôs a wild ride with this company. I see some short-term downside, but long-term upside for this company.

So, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the markets as I think there is a significant possibility that with this new stimulus checks, we might see another increase in stock trading from people who are receiving these checks. Last [TIME](https://ibb.co/sFWcyRp) around securities trading was one of the top ways that money was used in most of the income brackets. Today the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/FBxg7s8) Markets are pretty flat and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/s22g9Pb) are mixed, with the Dow slightly down, while the Nasdaq is leading the way.

August 2021.,0.86,"Its Monday, 2nd August 2021. PLTR has hit 19 after trading in the low teens for months, while TSLA is now 3000 and steel companies have hit new ATHs. You've lost half your account on TSLA puts and PLTR calls. You don't have any steel stocks because the other half is in GME shares, bought at 20.50 since Ryan Cohen and his best buds joined the board of directors.

But apart from news of GME pulling out of ICR, there hasn't been any news from GME since January and its now trading at 12 bucks a share. You hear a noise behind and and turn around to see your wife and her boyfriend pointing and laughing at you before they go into her bedroom and close the door.

Dejected, you sell your GME shares and head over to [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) to find some boomer stock that pays you 5 bucks a year in dividends.

While browsing, you get a notification about a new tweet from Ryan, the man himself. Its a singular rocket emoji with a link to GameStop's website. Curious, you click the link.

""Gamestop is now pleased to announce that it is now the sole and official distributor of Corsair products, NVIDIA cards, and AMD CPUs. We have also partnered with Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo to be the only distributor of their games and consoles. We have developed technology to stop bots from scalping new hardware. With these new partnerships, GameStop will be the world's first and only company dedicated solely to gamers. Also we are the only official North American dealer for Nio.""

You check RobinHood. GME has now exploded to 10,000 a share, Ryan Cohen has surpassed Elon Musk as the richest man on Earth and Mars, and you get a message from your dad apologizing for doubting you and how he can't wait to tell the family at Christmas.",2021-01-12 11:10:00
Let's look at ICLN and the Clean Energy Market's very near future,0.94,"The [iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ICLN?p=ICLN&.tsrc=fin-srch) is pretty much the most popular Clean Energy ETF right now. Why? Because it's going to the fucking moon with this administration. Here's why.

&#x200B;

A democratic President, Senate, and Congress are all taking office soon. The Biden administration had already publicized their plans for climate change and Clean Energy back before the election, saying ""[Biden will make a $2 trillion accelerated investment, with a plan to deploy those resources over his first term, setting us on an irreversible course to meet the ambitious climate progress that science demands.](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/)"" Our man Biden is literally pumping money into climate action, which will include a variety of benefits for the entire Clean Energy industry.

&#x200B;

Now, even more interesting, is that in the same article, the administration also says they plan to ""move ambitiously to generate clean, American-made electricity to achieve a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035. This will enable us to meet the existential threat of climate change while creating millions of jobs with a choice to join a union.""

&#x200B;

Let's look at the numbers from [eia.gov](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3) based on the most recent (2019) statistics:

&#x200B;

|Energy Source|Billion kWh|Share of Total %|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Total - All Sources|4127|100.0%|
|Fossil Fuels (total)|2582|**62.6%**|
|Natural Gas|1586|^(38.4%)|
|Coal|965|^(23.4%)|
|Petroleum|18|^(0.4%)|
|Other Gases|13|^(0.3%)|
|Nuclear|809|^(19.6%)|
|Renewables (total)|728|**17.6%**|
|Wind|295|^(7.1%)|
|Hydropower|288|^(7.0%)|
|Solar|72|^(1.7%)|
|Biomass (total)|58|**1.4%**|
|Wood|39|^(0.9%)|
|Landfill gas|10|^(0.3%)|
|Municipal solid waste|6|^(0.1%)|
|Other biomass|2|^(0.1%)|
|Geothermal|15|^(0.4%)|
|Pumped storage Hydropower|\-5|^(-0.1%)|
|Other Sources|13|^(0.3%)|

&#x200B;

Looking at the numbers from 2019 relative to the 15 year target for the US energy sector, the entire Renewables sector will need to grow at an average rate of \~5% annually for the next 15 years in order to meet that target.

&#x200B;

Does that mean your stonks are only growing 5% annually? No, because 5% never got anyone to the moon. [5% of the US Energy Sector is equivalent to $17.5 Billion annually](https://www.selectusa.gov/energy-industry-united-states#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20International%20Energy,%2Dlargest%20in%20the%20world). That doesn't include the massive amounts of jobs that will be produced as the Clean Energy market rapidly develops. That also doesn't include the additional trillions of dollars that the coming administration intends to continue pumping out.

&#x200B;

The next big thing to look forward to is Biden's Inaugural Address, where I expect significant mentions of his plan to handle climate change and boost clean energy. Following that of course will be all of the big moves to pass this initial $2 trillion bill.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Are you thinking that ICLN doesn't have enough exposure to the EV market to ride along with TSLA and NIO?

Take a look at [First Trust Clean Edge Green Energy Index (QCLN)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QCLN?p=QCLN&.tsrc=fin-srch). It has maintained significant holdings in both NIO and TSLA throughout this wild ride.

Still not convinced to dump your life savings into Clean Energy?

Maybe check out [Invesco Global Clean Energy (PBD)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PBD?p=PBD&.tsrc=fin-srch). It's got great diversity within the Clean Energy sector, without concentrating too much on any single stock.

Miss out on NIO? Electric Scooter NIU DD to the üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ,0.35,"Any WSB guys miss on NIO?

No worries, NIU is here to help!

What is NIU? They offer electric scooters and electric motorcycles such as this one:

[Nqi GT motorcycle](https://preview.redd.it/uk0gpww3xta61.png?width=1560&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f10ffe91a7b6ce611b97006f5a09b0092037d1d)

&#x200B;

[Okay seems like they're selling more scooters.](https://preview.redd.it/5p1g64oo0ua61.png?width=2915&format=png&auto=webp&s=d852fa029fc7a93c11d6947849005f289f98a679)

Unlike some of the SPAC plays, they are actually selling scooters that people are driving! And making an electric scooter is probably a lot easier than making an electric car just based on weight and speed.

Quick stats:

2.73B mkt cap, 122.96 P/E ratio, and a 12 month forward PEG ratio of 4.35. Seems slightly overvalued but it's electric who cares.üöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄ

[Revenue going up, consistently every year, earnings went positive 2019. Green thing getting longer! Blue thing should follow green thing. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ](https://preview.redd.it/tcrlpd2dxta61.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac4780ad368a36bb1b5826a7c06869e255abdbd8)

I personally think electric scooters would be in demand in urban areas especially as pandemic uncertainty keeps reoccurring. Normally people own less cars in urban areas, especially ones that are so crowded like China which NIU is based in. I for one am trying to buy a econobox Japanese used car so I don't have to use public transport anymore, and most people seem to be thinking similarly with used car prices going through the roof.

I think electric scooters would be a great solution for Chinese cities since they already have so many bikes and scooters.

But don't take my word for it, their annual scooter sale increased 43% from 2019 to 2020. üöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄ

The risks I see is dollar rising, their EPS is inconsistent, and that now would be buying at a slight premium.",2021-01-12 04:42:04

I truly believe that EV will be a massive market, and I wanted to consolidate a bunch of companies into a single place that I could look at and analyze which would be the biggest winners. The result is a massive spreadsheet of 49 companies and ETFs that are in the Clean Energy/EV space. Sample companies include:

\- LAC

\- ENPH

\- ICLN

Weekly Update: Selling the most popular options contracts on Reddit 1/15 EXP,0.85,"I am back this week with some really interesting data to share.  As expected the amount of stocks / contracts picked up massively from last week. For the expiration of 1/15/21 there were 838 contracts  and 1826 mentions of these contracts.  Compared to last week this is a huge jump and really something to talk about.

For those that are new here is a quick introduction: I have been analyzing comments and posts on reddit to determine what stocks/contracts are mentioned the most. This week I am looking at the options contracts that have been mentioned on the subreddits we track. Specifically, I am looking at contracts expiring this Friday 1/15/2021. The data collected for this analysis was collected from 1/1 ‚Äì 1/8.

The goal here is to track what reddit is following and to see how reddit preforms. There is this notion that retail investors often fail to beat the market. This is why financial advisors recommend that you buy into the major ETF‚Äôs such as SPY. As historically there have been few people that manage to beat the major Index‚Äôs year over year. My hypothesis going into this week is that I should bet against the trends on reddit as typically the retail investor is wrong.

Current Results: 

1. Week 1: +$1710
2. Week 2: -$2610
3. Week 3: +$45

Total: -$855 

Though we are in the negative out of the 8 contracts our data suggested we sell 7 of them were profitable.  I think the loss so far is mostly attributed to position sizing, but thats something I will work on in the future. 

I just want to emphasize it does not matter if I am right or wrong. More importantly this research is to identify if there are any trends worth following. Please do not argue below that I am wrong or right this is research and I am sharing the results. 

# Call Data

* Out of 838 Contracts 648 are calls (77% Calls)
* 56% of the calls are out of the money
* The out of the money calls are on average 25% out of the money
* The in the money calls are on average 20% in the money (probably because of the huge pump last couple of weeks)

# Put Data 

* Out of 838 Contracts 175 are Puts (23%)
* 86% of the calls are out of the money
* The in the money puts are 25% in the money
* The out of the money puts are 29% out of the money 

Just based on the above data is is clear that reddit is leaning heavily bullish into the 1/15 expiration.

Deere and Co,0.87,"First DD so don‚Äôt piss on me please.

An agriculture manufacturer for those who don‚Äôt know, completely underrated stock, been buying and selling this since 130$.

Deere will be on display at CES 2021 and won an award for their X-Series combine. In the the most compulsory sector of the world: farming. Deere tractors are synonymous with quality in the US. Last September Ford‚Äôs Farley said he wants Ford to ‚ÄúRun like a Deere‚Äù. Farmers rely on their equipment for their livelihood, and the rest of us rely on them to farm shit and send it to us.

If you look at the chart for DE you‚Äôll notice it‚Äôs always green. John Deere tractors are green. Coincidence? Doubt it.

Reuters Stock Reports Plus gives DE a 9/10 which on par with Apple and other good shit. One of ARK‚Äôs portfolios has been buying it recently (ARKQ?) and I‚Äôve personally just doubled down and bought more. P/E is a relatively modest 33.8 and cash flow per share at 15.54, and a Reuters risk score of 10. Literally can‚Äôt go tits up. 

Earnings was beaten every quarter last year and Morgan Stanley have them at Overweight with a price target of 341 doll hairs. It‚Äôs actually a profitable company producing slabs of cash so it‚Äôs not in the radar for these 800 year old analysts to attack instead of retiring. SPEAKING OF it‚Äôs could be seen as a bit of a boomer stock since it‚Äôs been around forever and gives a little dividend (3.04$ PA) which doesn‚Äôt hurt either. The IV is lower than Trump‚Äôs IQ so it‚Äôs pretty unlikely that‚Äôs it‚Äôs going to be subject to major swings, the thing barely even moves premarket.

With the move to autonomous vehicles we can expect that at some point the agriculture industry is going to follow suit, with numerous extensions available for their equipment, the Deere‚Äôs are pretty close to driving themselves and last year a fully autonomous tractor concept was unveiled. This will save farmers zillions of hours of work.

"Stock Market News for Today | NIO Stock News | DKNG, PENN & other Stock Market News [01-11]",0.86,"**Stocks finish at all time highs to close out the first trading week of 2021. What is my opinion on the NIO stock after their latest event? DraftKings & PENN soar after the latest New York developments, let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of Friday as we saw the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/zr3x08Q) leading the way up over 1% and finished the week 2.4% up, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/9ghJQfk) also gaining more than half a percent on Friday and 1.8% for the week while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/w4Xrnvk) rose by 56 points and finished 1.6% higher in the first week of 2021, with all 3 big indexes finishing at new all-time highs. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/vdYffjm) dropping below 22 again, despite a mid-day spike, as the volatility index dropped more than 23% since the high on [Tuesday](https://ibb.co/C8xQvsN).

We saw an average [DAY](https://ibb.co/VTPKM80) of trading to close out the week, with average volume and an almost equal number of companies that were advancing compared to the declining ones, as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/gDFHxLf) finished in the green, with consumer Discretionary & Real Estate Leading the way, while the more value heavy industries lagged. For the week though, Energy outperformed, rising by more than 9%, Technology finished flat despite a very bad start to the week after the Georgia election and Real Estate lagged behind, losing 2.5% for the week, as we saw Large-Cap growth companies outperform on [Friday](https://ibb.co/b24dvCn), but in this fresh 2021, small & mid-caps have outperformed.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/G0YW732) from Friday, with big gainers coming mostly in the consumer cyclicals, with Tesla, Alibaba & MercadoLibre posting big gains, while the biggest losers were in the gold industry.

In [THIS](https://ibb.co/MBH11mV) short year though, we can see the huge outperformance of the Energy Sector, the Banks and some other names like Tesla & TSM.

We also got some economic data, with the latest Redfin report showing a 13% increase in home sale [PRICES](https://ibb.co/HV9CqQg) over 2020, as [ACTIVE](https://ibb.co/5nwRLMB) listings of homes for sales keeps on dropping. The listings have seen a 32% decrease since last year to a new all-time low, though, the average sale to list [PRICE](https://ibb.co/vcX1Jpw) ratio finally declined to 99.3%, as the housing market was red hot since June.

While December nonfarm payroll [declined](https://ibb.co/GT72GvR) by 140K, worse than then 75k gains expected and is the first month since April that brings jobs losses with most of the [JOBS](https://ibb.co/hKwgGqN) losses coming from the leisure and hospitality business which has been hit hard again, losing almost half a million jobs, while the unemployment rate did inch lower to 6.7%.

So, this week pretty much starts of the [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/7GPMmkJ) season again, with the most interesting ones for me being, Aphria as a read on the cannabis sector, Delta Airlines for a read on how the Airlines are recovering and JP Morgan on Friday, while on the economic front we will see a lot of interesting [DATA](https://ibb.co/X5FVfBB), mostly starting on Wednesday with the Consumer price index and the Federal Budget, while we continue these with the jobless claims on Thursday and more numbers about the economy on Friday.

This week we will also have some [IPOs](https://ibb.co/HKJXY8K) with the most interesting coming from Affirm Holdings, while I really expect to see what Biden [SAYS](https://ibb.co/rpTRtKN) on Thursday as this may be key to a further stimulus or fiscal package.

So, NIO [DAY](https://ibb.co/MBB053y) came and left me with rather somewhat of a disappointment, though I don‚Äôt expect most investors to really look at this, so they will probably jump on the stock again this week, so here is a quick recap of what they announced and what is my opinion on NIO:

They announced the first flagship sedan mode, the ET7 which will be [AVAILABLE](https://ibb.co/0jkgfTm) in 2 trim levels with 70 or 100KW battery starting from around $70K and $78K, but the good thing about NIO, and their main competitive advantage is the battery as a service. So, they will make this new sedan available for the same price with either battery pack if you do use the BAAS model at a price of $58K.

They also announced the next gen battery swap stations that can do over 300swaps/day, more than 3x the capability of the current one, as they also plan to build another 400 stations that would bring them to a total of almost 600 by the end of the year.

The ‚Äúnew battery technology‚Äù that they announced was the actual thing that disappointed me. So, they announced a 150KW battery with a claimed range of over 600miles, but that should be in perfect conditions, so expect the actual range to be somewhere in 400mile range, pretty much in line with Tesla‚Äôs current capabilities. The Launch [DATE](https://ibb.co/9WK8dJW) for the car is still only Q1 2022 while for the ‚ÄúNew Solid-State battery‚Äù the timeline is for it to be available by the end of 2022. So, the bad thing is that everything is still at least 1 year away and we have to see if the claimed range for the new battery is real.

And there are a couple of big warning signs here with the new battery technology, they actually avoided saying they designed, created or engineered this new tech battery, by saying they will [ADOPT](https://ibb.co/dDDpkm5) this new technology. So, it seems they will adopt this new technology from their current battery supplier CATL. This is an issue as this battery will be available to other manufacturers like Hyundai, Mercedes BMW will get their hands on, so this will not actually be something innovative, ground-breaking or a proprietary solution.

Also, I don‚Äôt know how big this new Sedan thing is, because the Sedan market is really dying around the world. This new ET7 isn‚Äôt competition for TESLA 3, it‚Äôs targeted for competition against the model S, which is already a dying segment as you can see from Tesla‚Äôs [SALES](https://ibb.co/smr7vNN).

But on some more positive news, they did announce something better in my opinion, with their Self-Driving Feature, [INCLUDING](https://ibb.co/ss65yw6)11 8megapixel cameras, as their collaboration with [Nvidia](https://ibb.co/C5bNBGK) will produce a super-computer that will generate up to 8Gigabyte/s of data, with the Nvidia CORE estimated to be 7x better than Tesla‚Äôs current computer. Though [THIS](https://ibb.co/M61cLRm) doesn‚Äôt have an official release date and will probably come with the ET7 next year, so, another disappointment as this comp against Tesla will not be a huge advantage once Tesla does upgrade their computers as well.

So, for short the main competitive advantages that [NIO](https://ibb.co/3c5Q80j) has right now are that they use the subscription model for both the battery swap technology and for the full-self driving feature which costs around $100/month. This is are very good and smart recurring revenue streams, as they make the entry price for the car much lower and also provide a stable flow of revenues. But‚Ä¶ I am disappointed in the ‚Äúnew battery technology‚Äù and have to wait for more developments. If this is a common technology that will be used by other car manufacturers, this is effectively not that big of a deal, but if somehow this is their own technology, that would possibly have better implications for the company. So, guys, I own both Tesla & NIO, and I think I might hold off right now on buying any more due to different factors. I think that Tesla has a good future, but this huge run-up has made it a good target for 10-20% correction at any point in the short-term future, while for NIO I expect this to rise in the next couple of days, and I am waiting for it to cool off a little before adding any more to my position. So, yeah, short-term I think both of them have some downside risk, but in the long run, I expect Tesla to trade at over $1000 and NIO to trade over $100.

In some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zJwMGgq), we saw gambling stocks like DraftKings and PENN rising on Friday after New York filed bills to legalize online betting in the state. [DraftKings](https://ibb.co/N2sDnH6) also just announced they will bring new stuff like drone racing betting, which is mind-blowing, that they are extending into such things. This is a continuing trend in the US and should be watched for future developments, as gambling will be legalized pretty much all over the US in the near future I believe, and I also expect this sector to be joined by the pot [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/Sf97NmW), even if it‚Äôs really hard to believe there will be a nationwide bill to legalize it, I expect there will be some improvements for the sector, and companies like Aphria which are closer to profitability should benefit from this.

On some more sad new, we also saw a 27-year-old Boeing plane [crash](https://ibb.co/dg9yW5j) in Indonesia, this is very sad news, but as the stock market goes, this issue seems to be unrelated to [Boeing](https://ibb.co/bJwt3Lt) right now. Indonesia has seen the most deaths in the past decades, with over 104 accidents, as this country is known for bad maintenance, pilot training and air-traffic controls problems.

And don‚Äôt forget, as I said in my earlier posts, don‚Äôt jump on these high-flying small cap stocks at all-time highs, this is a very good moment for this companies to raise cheap capital by issuing shares, with the latest example being [BLNK](https://ibb.co/pbG62F6).

So, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/f9RV9NM) are pointing to a bad open right now, with all 3 big index futures down, as the DOW futures are down over 200 points

Maybe people don't realize it, but along with the chips that NVDA will be providing, the AI provided by NVDA is crucial. Autonomous driving relies heavily on AI, and data is currently the most valuable asset in the world. 

Looking at some TA, NVDA has been consolidating in a flat base pattern (weekly chart) for several weeks now. The flat base pattern was formed on low volume, and there hasn't been much institutional distribution from the stock. It's basically been waiting for a catalyst to explode and this should be it.

Of course, NVDA options are expensive as shit so I'm looking at shorter-term otm options with decent volume to buy at market open. I really like the 2/19 $600 strike ($7.90/contract) or 3/19 $700 strike ($4.50/contract). If you're not broke like me then close-to-ITM options for about any date should work.

We will either have to drop the subculture and become highly moderated, (basically, memes + r/options) or get axed.  

Just today that guy, who posted a highly suspicious post about Nio went all over reddit blaming WSB for racism (yeah, the sub that basically worships Lisa Su is somehow racist against Asians now). We all know how this can escalate. Easier mental gymnastics was used to ban uncomfortable subs.  

I address this question to the mods and the general community. Do we have a plan for this scenario? Discord is fine, but no adequate discussion is possible there. And Discord isn‚Äôt exactly a stronghold of free speech.  

IDK what can it be. Signal? Telegram? (my personal favorite: they fought and won censorship in Iran, Belarus and Russia. If I got it right, Russia literally blocked half of the internet trying to ban them). 4Chan? Mastodon? Separate web forum?

Maybe we adopt to whatever the new rules are? Or we just go on with blazing guns until the music ends?  

I know similar topics were raised earlier, but it seems that the whole situation is evolving and having some guidance regarding the future of the sub would be much appreciated.",2021-01-10 22:28:13

"For anybody looking to buy NIO, BABA, etc.",0.54,"This weekend has seen an increase of pump posts for various Chinese stocks. I advise for anybody considering these positions to watch a documentary called The China Hustle. I'm surprised that this documentary isn't talked about more often on this sub, but it lays out the reasons as to why investing in these companies is a bad idea. The documentary itself does take liberties to make things more dramatic than they seem, but at the end of the day it does bring up points to be considered when it comes to Chinese stocks.

NIO is upsetting our almighty father. ELON please forgive me.,0.74,"NIO is disrupting Tesla's show. The spotlight is moving to NIO.

NIO has officially announced today a groundbreaking upcoming battery option for its electric cars - **150 kWh** battery packs, consisting of ultra-high energy density solid state cells. These are set for 2022. The NIO ET7 will be equipped with the 150 kWh battery, and will be able to go more than 1,000 km (620 miles). The ET7 also is said to have 7 times as much computing power as Tesla's vehicles.

The EV automaker also released a new charging station in addition to the 150 kWh battery and the Tesla rivaling sedan.  The Power Swap Station 2.0 is Nio's next-gen power swap station and can accommodate 13 batteries, boosting capacity by three times, with a daily capacity of up to 312 swaps.

It facilitates automatic parking of cars into the station, with one tab on the central display.

Nio said it sees its 500 power swap stations as being operable by the end of 2021.

This upcoming week will be very beneficial for us investors that are faithful to EV companies. I look forward to seeing its growth and seeing my money make its way out of our atmosphere.",2021-01-10 19:23:05

The United States is the world‚Äôs single largest economy (at market exchange rates), accounting for almost 22 percent of global output and over a third of stock market capitalization. It is prominent in virtually every global market, accounting for about one-tenth of global trade flows, one-fifth of global FDI stock, close to one-fifth of remittances, and one-fifth of global energy demand. Since the U.S. dollar is the most widely used currency in global trade and financial transactions, changes in U.S. monetary policy and investor sentiment play a major role in driving global financing conditions.

there has been a lot of news activity this weekend that could provide opportunities this week.  I have not been lurking on all posts so i probably missed a couple.

5 high-growth themes and the stock-market ETFs that can deliver big gains in 2021,0.78,"[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-high-growth-themes-and-the-stock-market-etfs-that-can-deliver-big-gains-in-2021-11609952097?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-high-growth-themes-and-the-stock-market-etfs-that-can-deliver-big-gains-in-2021-11609952097?mod=home-page)

For my ICLN friends

The most established ETF to play this trend is the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF          [ICLN,](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ICLN?mod=MW_story_quote)which covers companies in every geography and in every segment of  alternative energy and boasts almost $5 billion in assets. Perhaps most  important, while it does have some plays with vague EV applications,  such as hydrogen fuel cell stock Plug Power          [PLUG,](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/PLUG?mod=MW_story_quote)it is indeed a play on alternative energy ‚Äî unlike the some funds, like the Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF         [PBW](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/PBW?mod=MW_story_quote)that roughly tripled last year thanks to boasting Nio          [NIO](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/NIO?mod=MW_story_quote)as a top holding.

If you want to play EVs, there are  plenty of ways to do that. But this iShares ETF is a broader play on  green energy that could do very well in 2021.

This makes all quants who kept yapping about how TSLA pricing action via option gamma squeeze will subside once it's included in S&P screech in horror. Who knew the meme stock can continue its action unabated? TSLA hits ATH almost everyday this week, closing Friday up 7.84% to $880. Unreal.

* For a succinct difference of Elon chan's prowess vs Bezos, refer to chart below:

Talks about new gigafactory and everyone wants to give him sick tax breaks to build in their city/state | Shops for new second HQ to give high paying white collar jobs but AOC and gang gets up on his ass in asking for tax breaks |

* Morning economic numbers: nonfarm payrolls once again looking terrible, with consensus at about 50k increase but instead saw a -140k Dec. This ends a 7-month streak of steady gains in recovery. No worry fam, if you've lived thru March 2020 lows you'll know that market doesn't give a fuck about employment #s until you go all-in on calls. US reports more than 4k covid deaths for the first time ever - refer to above on why market doesn't give a fuck.

* Flurries of behind-the-scene political actions are happening as the country moves on from Y'all Qaeda's storming of the capitol. A number of high-level admin officials from policy advisors to cabinet members have bailed the sinking ship that is this current administration. Chatters of invoking 25th amendment. Second impeachment. POTUS has stated that he will NOT attend the upcoming inauguration (who knew he's a gdamn snowflake?), after finally putting out a statement that an orderly transition will occur. 

* Psuedo-SJW social media companies and platforms have banned POTUS in tandem, conveniently doing so after the Dems have clinched both chambers of Congress and will likely sit on committees regulating them. No real movements from these actions yet, though TWTR is pulling back after it banned POTUS for 12 hours until he deleted the offending Tweet. TWTR closed the day down -1.62% to $51.48, after an intraday low of more than -2%.

* BA got a slap on the wrist with a 2.5 bil fine from the DOJ for killing non-Americans. About 10% of the fine goes to the US govt while about 500 mil goes to the families of the 346 people that died in the two 737 Max crash. Remaining (70%) amount goes to BA customers because let's face it, corporations are truly the ones really hurting. BA closed down -1.32% to $209.

* It's a solid day for many Chinese ADRs as as BABA and TCEHY escape Treasury's list of delisting stonk. BABA closed up 4% for the day at $236 while TCEHY closed up 5.61% to $76.89. NIO, the TSLA of China (or is it XPEV? or LI? find out in 1.5 years!) closed up big at 8.55% to almost $59, despite offering to sell 68m more shares last month at $39. Surely the US market isn't going to be China Hustled.

* Today's big movers: DDD and PLUG continues their wild rocket moves to the stratosphere as strong market sentiment continues. DDD closed up 2.48% to $23.54, after touching an intraday high of almost 10% earlier. PLUG closed up 13% to $53.78.

* PSTH, Ackman's brainchild SPAC flew almost 12% today on ZERO news but faded towards end of the day. PSTH gang collectively jizzed and made a mess of themselves. Will it be Stripe? (it's not) Chick-fil-A? (it's not) Bloomberg? (eh they sorta denied it) Subway? (please god no). Find out eventually sometime Q1 2021 as Bill continues to edge us. Seriously Bill, announce something amazing already because I'm up more than 20k on zero news and I'm tempted to sell. PSTH closed up 7.24% to $29.32.

* In WSB meme stock land, a new law is being formed where none of these gdamn stock can go up together on the same day. PLTR faded to flat of 0.80% after being up more than 3% during early mornings, whereas GME and MT both fade some more today after a decent run-up attempt this entire week. GME close the day down -2.16% to $17.69, while MT pulls back from a week's worth of solid gain at -2.7% to $24.83. WSB's new meme ETF ICLN had some profit taking happened much to the displeasure of people who fomo into the ETF this morning, not realizing the sea of red candles were not bullish indicators. ICLN close the day down slightly to -0.75% to $33.15. Funny enough, OTM monthly calls haven't pulled back that much due to the magic of IV.

* While initially red through out most of the day, the DOW reversed course and closed up 0.18% or 56 pts, S&P up 0.55% or 20 pts, Nasdaq up a solid 1% or 134 pts, and RUT closed flat at -0.25% or -5 pts. It's the weekend and WSB newcomers addicted to FDs will no doubt flood the weekend thread, constantly asking if their $700 portfolio (funded in part by the $600 stimulus) with OTM calls will be okay. Don't worry new fam, stonk only goes up.

Alcoholic weapons & $SAM Spreads,0.79,"good fuckin MORNING to all you glass brains out there, how we doin?  We eatin fresh warm tendies with elon after yesterday?  Or are we fomo'ing in and out of palantir putting bulletholes in our portfolios?

Regardless, i dont think i saw enough appreciation for the fact that the richest individual currently living priced one of his EV models for ***exactly*** $69,420.  What a time to be alive.  The torch has been fucking PASSED!  And to who, but our leader?  C'mon boys, we can pump it a little more for celebratory purposes and get Elon to 200B for a day.

Let's get down to business; it's time to get stupid wasted off twea's and truly's like our wives to cope with our losses.  Instead of buying that FD for Tesla next week, get one on Apple instead & spend the rest on a few cases of booze to drink while apple fucks you and then goes up 10 points.

The viral video of loser white guy getting fatality'd with a can of tea sent shockwaves through the meme community.  Saw a string of videos on tiktok of people dramatically opening a briefcase and pulling out a twisted tea like they're boutta air out the scene with a glizzy.  And that was just **ONE** of the chain of free advertising videos, made sometimes and reposted often by kids who *didn't/can't/don't* even drink TT or alcohol.  That girl on Twitter has posted multiple times about how this event already is and will continue to affect her work schedule for the coming month.

Alllll kinds of search trends exploded for ""Twisted Tea"" and ""Sam Adams"".  Someone posted a week or so ago with screenshots of different explosive search trends, tried finding that post and their account but failed at both (like most things in life).  EDIT‚Äîu/Altruistic_report105 posted it 3 days ago, fuckin go nuts n look at the good data he posted.

Not to mention the fact that Sam Adams is a high volume stock, trading healthily at almost exactly a grand a share, and they **fucking murdered** their last two earnings.  They crushed 2019 in sales & are currently set up by meme power and alcoholics normalizing their problems to kill another earnings report, coming 2/17 after hours.  

Why is the meme power so important?  Why is this sudden late boost in sales so important?

**Because the dusty old millionaire shareholders aren't on social media and have no clue about the true potential because they play sudoku on paper and thus aren't pricing in the coming action.**

I'm not saying that Sam Adam's doing good is gonna be news to them; but every single time the big dollars are aware of a catalyst and possible positive price action change backed by a strong financial quarter, they price that in for options and then our lottery calls are too expensive and risky to play.

Enough bullshit, lets get down to it.  Before i open my positions, im gonna try and grab some extra money quick trading NIO calls as NIO Day is saturday and should give a small run up friday.

Here are my positions; starting off by selling a short spread, taking the credit, and doubling it down into 2 poor mans calls.  If your primary language is retard i can translate---Me sell shit position and buy 2 good ones!

\-1 $SAM 2/19 1050p, +1 $SAM 2/19 1040p

\-1 $SAM 2/19 1050c,  +1 $SAM 2/19 1040c    x2

Gonna be in it for about a grand, and out for 2 in profits for a total of 3.

5% over the next 5 weeks with a strong catalyst backing it should be an easy task for the big dog to pull off & it will be just in time to make my annual car payment on the 21st ;) wish a fellow retard some luck and drink some tea's for me!",2021-01-08 09:29:38

NIU makes affordable electric scooters. Yet another EV manufacturer I hear you ask.. except this ones cool, it's two wheels, it's sustainable, it's beautiful - the perfect city commuter transport!

Let's get down to the facts and figures:

$2.04 bil mcap

$2.08 bil revenue (2019)

$486 mil profit (2019)

84 PE

$791 mil Net equity


This gives it a price to book ratio of about 2.57 compared to Tesla's 108, you're really getting second to none VALUE!

Revenue EQUAL to its market cap!!! By comparison, Tesla revenue is a mere 5% of its market cap.

In 2015 the UN reported an estimated 5.6billion people live in cities, giving NIU a hugeeeee potential market.

"Stock Market News for Today | RUN, ENPH, TLRY, ACB, NIO, ROKU, CAT, F & Other Stock News [01-07]",0.98,"**Stocks go bonkers while the Dems take Georgia. The Capitol is breached. Is this the time to buy Solar, Pot & Industrial stocks? Let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a mixed day with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/nsJ4qqL) leading the way up over 400points and closing at a new record high, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/kKxbFdQ) also finishing 0.57% up for the day, while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/C7CdfX8) finished the day down 0.6%. All 3 of the big indexes were trading higher earlier in the day before the [VIX](https://ibb.co/4PR24Fc) saw a spike of more than 10% as rioters [STORMED](https://ibb.co/KjbQPkD) the US Capitol, before eventually getting back to certifying the electoral votes, which brought back some stability. This was a very bad incident but shouldn‚Äôt have long-lasting effects on the stock market.

Yesterday we saw almost 70% of [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/Br0Y0hB) advancing with over 300 new highs as the volume also spiked up, as 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/FmhD70s) finished in the green with Banks , Energy and Materials gaining more than 3%, while the biggest loser was by far the tech sectors, dropping 1.7%, as we saw Large-Cap Growth companies underperforming the [MARKET](https://ibb.co/XpbdM7p), while small & mid-caps, especially the value plays, outperformed the market.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/WKhNSZh) from yesterday which shows how Big tech companies suffered yesterday, as the perceived threat of increased [TAXES](https://ibb.co/D79SMMP) spooked the market, while the Industrials, Banks, Green Energy & [POT](https://ibb.co/XZFHGvj) stocks flourished on the hope of a big stimulus with new & improved regulations, as it is expected that there will be an improved legislation that will help the cannabis stocks soar and the possible big stimulus would be a huge boost to most of the [RETAIL](https://ibb.co/GfwgQ3Z) sector which saw names like Nordstrom, GameStop, Target and many others posting big moves to the upside. Joining them should be [COSTCO](https://ibb.co/pQdXm2H), which did lag yesterday, but posted terrific December numbers after hours, with comparable sales increasing more than 10% while e-commerce rose by more than 60% for the month.

Yesterday we also saw the [FED](https://ibb.co/mFgqXN4) deciding to continue the current QE pace, as they still see plenty of uncertainty around, especially in the first quarter of 2021. They will continue to buy $120B worth of securities every month, as well as possibly moving on to some lengthier term maturities, while being opened to even more monetary easing if necessary.

In some more good news, we saw the [Factory Orders](https://ibb.co/jRqfPf7) for November coming it at +1%, better than expected as shipments increased by 0.7%.

While in some other not so good numbers we saw the December [PMI](https://ibb.co/7XjyFjB) slowing to 55.3, less than the 55.7 expected and 58.6 in the previous month, but this is still an indicator of expanding business activity, while ADP [numbers](https://ibb.co/kJ6jjRx) came in worse than expected, as the US lost 123K nonfarm jobs, worse than the 130K addition of jobs expected and 304K jobs gained in the previous month, as we saw a big loss of jobs in large business especially in the leisure/hospitality [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/9sCLVqY). This was the first [month](https://ibb.co/3F8Q9j0) since April when we saw a lose of jobs in the nonfarm private business.

[TODAY](https://ibb.co/vsB6NM2) we have a loaded economic data calendar starting with jobless numbers early in the morning and finishing with the Fed Balance Sheet at the market close.

In some other stock market news, we saw a report that [ROBLOX](https://ibb.co/3yqfGFZ) is looking to go public via direct listing, rather the traditional IPO. The latest funding round at $45/share saw the company valued at almost $30B, which is very high but we have to see the latest books of the company before making a prediction if it will go higher or not. This may be a better opportunity for retail investors to get in at lower prices, rather than buying at 2-3 times the IPO price.

So, guys, due to the latest political developments we have seen a huge shift in the markets, as we saw yesterday the [SOLAR](https://ibb.co/KWH2wHh) stocks having spectacular gains with Sunrun, & SunPower gaining more than 16% with many other companies like [ENPHASE](https://ibb.co/72jTgdq) also soring, while the hydrogen play Plug Power also [soared](https://ibb.co/xDxrq80) more than 20% in after-hours after agreeing to a collaboration with SK Group.

We also saw gambling names move up after with the Senate changing leadership and states like New York pushing for the legalization of [gambling](https://ibb.co/CPFdVpv) in most of the US.

We also saw other companies posting great numbers, with [T-Mobile](https://ibb.co/qC2rXQC) adding 5.5M customers, its best ever number as they lead the industry, while [ROKU](https://ibb.co/qxWCNg4) continued to be one of the best plays in the streaming business alongside Disney & Netflix as they have surpassed 50M accounts.

And on the industrial side we saw companies like Caterpillar and US Steel posting big gains in anticipation of an infrastructure bill that would greatly benefit them.

[Ford](https://ibb.co/yNz7PjD) also beat expectations with a decline in sales of just under 10%, better than the 14% expected as the company continues to move towards more trucks, SUVs & EVs.

On the other-hand we also saw [Chinese](https://ibb.co/rbRQwyq) tech and EV stocks fall, after more bad headlines like the US looking to ban even more big companies in the US like Alibaba & Tencent. This is a continuing story which has peaked up steam in the recent year after the political tensions between the US and China have increased. This companies were also joined by the big tech which continued to face selloff pressure after the blue sweep in Georgia.

My opinion is that you should start buying some green energy, pot and industrial stocks but you shouldn‚Äôt go to heavy on the first day. You should wait for things to cool-off a little and not buy everything at the top. I think a bi-weekly split strategy or monthly strategy would be nice. Which would mean you should divide your investment money and buy especially on red days every couple of weeks or on a monthly basis, but I would avoid Chinese stocks for now at least.

So, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the market as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/LCv8Dp1) markets are mixed while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wghkCJ1) seem to be pointing at a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way,  though in the last few days every single time the futures were up the stocks finished lower and vice-verse, when the futures were red the stocks finished higher, so you shouldn‚Äôt base your investment on this.

Have a great day and see you next time!",2021-01-07 13:03:51
"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news (Jan 6, 2021 after market close)",0.98,"(*Editor's note: It's a [wild day](https://d2qig04bry9arv.cloudfront.net/uploads/2014/04/roller-coaster.jpg) for the market and the country, and I will try to be as neutral as possible despite the fuckery afoot)*.

* Dems clinched the GA Senate run-off election as Warnock defeats Loeffler while Ossoff defeats Perdue (the first millennial Senator). As the results became more clear last night, futures took a deep dive particularly for NQ, while conversely small caps enjoys a favorable bump. The market opened deeply red for QQQ as big tech retreated with renew fear on antitrust probes  and overall an unfriendly corporate environment as Democrats will control WH and both chambers of Congress. 

* By early morning, the sell-off quickly reversed and big tech recovered most of their red, with big tech such as AAPL going from -3% to just shy of yesterday's close during day's high. In contrast to big tech, clean tech and weed soared on Dems securing the Senate. ICLN was up almost 4% during pre-market and as high as 9% during intraday high and HASI was up 10% during intraday high. Weed stock such as TLRY was up as high as 21%, ACB as high as 11%+, and APHA as high as 14%.

* Things quickly pulled back and tech started fading in earnest at 2:15 PM ET when protestors [cosplaying as revolutionaries](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106820104-1609961746992-gettyimages-1230453313-AFP_8YA6MW.jpg) stormed the capitol and Congress had to quickly pause their certifying of the Electoral College votes. Shit got real when a lady got shot as these protestors attempt to storm the [barricaded House chamber](https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1600/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F210106150417-03-house-chamber-0106.jpg) while Reps were still in the building.

* The sell-off accelerated for AAPL, AMZN, FB, MSFT, and NFLX as most drilled back to opening lows by EOD. AAPL closed the day -3.37% to $126.60, AMZN -2.49% to $3,138, FB -2.83% to $263, MSFT -2.59% to $212, and NFLX -3.9% to $500.49. Thanks to overall negative sentiment of all things tech, QQQ closed the day red at -1.39% to $307 (retreating quite a bit more than IXIC given the weigh of big tech in QQQ).

* Morning economic numbers had ADP reporting payrolls dropping to 123k in Dec, slightly below consensus of 130k. PMI was at 54.8 while consensus was 55.3, while factory order was up 1.0% MoM. Thankfully, none of these number fucking matters as the Dow, SPY, and IWM proceed to sky rocket with the market looking forward to stronger spending and stimulus from a Dem controlled govt.

* Beyond weed, clean tech, and infrastructure - financial sector killed it today in particular mid-cap banks such as ZION (up 11.24%), CNC (up 9.81%), and KEY (up 9.73%). You'll find a similar story for large-cap bank stock with JPM closing up 4.70%, BAC up 6.25%, C up 5.75%, and WFC up 7.08%. It's a good thing I've already dumped my reopening [WFC leaps play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kftjzt/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/ggarcbi/) of $25c and $30c which are now fucking ITM by $3~$8 and still have a year left to go on them. Nice.

* In yet another confusing about-face and showing a real Karen spunk, the NYSE is *really* delisting the three Chinese telecoms this time. The real kicker though came in at 2:25 PM ET when news broke that US officials are considering *more* Chinese stock delisting, adding Chinese big tech Alibaba, Tencent, et al. to the potential list. A sea of red soon followed to compound the sell-off as BABA crater to the Earth's core and closed down -5.32%. Following suit, PDD closed down -5.58%, JD down -7.66%, and the same goes for Chinese EV NIO at -5% and XPEV at -2.62%. LI escapes semi-unscathed and closed the day up 2.48% thanks to a new BofA coverage with a Buy rating and a PT of $42.

* In WSB meme stock land, GME was on track for a solid 8-9% day until the storming of the capitol occurred, PLTR's fade accelerated further while MT stays modestly flat, bouncing back from the overall market sell off. GME closed up 5.70% to $18.36, PLTR closed down -4.31% to $23.54, and MT closed up 0.32% to $24.70. ICLN, a new WSB favorite due to new balance of power in Congress might be added to future roundup if it continues to pump. Imagine that, a clean energy boomer ETF becoming a meme stock. The iShares fund managers are probably wondering why their alerts going tits up with social media mentions and sentiment brewing.

* Random trade ideas (these are not financial advice and if it goes wrong that's your own gdamn fault):

    1) FSLY leaps Jan 2022 90c or 100c+ for eventual TikTok climbing back fully onto the service as ByteDance pointedly makes a political jab at outgoing administration. Headwind on this retarded play: cloud/stay-at-home stock continues to take a beating as rona gets under control as vaccine roll out picks up. 

    2) Sell AAPL cash secured puts Jan 15 120p to 122p if the big tech fade continues rest of the week. These ~0.18 to 0.24 delta strikes are likely safe enough and if assigned, you'll have an upcoming ER on Jan 26 to sell IV pumped covered calls to get out of the trade intact. Feb 19 puts are likely okay to sell as well given you'll receive much more premium from the ~43 dte chains. Headwinds on this retarded play: its CSP and CC. As boomer as it gets. 

    3) BABA leaps and/or March debit call spread for another bounce in a wild trading week for BABA. March 230c/250c is probably a sufficient spread while baking in a bit of IV via ER which is on Feb 11. Jan 230c to 250c if you're not poor. Headwind on this retarded play: Jack Ma really is missing and the US govt really will delist a 600 bil market cap Chinese ADR, forcing out all major US institution holders. Yeah, right.

* The DOW closed up 1.44% or 437 pts, Nasdaq down -0.61% or -78 pts, S&P up 0.57% or 21 pts, and RUT closed up 3.98% (!!) or 78 pts. Stay in school kids and avoid storming federal buildings or Twitter will start banning your fucking account. (TWTR locks POTUS account for 12 hrs and is down -1.99% AH).

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GME (Long term Bullish) - If you're not already in GME then I don't recommend playing until you see a break at 18.10 (ish) with heavy volume. If it breaks resistance look out for 18.97-19.74-20.5 range.

If current support fails, look GME to fill a gap at 16.55-15.77 range. If it breaks 15.77 support then we f'ed. Watchout for 14.5-13.50. Anything below 13.5 and that means Cohen probably died or something.

If it breaks 19.74 then we moon to 21-23 range for this week.

TSLA (Bullish): Expecting TSLA to head down to 748 range since it mooned after hours and is near resistance BUT it could hit 757-765-770 because it's TSLA. If green support line fails we could see 740-733-731 area but would need catalyst and volume. If it breaks out of support with no volume then it could trade around no-man's land for the rest of the week while our calles get the theta treatment.

AMD (bullish for earning run): If AMD breaks 93.20 with volume then look out for 95-97.99 range. If it bounce off 93.20 resistance with volume then look out for 91.55-89.55.

Nokia - A truly retarded DD,0.89,"I just want to preface this with saying you guys are fucking retards for going all in on GME and I love it.

Unfortunately, my love and what very little money I can come across does not belong to inflating a company that has robbed people for so long.

This all said, I am here to share with you the only major hunch and play I got left; Nokia. I feel like it is severely undervalued, and for what it's worth, this is a chart-specific play...

\-Moving average and candlestick analysis-

7/16/2012, Nokia bottoms out at $1.63.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q7xnyyeswm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c7bcbb0221d8c69d85d364c77a930b7af0bd9d3

9/15/2014, a bullish correction/impulse tops out at $8.73.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1brpg9xswm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=d97f7ac1c12b6a6d0f89b3b64c7088ccdb42b7a7

&#x200B;

10/14/2013, Nokia broke above the red 200 MA, and on 8/24/2015 had a successful retest of it for support.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/88ray7itwm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=06b1887ef8318559b24735b34cdcff8b458b1478

Between 02/08/2016 and 04/18/2016, Nokia fought to stay above the red 200w MA.

On the week of 04/18/2016, Nokia produced a bearish doji candle at the red 200w MA and finally succumbed to large sell volume from gay bears confirming it as resistance.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vawm55ouwm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=f887e9f69e05c193357ff0e0585a60dee3fc1cc5

Since that candle, the price of Nokia has fluctuated in a large, 2,009 day range between a high of $6.65 and a low of $2.34.

The 200w MA has been tested and rejected 6 times, with the most recent occurrence being on the trading week of 08/03/2020.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uar1813vwm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=f31c2d379750c5116c196615bcb95bedd0b44c0e

\-Fibonnaci analysis-

Nokia has stair-stepped down from one Fib to the next ever since confirming the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement as resistance on the week of 01/25/2016.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o6dbdwivwm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=91bc2178b0c8d05b56705413ae1901dc2b01517c

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e7k92wzvwm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6b40681cefa6b65290d02ec3d68c70741fc4e0b

&#x200B;

Nokia then struggled from 02/01/2016 to 07/22/2019 for 1,267 days with breaking and staying above the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement. The 0.382 retracement during this time frame was also roughly the same area the red 200w MA resided, which provided confluence for the gay bears.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j9xzweewwm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=45f488b30cf0f9d122c775298800ea52b84e3cda

11/14/2016, Nokia very briefly broke below the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement and was very rapidly brought back up to test the red 200w MA. This major test of resistance was, yet again, a failure. From this moment forward Nokia was only able to genuinely break above the red 200w MA one time, 01/07/2019. After ranging above it for only a few short months, Nokia broke below and a subsequent retest caused a massive 42.29% drop in less than 4 months.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/etvy6bvwwm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e6f46a8038b393789966aa751c2d4bfa39145da

For approximately 3 months afterwards, Nokia attempted to regain upward traction. It was rejected immediately as soon as it hit the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, causing yet another major 48.34% selloff from Covid fears. This selloff yielded a low of $2.34, the lowest share price it has had in approximately 2,750 days. On the week of 07/27/2020, Nokia was able to again very briefly break above the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. After producing a low volume bull flag below the 200w MA, it was rejected to a low of $3.21. Since the Covid price of  $2.34, $3.21 has so far been the next higher low for Nokia and has since produced another fairly low volume bull flag.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z1lrfnj1xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=1854900a6c47ecb596d43eaf8643da4d8cc595cd

&#x200B;

For the retards like myself who can't maff very well, 2,750 days comes out to 7.53 years. During Covid, Nokia hit a fucking low that it has not seen in over SEVEN POINT FIVE YEARS. SEVEN POINT FIVE YEARS.

&#x200B;

\-RSI analysis-

This is where shit gets fucking \*interesting\*.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vwh8jmx1xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=a60db103050a04f08ff4ed4bb5773714a3e8f931

This is the weekly timeframe.

Notice the trendline. On 9 different occasions, Nokia has attempted to break above it only to be rejected and fail support tests.

On the 10th occasion, Nokia was able to have a minor breakout, successfully retest the trendline, and have a significant rise thereafter.

The 10th occasion has so far been the longest Nokia has been able to stay above this trendline, with 2 major successful tests of support.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1d2l1wc2xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=583631d853cc314794e4524fbe1979b9905d5d33

It is now battling with the bullish 50 RSI area for the 3rd time. Each of two prior tests of 50 RSI also coincided with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. That means this is a major zone.

After breaking back below the 0.618, the RSI trendline was successfully tested for support. It then bearfagged back up to the 0.618, only to nosedive on a high volume dump.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hx7jsnp2xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=54cefc4accb3d4ba9cdb8aab9cfdb686b27c234a

This is the 2 week RSI.

Notice how on 3 separate occasions, 60 RSI has so far been rejected. The first two occasions were roughly the same price point, while the third occasion was with a significantly lower high.

This shows hidden bearish divergence, which was likely a major reason for the price to have dumped so hard from its local high. One thing I have learned about hidden bearish divergence is that it is often an early indicator of buyer strength. It pretty much always results in a retracement, but thereafter, a fairly large rise. This occasion is so far clearly no different.

Notice also that there is significant bullish divergence in the RSI.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d5utlt63xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=500b6016b6dd1b8524e851ebd150168dac68bf67

&#x200B;

This is the 2 month RSI.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w8ck0em3xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=77b1582663e94cf7e91bb22587f1751a0f3855f0

50 RSI is getting hardcore rejected every time price causes the RSI to go anywhere near it. This is a strong indicator in my experience of accumulation.

The moment 50 RSI breaks on the 2 month RSI and there will likely be a very, very parabolic amount of buying support.

&#x200B;

My second favorite of this TA: the 3 month RSI.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i2z7gn04xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=71b056135b91044375d9f96ea8b502a230d4ec0a

40 RSI absolutely refuses to break, but hey, it has on a few different occasions. Notice the reactions in price however whenever 40 RSI breaks.

Price moons.

After a bullish engulfing candle starting 04/01/2020, 2 subsequent 3 month candles have so far been rejected at entering below 40 RSI, one of which having a very long tail and closing as a long legged doji. This is another strong indicator of reversal aka buying support. They also coincide with the 0.786 and near perfect closes below the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement.

Someone is accumulating.

&#x200B;

\-Patterns-

And now, my favorite part of this TA.

Have you been wondering what the big ass white line is for in some of my screenshots, or do you already know? They say when something is too good to be true, it almost always is. I won't ever give up hope that it isn't, however.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tm5z6lf4xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4451933afe22fdd8e8874ea3350f9c3c92dac3b

&#x200B;

There are 2 white lines in this screenshot. Both are what I believe \*could be\* inverted head and shoulders patterns. If either one of them completes, they can very very easily jump start the next rise in this asset.

If the small one completes, the target for it will be the 7th time contending with the 200w MA residing currently at $5.07.

If both of them complete, Nokia has a minimum price target of roughly $9. IF however the $9 target is met, it will have over doubled the current price for this stock. That \*will\* cause FOMO.

I will admit, I've had not the greatest luck in spotting real inverted head and shoulders patterns. They let me down alot. :()

&#x200B;

Long story short, 1/20/22 leaps are currently at $13/$14 a piece right now on Robinhood.

If you pay $14 for a 12 month leap contract, you're essentially 'betting' $1.1666 per month that Nokia will make you money.

I find it incredibly difficult to believe you won't make at least SOME money on this play.

Especially considering months ago, this particular contract bottomed out at $0.12. It just did it again. Double bottom?

&#x200B;

I apologize ahead of time if anything seems off, I have checked and double checked this TA to make sure screenshots are accurate, etc..but I'm far from perfect. I guarantee you I fucked something up.

anyway, buy Nokia while you're waiting on GME or PLTR or NIO or whatever. Think deep in your thoughts what constitutes a *real* meme stock and **NOKIA?** ...

# Intro/Disclaimer

yeah its long as fuck, but read for tendies. If its too long suck a bear dick and move on. This is real analysis of the business model, not just a bunch of emojis. It is so long because of the niche field it is operating in and how a lot of key points are not understood well by the WSB community. This company really is a diamond in the rough and a great way to play future trends with less risk as you're not picking winners. Its the ""picks and shovels"" play of electrification and renewable energies. I'll explain the realistic case for how this company is soon going to be running the best tendie mine for decades to come.

This is my second DD post on now $MP, formerly $FVAC, and i'm back to discuss the developments of the company since my pre-merger post and add some further analysis about the valuation of the company and its future. **There has been too much really shitty DD** from both bulls and bears **on this company**where very few people on here have a real understanding of this company, their business model, and the future.

First - read my original DD post in order to have a decent understanding of the backstory cause I'm not about to type out all that shit again or explain what I've already written. Read that first then come back:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jgvarn/fvac\_dd\_evchina\_tension\_play/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jgvarn/fvac_dd_evchina_tension_play/)

That post discusses mainly international tensions and the role REE's but this one i'll speak more on the business case of this company and how even without geopolitical tensions it is a true tendie mine.

Second - no I'm not a bag holder Ive been in since it was a pre-merged SPAC my average on my shares is about $14 and my LEAP is far far ITM and no I'm not selling any of them. Also, as i referenced in the post I work in a very similar field and interned in college at a mineral mine in the refining aspect as a chemical engineer, so while I'm not an expert at this I have more insight than the average retard and I am trying to give out tendies before the boomers take them from us. I will try my best to explain the business model of a mining company and why this company is the most unique and interesting way to get tech company level growth with the associated free cash flow while not having to be anywhere near as innovative. Ill discuss a lot of the bear arguments for this company as well and try to de-bunk them as most don't really hold water once you look into them the slightest bit.

# Background of NdPr

While the company produces as basket of Rare Earth, the plant is aiming to focus on NdPr and other permanent magnet materials in order to play the trend of EV's and electrification. These magnets are extremely important for so many technologies due to how Electric motors work. To put it simply, at current technology the only way to convert electricity to motion or the only way to convert motion to electricity relies on permanent magnets. Im not gonna try to explain more than that because I too am retarded but if you don't believe me or want to learn how watch this  [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWulQ1ZSE3c):

yeah i know you didn't watch that video, but just imagine you did and now believe me.

However, because it works both ways BOTH electric motors AND electric generators rely on this technology. This is key for understanding how NdPr is the best way to play both the trends of electrification AND renewables. First, electrification is most embodied by the rise in EV's in the future, and while that is predicted to be the fastest growing segment of NdPr demand it is foolish to not to account for other evolving technologies reliant on electric motors as well. Robotics will be a huge growth market and electrification of other industries will rely on NdPr permanent magnets. The other massive growth opportunity for permanent magnets is through renewable energies. Wind energy (and possible future motion based energy harvesting tech like tidal energy) work through harvesting mechanical motion and turning a generator to create electricity. Wind power doesn't work without electric generators which don't work without magnets. In addition, wind tech is advancing down a path to require even more magnets due to improvements is Permanent Magnet Direct-Drive (PMDD) technology from the current Gearbox doubly-fed induction Generator (DFIG). Essentially what that means is the new technology will take out the gearbox currently used in wind mills and replacing them with more efficient direct driving technology allowing more mechanical motion into electricity. These new generators require stronger magnets, thus more magnetic material. Read more about that [here](https://www.goldwindamericas.com/pmdd):

**TLDR**: They mine mainly permanent magnet materials that at current scientific understanding CANNOT be replaced due to their unique electromagnetic properties.

**TLDR on the TLDR**: Special Rocks no replacing. Need special rocks.

# $MP's expansion plans

A lot of bears like to bring up the fact that $MP is still reliant on China to do their refining and they're correct... for now. Currently they mine on site and refine to REE concentrates which they then send to china to refine into Rare Earth Oxides (REO's), which then get send to become metal alloys and then finally to magnets. Currently is the only location in the world to refine past concentrate material so $MP is forced to send their material there, but that is why the went public. The intent of them going public was to raise funds in order build an on-site REO facitility, which is scheduled for completion in 2022 and is already started. They already have enough cash on hand to furnish this upgrade as they had over $500M on hand at the end of Q3, and they also are a cash flow positive company already before even moving downstream. There are EV infrastructure plays with much worse valuations and years away from breaking even on cash flow, yes I'm talking to you $QS bagholders... that tech is unproven and there are so many battery competitors in a field where there WILL be a winner

Why would they want to move downstream when they're already profitable??? Because the further downstream they go the higher margins they earn and the more tendies they can mine for us. Refining raw materials to useful materials is a value adding process and thus creates more value for the company that does it. Once they complete this expansion they plan on going to stage 3 of their business model, the ability to build magnets and other final products of REE's in America. They have not decided/disclosed their plans for this, whether it is through construction of an onsite facility, an acquisition, or a joint venture, but it is in the plans. This is expected to come online around 2025 and when the insane cash flow can begin for the company. I don't have any reason to doubt the validity of their intention as its just a continuation of the business model they are currently implementing and the majority of the corporate rhetoric is related to ""mine-to-magnet"" and ""restoring the REE supply chain to America.""

What does this mean for the company? as they move further and further downstream they will increase their margins from this action alone, but it gets even better. This can be shown in their in-house calculations of their 2023 adj. EBITDA target of $252M

&amp;amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/s25.q4cdn.com\/570172628\/files\/doc\_financials\/2020\/q3\/MP-3Q20-Earnings-Deck-FINAL-11.23.2020.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/7eiobfp84f961.png?width=1258&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a41e24edbdadb0b1e55ec53ae92f7c4109f19b8d)

it is important to note that those numbers are from the current step they are taking right now in building the REO refining facility. Adding further downstream capabilities will only cause that EBITDA value to grow as margins improve, but next I'll discuss where their margins will improve from EVEN MORE.

**TLDR**: downstream expansion is a way to increase margins and therefore free cash flow for the company.

**TLDR of TLDR**: Special rock get more special. Get more tendies for special rock.

# Business model of mining companies and why $MP has insane growth potential

*\*\*\*This is the most important part of this long ass post, if you read one section, then read this\*\**

A big disconnect on a lot of DD in this sub and analysis elsewhere is the economics of how a mining company works. A mine is by definition a COMMODITY PLAY, which I know is not as exciting as a tech company, BUT it will experience tech sector growth for a period of time and then experience a period of time in which develop into a cash cow business reaping huge dividends for shareholders.

What i mean by a commodity play is through the economics of how a mine operates. Given a mine at a fixed production volume, the costs on a year in year out basis are relatively similar. What i mean by this is the cost $MP to mine and refine into concentrate will be the same no matter the price of their product. However, the revenue they receive is dependent on the market price of their product, which is what varies the most. An easy way to describe this is through taking a look at their Q3 2020 financial results presentation:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/s25.q4cdn.com\/570172628\/files\/doc\_financials\/2020\/q3\/MP-3Q20-Earnings-Deck-FINAL-11.23.2020.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/ijzcpgmc4f961.png?width=760&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d8bbfb1ba67f429886dc4abb6b6f1a9ef5862db1)

That value of Production cost (at the current stage of just creating REE concentrates) will realistically stay the same as that value is from the cost of labor, energy for machinery, administrative costs, etc. While these numbers will vary from quarter to quarter these are costs not predicted to experience rapid growth and this is what is important to realize. It costs roughly the same amount of money to pay someone to blast ore, dig it into dump trucks, pay operators to refine into ore, etc. Don't trust me, look into how steel companies operate, like this sub's favorite $MT. The revenue they receive is dependent on the price of REE's, which is NOT PREDICTED TO BE FLAT. Here is the historic graph of Neodymium from 2011-current:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/tradingeconomics.com\/commodity\/neodymium](https://preview.redd.it/q1ytv5ch4f961.png?width=1502&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6b5ddfa993ccb75cdf3638d13cbdf2748ccb7c9c)

\*\*If you are an investor in $MP (which you should be) this is an important website to pay attention to because understanding the market dynamics of their product is important to understanding the valuation of this company. \*\*

Allow me to disect that graph a little bit:

1st Peak: From the aftermath of the supply shock from 2010/2011 from the Japanese Navy and Chinese fisherman story i discusses in my previous $FVAC post i linked above. China lowered exports by 40% and the price shot up drastically as industries across the world tried to gobble up as much NdPr as fast as possible in order to ensure their production lines. That was then followed by china flooding the market and selling back that backlog. that caused prices to fall off a cliff and ended up taking molyorp out of business. I'll discuss the Molycorp saga later more in depth and the differences of them and $MP.

2nd Peak: This peak (late 2017) is from the Trade war trump caused with china and is another good explanation of the correlation between REE's and geopolitics i discussed in my last DD post. The middle 2019 peak is again the trade war heating up again.

3rd peak: where we are now. This is from the increased tailwind of EV adoption, more from asia and Europe than the US **and** because china has been threatening to use REE's as a political tool again, which again i referenced more in my last DD post.

However going forward if you want to predict the amount of revenue MP will earn its important to understand the market dynamic and I'd like to discuss why the price is geopolitics aside predicted to steadily increase at a very fast rate. MP, like any other commodity play, relies on the supply-demand dynamic of the sector, and REE demand growth is on track to far outstrip the supply growth. This will result increased prices per ton, but MP's costs stay the same. This is the beauty of the company, as the price goes up their margins go up too! MP and market analysts predicted over a 100% growth in NdPr magnets in the next 10 years:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/s25.q4cdn.com\/570172628\/files\/doc\_financials\/2020\/q3\/MP-3Q20-Earnings-Deck-FINAL-11.23.2020.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/v0ta2r1l4f961.png?width=872&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6281317204c497d54b7024e5208e7f04b8254db7)

Don't believe that metric? check this more in depth one:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.arultd.com\/products\/supply-and-demand.html](https://preview.redd.it/7kjnncgn4f961.jpg?width=6279&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=97e90f92aa1b996a80b0dacc02fb2ecc09086815)

This graph shows most important metric as it shows that the world at current rate is not scaling up to meet demand. THIS GRAPH INCLUDES CURRENT PLANNED EXPANSIONS INCLUDING INCREASED RECYCLING. What does this mean?? There is a huge mismatch in projected demand and supply and if you don't know what that will mean then ask your wife's boyfriend about supply-demand graphs from their economics class. The result will be massively increased prices of permanent magnet materials because the world will not be able to mine and refine enough to satisfy demand, so they will be able to increase their prices. BUT AS I SAID EARLIER, MP'S COSTS PER TON WILL REMAIN THE SAME. So what is the gist of this coupled with MP moving toward downstream expansion? MP's margins will increase incredibly from a double whammy of moving downstream AND supply-demand imbalance. Now what does that mean for you?? that means $MP has a very realistic and conservative path toward becoming a company with RIDICULOUS free cash flow.

What does that mean for MP? That means that the company will be raking in cash and will be extremely flexible due to their balance sheet. They will be able to expand operations or acquire competitors in order to increase their market share and production volumes OR they will be able to transition into a boomer dividend company that will pay you tendies each year. They could do either of those very easily because the company HAS NO DEBT. In fact, $MP ended Q3 2020 with $507M CASH on hand to finance their future expansions. Okay, i know dividends are boring but the market will begin to price in that future dividend potential and give your calls many tendies along the path to pricing in their dividend power.

**TLDR**: Supply demand imbalance (with geopolitical tensions as a wild card) will result in insane free cash flow in the future for this company.

**TLDR of the TLDR**: People want more special rock more than can make special rock. People give you more tendies for special rocks.

# Why Supply won't be able to scale up as fast

A very important assumption in my analysis is the inability for supply to scale up as fast as demand and I'd like to explain this more in depth as it is the crux of this DD. This is where my experience in mineral refining is valuable as I can weigh in on this aspect. Over time there will be more suppliers that come into the business and we are seeing that already, however this is where the timetables of that come into play. Simply put supply can't go up because companies will be slowed greatly due to the time it will take to get up and running and the incredible amount of upfront capital needed before even starting up the mine. If a company is interested in getting into the field there isn't a fast path in because the companies can't just decide to go into the business and then go to the ""REE refining machinery store"" and buy the equipment and have them get set up. All the machinery in chemical manufacturing plants (REE refining counts as chemical engineering so hear me out) has a long path in order to reach the optimum design. Ill outline the gist of this here:

1. Lab Scale Testing: This is laboratory scale testing in which very small batches are prepared testing different procedures and methods in order to find the optimum refining process for the goals of the operation. This is when the deciding of the catalysts, solvents, additive chemicals, etc is done in order to decide **what to do** to the ore to get the best product.
2. Pilot Plant Design and Testing: This step in the design process is designing and building a small scale model of machinery to run the process decided upon in lab scale testing in order to determine different operating conditions, determine control points, etc. This is when different tests and procedures are determined and also a proof of concept to begin economic calculations for designing the next step.
3. Full scale design and building: This is when the full size, real-deal machinery is designed and constructed. But again, there is not ""REE refining manufacturing store"" to get much of this machinery. Refining plants are custom designed (minus certain machinery like pumps and basic ass shit like that) and custom built. These are custom designed, custom fabricated large scale machinery designed in every aspect from material, area, volume, and depth in order to lower manufacturing costs while also allowing for 24/7 continuous operation. The 24/7 operation aspect is important because it is why the machinery is designed so meticulously. The most economic operations are ones that require little down time and little maintenance and a lot of work is put in to optimize this aspect. That means it takes even more time to produce.
4. Permitting and Certification: Now at this point the company is years into the development of REE refining, but they still can't start operating despite the entire operation up and running. In the US, now the lovely and very fast government gets to come in. Mining and refining operations don't operate under OSHA rules and procedures, they get to operate under OSHA's much meaner, expensive, and safety prone brother, the Mining Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). Government inspectors have to come in and permit and certify EVERY PIECE OF MACHINERY, inspect every single moving part and permit them, and do a shit ton of other stuff for the government to allow you to begin operations. Now due to the stimulus bill's provisions toward stimulating REE capabilities in the United states I assume that MSHA will be (or already has been) told to prioritize REE companies and they will probably be fast tracked, but even fast tracking them will take a lot of time. In addition EPA has to come in and sign off on the environmental plans of the company and probably even more government entities will have to come in to sign off on stuff that was past my exposure when I interned in the field.

Now you've seen how long it would take to get up and running, but another constraint worth mentioning is who does these? Larger Chemical or mining companies (Dow, DuPont, Chemours, BASF, etc) looking to enter the field probably have their own design teams that would be able to do it in house. Smaller, non-conglomerate entities would have to hire a chemical engineering design/consulting firm to come in and do the designing, write the procedures, and train the production engineers and operators. That means there is some decent intellectual constraints as to how many people have the know-how to design at the rate needed to scale up.

**Here is what is important,** any entity trying to enter the sector will have enormous upfront costs in buying the land, designing the plant, buying the machinery like excavators, dump trucks, pipelines, pay employees well before starting due to training on the machinery. Im not sure the exact amounts of money needed but it would easily be in the 100s of millions at least. Then once all that upfront capital is sourced, plant designed, people trained, etc the operation would take YEARS to get out of all that debt and achieve meaningful positive cash flow. It is only a matter of time for $MP to have significant domestic competition, but by the time these operations could begin operating $MP will be so far ahead in production and have a significantly stronger balance sheet than these companies could have. **$MP will remain years ahead of any other domestic competitors**, even though competition will come.

**TLDR**: At current outlook supply growth won't match demand growth and even if more competitors pop up to compete it'll take years to start operating and even more years to match $MP's ability.

**TLDR on the TLDR**: Not enough people finding special rock. More people want special rock than can get special rock. They pay more for special rock.

# $MP's competitors, both domestic and international

A large argument that bears like to make is that competition is coming in the US, and they are 100% correct.... but it won't matter because AGAIN this is a commodity play, not a tech company. They make magnets, their revenue will depend on the price of their product. Buyers from this are not looking at $MP like you would look at $TSLA vs. $NIO or apple vs android where you could argue one is better than the other or consumers will adopt one over the other. There isn't brand recognition, increased utility, or consumer favorites in magnets, they're fucking magnets. Think about it like another commodity, lumber. If you go to $HD to buy some wood you aren't staring at two different planks of the same type of tree and picking one because of which timber company felled it or which milling company milled it. You just buy lumber and go home because it is wood. A timber company isn't outright threatened by another timber company popping up, as long as the demand-supply dynamic in the market stays the same the first timber company is unaffected. That is why it won't matter WHEN more domestic and international competitors pop up. As long as demand outstrips supply then commodity companies will make more and more money. Now I am not trying to bullshit people so I'll discuss the international and domestic competition, but Ill explain more in depth why i don't give a shit about them.

Domestic: The ticker that cannot be named due to it being banned. If you take a look at that company it is a Uranium producer that is going to re-purpose machinery onsite from uranium production to REE production and they have successfully done pilot plant level processing. However if you analyze their production numbers you'll see that the scale they plan on producing is not quite at the level $MP will. They plan on refining 15,000 tons of ore per year with an estimated 55% REE concentration, which leaves an estimated 8,250 tons of REE per year, of which 22% is NdP (all their numbers not mine), which leaves annual production of 1,815 tons/yr. These numbers are pretty good and I do own a stake in this company because I like the potential, but its scale is not quite the scale of $MP. $MP is predicting a run rate of 6,075 tons/yr of NdPr, so yes the banned ticker is a decent competitor but its only predicting to be 1/3 the size of $MP annual production volume. A downside of the banned ticker is that they still are focusing on Uranium production so its not a pure REE play, but Uranium has a pretty decent bull case for the future so i don't want to slander that ticker too much. However, again, these are commodity plays, $MP having competition, even domestic, doest really affect their business plans or bull case. Additionally, the banned ticker is sourcing its ore rom Chemours' location in GA, but getting milled in Utah, so this is a long term inefficiency to consider as well that $MP won't have to worry about once their stage 2 REO mill is complete. the banned tickers financial health is pretty decent, but its market cap is $516M at close 1/4 which is just slightly above amount of cash on hand $MP had at the end of Q3 2020, $502M. That company is more of an investment opportunity than a competitor, if its even worth investing in.

Other emerging domestic competitors: [link to article explaining them all](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-rareearths-projects-factbox/factbox-rare-earths-projects-under-development-in-u-s-idUSKCN2241L6) Im not going to go deep into each one but you can see that many are slowed down to the process I explained above about how expensive and time consuming it is to reach operational status. These companies will be coming online, but won't be profitable for a while and won't be able to provide the same returns to investors for even longer.

International competitors: Lynas Corp. This is an Australian mining company that has also received pentagon funds to improve the non-China production capacity. They trade over the counter and are a real deal competitor and also worth investing in but their growth potential isn't as clear or easy as in the US. They have pentagon funding more so out of desperation by the pentagon to get more production in the western world than loving to invest in an Australian company. In the future I would imagine a lot of this government support will go toward US based companies.

International competitors: all the china ones. yes they produce the largest amount of material in the world and do it the cheapest but this is the result of none to very little environmental protection. Once the supply chain can go ""mine to magnet"" many companies will look to diminish their exposure to chinese companies to ensure their supply chains are not at the whims of the Chinese government. In addition, $MP is the cleanest REE mine in the world and a lot of environmentally conscious companies will want to support clean mined REE's and once domestic production is high enough there could be regulations passed to further incentivize purchasing domestically produced REE's.

**All these companies were included in the forecast of supply in 2030. Even with these companies coming online $MP is still positioned for incredible returns.**

**TLDR**: Yes competition is coming, but there is already competition. Its also a commodity play so its not facing replacement or redundancy like many other growth markets

**TLDR on the TLDR**: Others find special rock. Your special rock still worth many tendies. You still get many tendies.

# Why this is NOT molycorp 2.0

The most common point of argument against this company is that people bring up the fact that the mine $MP operates used to be run by Molycorp, which went bankrupt. However if you read into that transaction it really isn't that scary. Molycorp did go under but this was in a period of price instability and they were not running as good of an operation. Molycorp operated during the 2010-2011 peak of REE's when china restricted supply. Molycorp stock went up a ton in addition to their revenue and thus they decided to invest in milling capabilities to create REO's (I know this is $MP's plan but don't get scared yet). Because of US EPA restrictions it was wildly expensive and at bankruptcy they had $1.7B in investments into capital projects to improve their refining capability, but the subsequent REE price collapse when china ""turned the taps back on"" to the world supply caused them to not afford operation. The site then changed hands back and forth until it was [bought by $MP's current management for $40M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molycorp). They then invested in it after literally buying for less than pennies on the dollar and got it up and running more efficiently than before. Last quarter Q3 2020 they ran 3.2x the REE concentrate production volume than Molycorp ever did:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/s25.q4cdn.com\/570172628\/files\/doc\_financials\/2020\/q3\/MP-3Q20-Earnings-Deck-FINAL-11.23.2020.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/c53c5a8w4f961.png?width=704&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5a5d9f65cad202807588fe516b399ca954cef08a)

They got to buy over $1.7B worth of investments for $40M and have proven they have turned those investments into operating profit. In addition, previous operations prioritized Cerium production for FCC catalysts. $MP has transitioned the goal product to be NdPr as it has much better growth potential to give it long term possibility. In addition, the market climate Molycorp operated under was not as forgiving as now. Back then there wasn't the tailwind of increasing EV adoption, or the rise of other high tech growth sector reliant on REE's. Molycorp was too early and inefficient to win in the market and didn't have anywhere close to the amount of governmental support for the industry. There is bipartisan support on all levels, i mentioned this a bit in my last DD post, but since then - and this is big and shows the scale of gov support- [THE LAST STIMULUS BILL HAD $800M IN SUPPORT OF INCREASING DOMESTIC REE PRODUCTION](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/miners-laud-800m-rare-earth-fund-in-omnibus-bill-61939620)! Molycorp didn't have anywhere close to this level of government support. And again, the pentagon invested $9M into $MP to help fund their REO mill because the pentagon views the ability to refine REO's as a matter of national security.

# Discussing Concerns about Biden Presidency

People who say this shit clearly have no idea what they are talking about. Biden (or his puppet masters but who cares money is all green) has said he supports REE mining multiple times [source](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-mining/exclusive-biden-campaign-tells-miners-it-supports-domestic-production-of-ev-metals-idUSKBN27808B). His team knows their big environmental initiatives rely on REE production and that domestic production is important to keep American industry at the whims of China. Yeah Trump was more hawkish with china but lets not act like a democratic presidency is going to let china walk all over the US or that Biden and other democrats will stop their push for EV's and clean energy. REE's are a cornerstone piece to so many of Biden's plans there is no way he turns his back on this company.

# Discussion of Shenghe Resources and China and their relationships with $MP

The one real concern that people have is their partnership with Shenghe Resources where Shenghe has agreed to buy all $MP concentrate through 2021 and shenghe is a stakeholder in $MP. Many view this as a negative, but i think it should be seen as a good way to ensure survival in the gap between now and the final magnet production. A big issue would be if China chose to stop importing the MP concentrate, which would give MP no customers. Since this would adversely affect Shenge it makes it less likely and also the fact that MP produces 15% of the world's REE concentrate it would hurt the supply in china, which is huge. In fact, China removed their 25% tariff on importing REE material, read this [source](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2104418-china-to-remove-import-tariff-on-us-rare-earth-ores) as it also shows how china is buying up all the concentrate they can. Japan has the capability to go from REO to NdPr magnet as well so if china ends up fucking MP, starting in 2022 when their REO site is in operation then they will be able to sell their REO to Japanese companies to bridge the gap before they have their own magnet making capability.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/s25.q4cdn.com\/570172628\/files\/doc\_financials\/2020\/q3\/MP-3Q20-Earnings-Deck-FINAL-11.23.2020.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/fnvxv8415f961.png?width=2494&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=67a5db04a13d3e1c32d0f20de57b0f291e5b841a)

China is not likely to fuck MP and stop buying their concentrate as it will hurt china's wallet and ability to produce goods while only increasing the US government support for going mine to magnet domestically. China realistically views their dominance as ending at some point now, but they know they will still be able to control the market because of their scale regardless of whether they buy MP concentrates or not.

Also, if Shenghe doesn't buy their concentrates then they forfeit their stake in MP. they wouldn't be allowed to sell them on the market, the shares would just disappear, so it would effectively be a massive stock buyback and as long as the REO mill is complete then they just sell to Japanese magnet makers.

# Mine Life discussion

Their S-1 states that at current proven reserves they have about 47 years of mine life left. That can be grown from drilling and exploration of more mineable material, which they stated they plan on doing. in addition, if they for some reason don't find more mineable ore on their land and don't buy more land with ore, then they could simply refine ore from other mines as the real cost barrier isn't the digging out of the ground, it is the milling.

# TLDR

$MP will to the moon over the next few years.

Postions: shares for virgins and LEAPs for chads.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Edit: addressing $QS collapse today (1/4 after a -40% on $QS) and the associated EV infrastructure. I think $QS hitting the shitter, well, predictable. People flooded to it as a result of attempting to find a parallel way to play the rise of EV's without understanding the company. $QS is a solid state battery technology, but I have never held a stake in it because, well, all it is is an idea or concept. It fell today as a result of a report criticizing the basis of its technology and I have to agree, the tech is not proven and even if it works as advertised there is a question of whether it could ever solidify its valuation, even after its collapse today. Solid state batteries MAY be the future, but for now their real place is in university and R&amp;amp;D laboratories as the tech is not proven to work as advertised. They are in the same situation as liquid metal batteries, cool ideas without the proof they will be successful in the market. HOWEVER, $MP is a way to play EV's &amp;amp; Renewable energy without the risk because $MP is not relying on scientific breakthroughs, it is a commodity producer. They don't care who wins the EV race, the battery tech or company that wins the battery race, or the wind energy companies that win contracts, all they care about is the mass adoption fo those technologies. It is a unique way to play these trends without having to bet on winners or losers in the field as you're betting solely on the industry. The company is positioned to benefit greatly regardless of who wins and lets be real, the market is incredibly saturated with companies that won't win. Look at all the different EV makers big and small, the different battery companies, etc. I have a tough believing that all the small EV makers will have a shot when the large auto companies get more involved. I believe the best way to see profit without that risk is through symmetrical bets with no breakthroughs needed, just the market to develop

EDIT 2: Further DD/ another take. Yeah maybe 1 person will actually read it but it‚Äôs a lot shorter than mine, really won‚Äôt take long to read the thread. It is not my DD but rather an obscure Twitter account I have no connection to but they bring up further interesting bull arguments and address current valuation better than I can. I have no finance background so I didn‚Äôt try to pin a price or movement. https://twitter.com/dawn_capital/status/1346134740659818496?s=21

Edit 3: Research report from brand essence research estimates that REE market size is expected to reach $20.6 Billion by 2025, significantly higher the the 11 billion size from 2019 with a CAGR of 8.2%. MP currently produces 15% of the ore in the world and in 2022 is expected to be milling REO. Let‚Äôs say global production does increase and $MP doesn‚Äôt expand out and falls to 10% of global supply. That‚Äôs still about $2 Billion in revenue with higher margins than they operate on right now because of REO production.... it‚Äôs a tendie mineüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Disclaimer: this is my thoughts on the company and market, yet I am on this site and also retarded. I am long via shares and call and am a true believer in them but best in mind my confirmation bias. Not investment advice, do your own DD, buying and selling $MP is your own decision",2021-01-05 01:46:12

After NIO day:,1.0,,2021-01-04 22:46:00
Great Leap Ideas for 2021 - BTFD,0.9,"Stocks broadly dipped today (Jan 4), and tomorrow, the positions will likely dip further because of uncertainty over the GA runoff elections. But fear not and BTFD. Here're some top picks:  


1. NIO. Just released its December 2020 delivery numbers yesterday, and as expected, they killed it. 121% increase in deliveries for 2020. Deliveries doubled year-over-year. There are also rumors that Nio will open its first non-Chinese store in Copenhagen, Denmark. It's comfortably over $50 today. I predict $60+ by Nio Day. Furthermore, I predict over $100 by eoy. Anything below $45 looks good rn. Weeklies might be worth it, but to be safe, go for leaps.   

2. JMIA. This is the African Alibaba-Amazon. I'm being a touch anecdotal, but I bought BABA when it was $60/share, and while waiting for its meteoric rise, BABA received the same criticism 12 years ago that JMIA is getting now (\[China's\] infrastructure is weak! They're not tech-savvy! They're not revenue positive!), I also see parallel upsides: JMIA knows its customers. It services over 12 countries and has a customer base of 1.2-Billion people. That's more customers than what Alibaba has in China. Furthermore, JMIA's platform has a payment system like Alipay, a food delivery service like DoorDash, and a travel booking service like Expedia all bundled in one platform that happens to also be one of the most popular websites/mobile apps in Africa.   
JMIA will monopolize many industries in the large and rapidly growing continent of Africa. MasterCard and Goldman Sachs are some of their investors. The two co-ceo's (Europeans) formerly worked at McKinsey, and their African co-founder is a Harvard MBA alum and successful entrepreneur. Fun fact: Alibaba outcompeted Ebay in China and became the de facto local E-commerce provider. Similarly, JMIA out-competed Amazon and Alibaba to be the most popular platform in Africa.    

3. PLTR. The stock price will suck for a couple of months, but hear me out. Compared to its share price, the covered call premiums are juicy. I have 1000 shares and make around 300 - 700 a week from holding them. I don't mind holding for the long term because of the enormous upside. Most of PLTR's current clients are government groups like the US Military, the FBI, and the Greek Government, but they plan to increasingly expand their services to private companies under the ""Foundry"" Platform, which is projected to have a market size of $56B. According to the PLTR website, Foundry will serve ""approximately 6,000 companies with more than $500-million in annual revenue"". It's no wonder CEO Alex Karp said investors will be ""pleasantly surprised."" It might dip below 20 near-term, but hold for the long-term tendies. 

Again, the above three stocks will likely suffer from the GA Senate runoff election's volatility, but these are opportunities to load up on more shares and/or buy leaps. We're still in a Fed-fueled secular bull market. A republican senate would be favorable for stocks, but I think NIO and PLTR in particular will have an overall favorable increase under a blue wave, while JMIA is just too similar to Alibaba to ignore right now. They are one earnings-beat away from mooning.

As always, do you own DD, and Happy 2021!

$15k in NIO shares and $62k in calls purchased starting $42 last week,0.97,,2021-01-04 21:27:26
"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's (and recent) market driving news (Jan 4, 2021 after market close)",0.99,"* 2021 starts off with a bang as VIX shoots up an ungodly 22%+ during intraday high. During intraday low for the market, the Dow was down as much as -700 pts (-2.3%), Nasdaq -345 pts (-2.6%), and S&P -94 (-2.5%). WSB reeled in horror as stonk somehow doesn't always go up. Beyond renewed COVID fear, market sell-off accelerated in the morning after 10 AM as the market continues to keep an eye on the GA run-off election with polls increasingly being more favorable for the DNC candidates. No doubt an extra wrench was thrown to the GA GOP Senate campaigns as POTUS continues to pressure GA officials on figuring out votes - cuz that's totes normal thing for a sitting President to do.

* For those WSBer who failed basic HS civics class, just one GOP win in the two run-off Senate seats will keep Biden's more progressive agenda at bay (and likely the recent tax cut intact) as the GOP and McTurtle retain control of the Senate. Conversely, Dems winning both seats will secure both legislative branch for Dems, as VP Harris be the tie breaking vote in the Senate. Will this mean an eventual bigger stimulus package? A renew market-sell off? Should ANTM, UNH, and others quiver in fear? Find out later this week as results will unlikely be clear even after polls are close on Tues night.

* With renewed COVID fear as the UK variant likely running rampant undetected in the US, shares of travel sector are pressured today. In airlines, AAL closed down -4% to $15.13, UAL -3.75% to $41.63, and LUV -3.37% to $45.04 (similar price action across the sector for JBLU, SAVE, etc.). Cruise stocks took a bigger beating with NCLH down -6.69% to $23.73, RCL down -5.23% to $70.72, and CCL down -5.91% to $20.38. Conversely, safe plays and essential stores such as WMT, TGT, and COST are all up today at 1.65%, 0.62%, and 0.89% despite S&P being red.

* Jack Ma, Alibaba's very public CEO has reportedly been missing in action in the past few months as speculation starts floating about his disappearance due to the CCP. While memes float about of Ma being tucked away in a Chinese state prison with Randy Marsh due to pissing off Pooh Bear, shares of BABA continues to be pressured despite a rebound last week as CCP's antitrust probe on both Alibaba and its subsidiary Ant Group chugs on. BABA closed the day -2.10% at $227.85, while competitors PDD closed -6.13% to $166.78, and JD closed the day -1.79% at $86.33. 

*  QS, the SPAC turned meme EV stock took a nice more than -40% dive today as shares sold off on... well, who the fuck knows why it sold off (PIPE shares became available and are no longer locked? I didn't look into the lockup period, someone let me know the dates). The EV battery maker took on a NKLA-like trajectory and rallied as high as $120 before steadily trimming its gains in the past week. For those who are adventurous in selling the IV, OTM Jan 15 puts such as 35p are going for $1.55 while 40p are going for $3.3. But honestly, do you really want to baghold QS at those pricing if assigned (cash secured)? Go with a spread, you dumb fuck. Shares closed the day down more than $34 (-40.84%) to $49.96. If you sold puts before today, you dun goofed.

* QS edit: thanks to trojanattorney1 [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqi8e8/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_and_recent_market_driving/gi48nvd/): more early investor shares were available today and millions were dumped into the market. If you're trying to catch the QS knife, be warned as there are many more dilution to go. You can check recent filing [here](https://sec.report/Ticker/QS) if you're so inclined.

*  Haven, the AMZN + BRK + JPM venture in ""disrupting"" health care has disbanded after a 3 year attempt. Turns out having sensible health care in America is hard as fuck. Shares of healthcare companies UNH, HUM, et al. were up during pre-market and morning hours, but faded through the day as overall macro pushed the sector down.

*  In more ""I thought this is America"" news, more than 200 GOOGL employees and contractors in both the US and Canada have decided to unionized to promote a less shitty workplace and ethical business practices (once a upon a time, Google's motto was ""Do No Evil.""). Collectively known as the Alphabet Workers Union, the group's aim is to start small and eventually amass enough membership to actually address some of the more lofty goals: namely pay and working conditions. GOOGL closed the day down -1.51%, though more likely due to overall macro than this thus far non-material news.

*  Elon chan and his meme stock continues to kill whatever remaining short sellers are left, as TSLA reaches new ATH after Q4 delivery report. Despite the FY number being ""missed"" by 450 vehicles, the quarterly delivery of 180,570 vehicles handily beat Wall Street's estimate of about 174k vehicles and shares are up bigly to close up 3.42% at $729.77. How did we ever doubt those WSB degens who loaded up $3,500 strike Jan 15 calls pre-split which are now ITM!? Truly, they were ahead of the times in knowing that TSLA will shoot up an additional 76% in the next 3 months.

*  On Chinese EV side of things, NIO delivered 7k vehicles in Dec 2020 while XPEV delivered 5,700 vehicles - both numbers are record ""growth"" for the two company which shows a YoY growth of 121% for NIO and 326% for XPEV. (WSB with OTM FDs know these ""growth"" well as their FDs goes from 100% in value but are still down all-time of at -85%). NIO closed the day up 9.75% to $53.49 and XPEV trimmed their intraday high of 10%+ to close up 2.97% at $44.10.

*  In WSB meme stock land, things are a fairly mixed bag as GME continues to fade after reaching a recent 52-week high of $22.35. The definitely-not-going-bankrupt gaming retailer closed the day down -8.44% to $17.25. PLTR, despite being up more than 2% in pre-market, closed the day relatively flat at -0.76% to $23.37. Finally, steel gang got a respite today as MT closed the day up 4.59%, though intraday high was up as much as 8%.

*  Looking for cheap and relatively ""responsible"" WSB meme stock play? You can do GME covered call and sell April 35c for about $1.6 (though selling on a green day for $2+ is probably a better idea). This will net you 100 shares of GME for less than $15.70 per share and cap your imaginary gains at $35 if the squeeze does happen. (All those GME DDs can't be wrong?)  Conversely, you can go with GME April 20c/35c debit call spread for a ""low price"" of $2.4 per spread, or for those who prefer to sell FDs to fellow WSBer, poor man's covered call of Jan 2022 $25c and selling weeklies and/or April 35c will suffice. At the end of the day, the fact that April 35c has so much value still to it should be taken advantage if GME has a green day. For MT, June debit call spread is probably the way to go, with 25c/35c a possible spread. These are not financial advice and if you listen to a random stranger online and lose your pants on the play - then that's on you, you dumb stupid motherfucker.

*  DJI closed down -382 pts (-1.25%), IXIC closed down -189 pts (-1.47%), SPX -55 pts (-1.48%), and RUT is down -28 pts (-1.47%). Notable numbers and ERs this week: ISM manufacturing index tomorrow at 10 AM ET, BBBY reports on Thursday before market opens while MU reports after market close. Load up on those MU 90c for 7/20 - this time it'll definitely hit!

"Stock Market News for Today | TSLA, NIO, LMND, FUBO, ROKU & Other Stock Market News [01-04]",0.88,"**Stocks end 2020 on the high note with Tesla closing over 700$. Is Lemonade overvalued? FuboTv keeps on crumbling while NIO posts great sales numbers, let‚Äôs talk about this & other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of the last trading day of 2020, as we saw both the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/bHgX2sf) and the [Dow Jones Industrial](https://ibb.co/D471c7X) finish up over 0.60% and finishing at record highs, while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/vzGgSBb)  finished barely up for the day, gaining .14%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/2YrvMpT) finishing just down for the day, but it‚Äôs still up from a [week](https://ibb.co/LxdGJ8c) ago, as the volatility still remains way above the [levels](https://ibb.co/XbWkzW4) before March when it rose to over 80.

We just about saw a positive ratio of companies [advancing](https://ibb.co/5TwrM2m) to close out the year as the volume was belove average with just 100 new highs, as we saw 10 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/yyrTGGP) finishing in the green with Utilities, Financials, Real Estate & Health Care gaining more than 1% while Energy was the only sector to finish the day with a loss.  
We also saw most factor groups [finishing](https://ibb.co/dmvNJgL) the day in the red with only Large-Cap Value companies posting a gain of .3%, as you can see in Thursday‚Äôs [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/wBGr7cR) with gains all around the board, while losses were concentrated in the Biotech and Oil & Gas industry.

Here is the weekly [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/zQWD12B) with names like Alibaba, Shopify, Palantir, Square and Zoom being some of the biggest losers, while TESLA continued to push higher as Tesla finished the month of [December](https://ibb.co/ZX09X8Z) with a gain of more than 20% as you can see here, while many of the other big tech names also had a strong month, with most of the losses being concentrated in the communication sector and of course Alibaba which was hit by a lot of negative news.

We also [finished](https://ibb.co/r5JRk5b) the year with most sectors in the green as you can see here, led by Technology, Consumer Cyclicals and Communications. But gains were had in most other sectors as well, except the Financial, Travel and Energy sectors, which finished the year down.

The biggest [losers](https://ibb.co/nDgRs1S) in the SP500 which finished the year up more than 16% were by far stocks like Carnival, OXY, Norwegian Cruise Line, United Airlines and many more others. The Nasdaq 100 wasn‚Äôt safe either despite jumping almost 50% in 2020, having the best gains in 11years, with companies like Walgreens, Fox and Intel posting losses of over 17%, while the Dow was the laggard finishing just over 7% up for the year as Boeing, Chevron and Intel dragged the index lower.

We also saw huge [winners](https://ibb.co/n7yP7cM)  in 2020, as the SP500 was led higher by stocks like Apple, Nvidia, PayPal, Amazon and many others that posted huge gains. While the Nasdaq 100 jumped to record highs lead by Tesla which posted an incredible year with other stocks like Moderna, Peloton & Zoom also rising by more than 300%. The Dow also had big winners but still lagged as the biggest gainers here were the tech giants Apple & Microsoft joined by some other stocks like Nike, Disney & Salesforce.

We also got some economic data since Thursday as Macau‚Äôs gaming [revenue](https://ibb.co/NWBrC3s) continued the slow recovery, but the visits in the travel dependent region were 20% higher in the Holiday period compared to the start of December, which may be another positive sign for the Macau Gambling business.

Meanwhile we also received the latest jobless [numbers](https://ibb.co/Km8px8X), which dipped below 800K again, 19K less than last week and more than 40K less than expected, as the continuing jobless claims also fell to just over 5.2M more than 100K better than expected and the previous [report](https://ibb.co/gJLQYPB).

While this [week](https://ibb.co/mDnXFZY) we start to receive important economic data that alongside the results of the Georgia runoff election might push the market either to more gains, or if the results and data don‚Äôt show up as investors & analysts expected it, we might see an increase in volatility again which will lead to a market pullback or correction, which in my opinion would be a good time to go out and find deals to buy again.

We also really don‚Äôt get any significant [earnings](https://ibb.co/60QM77h) releases this week, with most of the interesting ones like Micron, Walgreens & Bed Bath & Beyond coming on Thursday.

So, in some other stock market news, Tesla topped [expectations](https://ibb.co/g9048Ry) of 163K deliveries in Q4 again but did finish just shy of the 500K mark. The company delivered more than 180K vehicle in the last quarter, as we saw [Tesla](https://ibb.co/th7Hhnc)  pricing the model Y at just over $50.000 in China and are expecting to start deliveries this month as they keep expanding their sales in the world‚Äôs biggest car market, as they are targeting to make this their biggest market surpassing the US. Tesla closed over 700$ for the first time and if you want to see my opinion on this stock, check out my prediction on Tesla [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kci2lk/my_tesla_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/).

Some other EV makers from China also posted sales numbers with [Li Auto](https://ibb.co/LYCSs1N) increasing deliveries five-fold year/year with a 32% increase month/month in December, while [XPENG](https://ibb.co/Zc7FSQC) also announced record delivery numbers up 35% month/month and more than 300% year/year for December. We also saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/4VWGX78) posting a monthly deliveries record of just over 7K, up over 120% year/year and finishing the year with over 43K deliveries, which were also up over 110% year/year, as they are also planning on revealing some new sedan models and their latest developments on self-driving and other technologies next week.

Meanwhile we saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/dKh6kx0) take a ride after another short-seller released a statement, pointing out to the final lock-up period after the IPO, as a moment that will bring huge selling to this stock, despite the [company](https://ibb.co/YWksq6g) needing just over 4 years to reach the first million customers, less than 5 times the time it took companies like StateFarm, Geico and Allstate to reach their first million. I personally am an investor in this company, and I really like what they are doing, so I am not going to sell my shares anytime soon.

Guys, personally I can‚Äôt wait to see the sales numbers and how the services business is growing for [Apple](https://ibb.co/cx07jJs) as the top-of-the-line products keep having great demand, but we do have to see what happens in the US-China relations, as this could impact the Apple revenue stream, this after the New York Stock Exchange has [started](https://ibb.co/599nrxc) the process of delisting telecom giants from China.

We also saw a [memo](https://ibb.co/qyBfzrq) from DELTA‚Äôs CEO, as he expects the company to return to positive cashflow in the spring, as they are planning to start paying down debt as soon as that happens to reduce the burden the company has taken on since March 2020.

Meanwhile [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/Dg5jZ6x) continues its sharp decline after a number of firms have started to short the stock pointing to insane valuations and outlook.

NIO $50 Call 01/15 bought at 2x its current value. Thoughts?,0.84,"Hello fellow retards,

In mid-November, I made a very stupid purchase and bought $50c with Jan 15 exp at $8.35. 

My call went down as much as 64% as of Dec 28, but I held. In the past week, it‚Äôs gained close to 30%. Overall, the call is now worth $4.15, ~50% below my purchase price.

Given the recent great news regarding December and 4Q20 deliveries as well as NIO day on Jan 9, what do you think I should do with my call? 
- Hold until then to limit my losses given the uptrend? or 
- Do you think it‚Äôs worth roll it over to March-May call?

Thanks retards!

Something to feed your confirmation bias on Nio,0.82,"Nio's expansion to Europe has been discussed a lot. Many expressed doubts that Europeans would buy a Chinese car given all the negative stereotypes. From 2021, Germany introduced a CO2 tax (7c per liter) and till 2025 they give 9000 Euros for purchasing a EV. My main problem with German EVs is that they have an abysmal range. VW promises something up to 220km. I drove BMW i3 and whatever they promise there, the truth is that it's around 170 km and the charging takes like 9 hours. Why the hell do I need a car with such a range? 

Nio offers a range up to 900 km. Wow. That's something to consider. But what about the Chinese quality and as a potential German customer who got screwed over by the government's CO2 tax right on the New Year's day I decided to google what German reviews say on Nio:

ADAC praises Nio quality and price, specifying that 70% of materials are from renowned producers like Bosch

https://www.adac.de/rund-ums-fahrzeug/autokatalog/marken-modelle/auto/nio-es6/

Another very positive review stating that it has some problems with being adjusted to the European standards and market but in general it's a good car for German roads and is much cheaper than a comparable Audi

https://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/fahrbericht/nio-es6-guenstiger-elektro-suv/

Another generally positive review. They point out that the battery is not suitable for a speed of over 120km/h which is a big problem for Germany's autobahn as 120 km/h is the annoying grandma speed here. However, other European countries have a speed limit so it might be less of a problem

https://www.autobild.de/artikel/nio-es6-performance-2022-test-preis-deutschland-reichweite-technische-daten-elekrtro-suv-17098037.html

Tl;dr German reviewers praise Nio for its price, quality and driving experience. The main disadvantage is that it is not fulfilling for some Europe-specific demands. However, if Nio adapts to those requirements, it will be a recommendable car.

Citron was wrong about NIO. Tesla Model Y in China is priced higher ($52 k) than rumored ($49 k).,0.9,"Government subsidies only apply to EV that cost less than 300,000 yuan ($45,920) so the model Y doesn‚Äôt qualify.  

However, since NIO has swapping stations, NIO qualifies for $2-3k in subsidies.  The starting price for NIO is $56 k before subsidies (or $46 k if they decide to lease the battery).

https://cntechpost.com/2021/01/01/china-made-tesla-model-y-goes-on-sale-price-from-about-52000/

Update:  

Analysts predicted the price for the Model Y could be as low as $41 k:

‚ÄúLeft argues NIO is vulnerable to Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model Y pricing in China. Where analysts thought a price tag of $56,000 to $73,000 for the Model Y would be problematic for NIO's ES6 hatchback, analysts now believe Tesla could price it as low as $41,000, which hammers even harder at NIO's valuation relative to its rival.‚Äù

Calls on Nigerian Scam Jumia - $90K Buy In,0.83,"  

[position proof](https://i.imgur.com/We4aZF0.jpeg)

**IPO and Shitron** 

I guess to start off Ill preface with the Shitron and Jumia IPO dilemma. Andrew Left is a short seller being used a signal for short and distort attacks that he may be in cohorts with, with other funds. The idea of him being a single individual with poor grammatical prowess is a front. Based on borrow fees it is likely Left and friends shorted at IPO with possession of information that he gained either through corroboration with others, purchased, etc. He released the hit piece that I summarize and comment on below. That hit piece took JMIA from $50 to $2. The reason for such a violent decline is multifactored, that derives from the Citron report, legitimate financial struggles, and lastly (but just as important) is just how low the JMIA float is. They IPO‚Äôd with just 13 Million shares. A short and distort attack on a stock that will inherently already be volatile, is what did JMIA in. There were not enough shares to go around, making it easier to manipulate. Coincidentally (or not) it was one of the first plays on Citrons new hedge fund. Jumia did have a recent dilution, but they still sit as one of the lowest multi-billion-dollar companies in the market in regards to share float. It puts them along the lines of SEB and BRKA. To put things in perspective the float of your favorite meme stock (e.g., QS, NIO, etc. is anywhere from 10 to 200 times larger).

[https://imgur.com/a/gXRAeYS](https://imgur.com/a/gXRAeYS)

&#x200B;

In summary of the report Shitron and Co. claimed the following

**Securities Fraud and Smoking Gun**

Accuses JMIA of wanted to do what every other IPO is interested in which is raising funds and allowing original investors to exit. The modus operandi of Rocket Internet is to start these startups and exit early on them. The MTN exit was likely related to debt reduction as around that time they were ordered to pay over $1B USD in fines to Nigeria. They also tried to tack on the sale of Konga by Naspers, that it being a 90% loss is a signal. This is actually not true as the sale was undisclosed, there is NO source that this was what was lost. However, if we assume it‚Äôs true Naspers a $90B dollar company lost less than $80 million on Konga, based on its total investments. 

http://www.chinagoabroad.com/en/article/r20-billion-jumia-ipo-could-help-mtn-reduce-debt-burden

**They claim to present ‚Äúsome of many MATERIAL DISCREPANCIES‚Äù, which we can assume what is presented is the WORST discrepancy that exists:**

**Claimed that the 20%-30% discrepancy in users in filings is fraud:**

This statement was unsourced with a link, claiming it came from an ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù source. Realistically the data was separated by over a span of 6 months (or two quarters). Since being listed and reporting users this has been the average growth in users falling in line with the alleged discrepancy in user data. There has also been commentary that this is more of a reporting issue in terms of differing definition of sellers/merchants.

**High returns, failed deliveries, and cancellations:**

The return rate of 14% is actually not that high. Retail products at the consumer level have high return rates. The failed delivery rate is a result of the cash system that is employed in some communities. It requires a person to person confirmation, lack of communication results in a high number of failed deliveries. He later mentions this and sources the SEC document that this also results in financial losses in terms of delivery payment theft, but doesn‚Äôt mention that literally directly after that statement, that the issue has been corrected with the development of a payment processor.

https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/10/growing-online-sales-means-more-returns-and-trash-for-landfills.html

**History of fraud in Nigeria**

The source on this is an odd one, but regardless of validity, the amount allegedly stolen was small ($4m) and neither employee is still employed. The stock market is filled with companies that are thriving with past, present, and future reports of fraud at significantly higher magnitudes. 

In terms of the sketchy sale to Jeremy hondra, I cannot find a source on it, not even the quotes. So, I can‚Äôt comment on it in-depth, but I will say that ‚Äú$1‚Äù business sales are not unheard of. It's likely those businesses were losing significantly more than $3m a year and JUMIA and its other investors thought it was worthwhile to bring back, or it was a part of whatever agreement existed between the two.

**Lack of audit**

The stock was underwritten by JP Morgan and others, it would be in their financial interest that everything checks out with JMIA. Shitron implies in their statements that the alleged Nigerians under Ernst and Young (EY) can‚Äôt perform an audit. In the same document EY says they conduct audits to the standard of the ‚ÄúPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB‚Ä¶ Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.

They go on to say that 

‚ÄúAs part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over **financial reporting** but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company‚Äôs internal control. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the **financial statements**, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.‚Äù

The report makes it seem like it's an unaudited business. The source link doesn‚Äôt even take you to the right page. Either way audits of Jumia are currently available. 

https://www.annualreports.com/HostedData/AnnualReports/PDF/NYSE\_JMIA\_2019.pdf

**Long Perspective**

With that being said Andrew Left and friends recently reversed their opinion and gave it a $100 price target. Some say it is genuine others think it's just to double dip and short it again. I personally don‚Äôt give a fuck what his intentions are. In the short term, it‚Äôs a part of what caused Octobers the run-up, in the long run, ‚Äústonks only go up‚Äù. But more seriously, citron‚Äôs value is using his career clout to acquire information, and strategically short these companies. Its not really in his MO to change opinions publicly unless he wants that information to be publicly held. In the sense that he wants the public to know and as a trader you understand that‚Äôs that what he wants, but I never really think past that. 

As for JMIA I‚Äôm going to save the talk on ‚ÄúAfrican Amazon‚Äù, especially considering amazon income is from being a cloud computing company more than it is a retail store. Also, while I disagree with Citron‚Äôs allegations, I do agree with the theme that Jumia is dysfunctional. But I‚Äôve only ever made money off dysfunction, and the dysfunction of Jumia is just a reflection of Nigeria and not JUMIA the company. In fact, I take Jumia‚Äôs ability to function in Nigeria as a positive sign. While they‚Äôve hemorrhaged money in the past and continue to do so they are on the path to profitability, with EPS increasing quarter after quarter, and little long term and short-term debt. The value of Jumia has been linked to the expected growth of Nigeria but I have zero hope in Nigeria. The value of Jumia will actually be in its expansion in east and north Arica. Amazon has already in the region of North Africa with its buyout of souq. Net Income for Jumia is still increasing YoY in these regions as well with increased usage of Jumia‚Äôs payment processor. Online retail shopping will increase with increasing global access to the internet, especially with the maturation of starlink. The processor and logistics is also where I see the growth occurring especially if both services break away from being a Jumia exclusive, and becomes involved in some of the industrializations of parts of Africa. They have an upcoming earnings report Feb 9th that I believe it‚Äôll hit ATH around said date. Over the past few months, institutions have been buying it heavily prior to the earnings. Part of the anticipation is increased adoption of JumiaPay under covid.

Canoo Stop or GOEV,0.87,"I‚Äôve originally posted this DD in another sub but given it‚Äôs popularity a few people have asked me to post it in r/wallstreetbets as well. I was a bit hesitant at first because one of my post got removed by the mods when this company was still a SPAC. But now since December 22nd it is trading on the Nasdaq as a new public company with the ticker GOEV.

This post may or may not be removed by the mods but here you go as requested. 

I‚Äôm a former sell side professional for a big firm so my methodology is based on my experience and the information publicly available including data and financial projections published by the company. In consequence I have less data and insight than insiders and early Hedge Funds investors. This is my personal view and not a recommendation of any sort.

Prerequisite is that you already know the basics of Canoo which is a Californian based EV company pre production and pre revenue. Their unique selling points include a proprietary steer-by-wire skateboard technology so they can interchange ‚Äútop hats‚Äù and develop new vehicles much faster and a subscription-only business model for their first B2C lifestyle vehicle. They also have B2B EV on a more classic selling scheme. 

I invite you to read the top comments from the OP as they contain valuable developments. 

**The Market Cap and New Shares Issuance**

Based on SEC filings the number of shares of new Canoo is as follows:

* 175M held by old Canoo shareholders (including management and employees)
* 32.325M held by PIPE
* 37,307,189 Hennessy C A C converted to GOEV which for now represents the only tradable shares at this time

To which we need to add shares that could be issued in the next weeks:

* 36,092,750 warrants (ratio 1 warrant for 1 share) of which 22,511,250 public and 13,581,500 private
* 15M Earnout Shares for management: three lots of 5M shares each at Milestones for share price to reach $18 $25 and $30

aggregating all these elements and only 5M Earnout Shares so far we get 285,724,939 outstanding shares ; at $14.50 per share that‚Äôs a market cap of $4.14bn. Note that you would get an extra dilution of 1.7% for every 5M new Earnout Shares issued. Also there is a lack of transparency until Canoo produces a new SEC filing in which the company update the exact number of outstanding shares. For instance when I check market cap on IBKR it would tell me $3.6bn and a totally wrong number of shares. I did not find any info about the PIPE lock period to hold their shares. In fact these kind of deals can remain undisclosed for a certain time. But some large pre existing shareholders including founders, directors, holders of 3%+ pre-SPAC have deals to hold their shares for a total of 116.2M for a period in between 6M to 12M after the Closing of the Business Combination (21-Dec-20).

**Chairman Tony Aquila vs CEO Ulrich Kranz**

I want to address this subject early in this thread for three reasons. First it is not discussed enough on the internet. Second it potentially has massive implications in the public perception of the company. And third insiders and HF have a massive advantage if they know what drama is going on amid the board. I believe it was first reported by The Verge dot com so I‚Äôll quote them on the matter:

Aquila told The Verge the company‚Äôs immediate focus has changed. ‚ÄúWhen I invested in [Canoo], I didn‚Äôt invest in it for the lifestyle vehicle. To me, I saw that as a derivative, but that the real asset was this multipurpose delivery platform,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe way I would look at it is this is a re-founding of the company, just kind of like Elon did to Tesla‚Äù. Aquila, who comes from a finance and software background, invested $35M in Canoo this summer through his firm before the merger and before he was elevated to chairman. ‚ÄúHe put money in [Tesla], just like I did, became the chair, had a different vision, comes out of the tech world. So I can completely relate and appreciate what he‚Äôs done for the industry.‚Äù

Founders always intended to use the van‚Äôs modular platform to power other vehicles, but Aquila is supercharging that vision by accelerating those plans.

With that in mind, there are changes being made to corporate structure. Ulrich Kranz, one of the BMW executives who co-founded Canoo and the current CEO, is no longer on the company‚Äôs board of directors. He‚Äôll instead be a ‚Äúspecial adviser‚Äù to Aquila, and while he‚Äôll remain CEO, his contract was renegotiated and now includes language that accounts for the possibility of him being replaced (SEC filings). 

‚ÄúI want to build a world class company here, and what I‚Äôve said to everyone is, look, you‚Äôre going to go as far in this company and as big as this company as we all collectively do. But it‚Äôs like a baseball team. Everybody‚Äôs got to play their position and they‚Äôve got to play it really well for every season, and those positions can change over time,‚Äù Aquila told The Verge when asked about Kranz‚Äôs new contract. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs definitely a role [for Kranz]. There‚Äôs definitely advice that can happen. But to scale an organization at this level, I mean, that‚Äôs a different experience than he has.‚Äù

And they add: For what it‚Äôs worth, if Kranz is removed as CEO but remains as Aquila‚Äôs adviser, his salary will more than triple from $648K to $2.5M. [end of quote]

Now, it is up to the market and every single investor to ultimately judge this move. What is irrefutable although is that it injects a lot of uncertainty to the company at a very sensible time when they just turned public. My personal opinion is I don‚Äôt like at all. I am way more confident with an individual as Kranz who has co-founded the company, who used to be the boss of Project i at BMW. He led the release of the gorgeous i8 and the i3 who are arguably among the most iconic EV produced by traditional automakers. He‚Äôs an engineer with a long track-record in the auto industry and he sounds humble. On the other hand you have a late investor who didn‚Äôt do anything significant in the industry who just ousted Kranz from the board. And to add insult to injury he dares compare himself to Papa Musk.

Now imagine you have millions on the line. A company pre revenue. Egocentric chairman who is trying to be the new Elon. And you got in at $10 per unit with a free 1-for-1 warrant to ride. You can easily imagine it makes sense taking profit and move to the next play. While still having exposition to price appreciation thanks to the warrants. To finish on this point the Investor Presentation and the original YouTube videos presented Kranz as the face of the company. But the latest video on the B2B EV is all about Aquila bragging.

**The Price Action vs Value**

The hot question right now is how low the share price can fall. It‚Äôs 14.50 at the time of my writing. And it basically been red every single day since the initial GOEV quote on Nasdaq on December 22nd. It actually opened +20% on that day and rallied to 14.90 +27% (10c below the 15.00 Milestone to unlock a new 5M potential issuance to management) but then sharply (maybe surprisingly?) reversed to finish the day negative.

I‚Äôll go quickly about valuation because it is solely based on financial projections provided by the company in the Investor Presentation to the SEC in August 2020. I agree that they proposed conservative assumptions although there is obviously a variety of risks which could prevent them to reach their goals. On a DCF model you get 3 scenarii with $12.25 $18.50 and $24.50 price targets low mid high (before any dilution / new shares) on a 20% discount rate. Interestingly the SOTP model including a Netflix type of business model / margins for the B2C would bring you to a $35.75 per share. 

That‚Äôs based on what they knew about themselves in the summer. Closer to the Business Combination date they have raised their guidance: Hennessy said on 7 Dec: ‚ÄúSince announcing the transaction, Canoo has seen substantial growth in consumer demand and significant interest from potential partners in its proprietary market leading EV platform and underlying technologies. Canoo is efficiently allocating capital by leveraging this platform and has identified new opportunities significantly increasing its TAM (total addressable market) in both B2B and B2C (business to customer) end markets. We have never been more excited about the future of Canoo and look forward to closing our planned merger later in December.‚Äù

There is a clear disconnection between the perceived discounted value of the company and the probably exaggerated beating the share price is taking since it is floating as a new Canoo. Undoubtedly a lot of paper handed retail investors have been shaken - some of them at a loss. But again that‚Äôs the Risk and Reward of a SPAC play in general and furthermore through merger. It is designed for HF to make risk-less money in exchange of lending large amounts for the initial SPAC-IPO. Nobody wants to pay the bill once the redemption window has closed.

If you are a mid long term believer in Canoo the brand then $15 a share is cheap for what this company could become - all things equal. 

**The Vision**

When I imagine an individual vehicle in the near future I for sure think of a non-fossil energy one. So EV or any sustainable energy are the sense of history. But what about consumption habits?

It used to be: you buy a car you lose circa 20% VAT value as soon as you‚Äôve paid the check  + an extra % of value instantly destroyed because it becomes a second-hand product without a natural price appreciation (as opposed to a house or a Swiss manufactured watch). You have to take care of it, insure it and when you don‚Äôt need it anymore you need to engage time, effort, and cost to resell it. 

I can totally see their B2C business model playing out: you download an app, you register, you choose your skin, you pay $599 a month (maybe less?) and you go driving your EV. Insurance, caretake, charging included. Once you‚Äôve bored of it you finish your month and that‚Äôs it. No more liability no headache. The next step being the car drives itself to a certain degree. Which they also incorporated as about-to-be-ready (2.5 autonomy out of 5). But apparently that‚Äôs not good enough for Aquila who wants to push B2B. I have the feeling the stock is being partly punished for his arrogance. 

**The PR and Marketing**

See for yourself. Go on their insta and YouTube and compare with the other EV competitors outside of the whales Tesla and so on. They are above. They took communication seriously. You can even spot Off-White and Bape skins in one of their promo video. But again they must decide on who will be The Face of their brand. And this decision will be extremely pivotal. They are offering a new lifestyle. Don‚Äôt show off an old irrelevant investor or get punished for it.

One word on American-made: I believe there is a tradition of buying American cars for the American people. So it‚Äôs going to be Tesla on the U.S soil or among the new offering locally designed. I don‚Äôt see Nio and the likes gaining a significant market share over there. That said Canoo has had large Chinese investors stakes before the SPAC.

**The Warrants**

I have witnessed a lot of speculation around them so let‚Äôs have a clearer picture. The company wrote: Each Warrant will become exercisable on the later of 30 days after the completion of the Company‚Äôs initial Business Combination or 12 months from the closing of the Public Offering and will expire five years after the completion of the Company‚Äôs initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.

Once the Warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding Warrants in whole and not in part at a price of $0.01 per Warrant upon a minimum of 30 days‚Äô prior written notice of redemption, only in the event that the last reported sale price of the Company‚Äôs shares of Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within the 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the Warrant holders. [end of quote]

I know it‚Äôs not that easy to read so let me go straight to the point. GOEVW (so the Warrant) will be exercisable once both these 2 events have passed. Initial SPAC-IPO (5-Mar-19) +12months so 5-Mar-20 so that has passed we clear. And Business Combination was on 21-Dec-20 +30days = on 21st January 2021 the Warrant will be exercisable. The company can not redeem the warrants before they are exercisable. 

So I personally don‚Äôt see any sophisticated scheme here. They are 1 for 1 ratio with an exercise price of $11.50. The intrinsic value is 3.00 when GOEV is 14.50. They have ranged 3.20 3.82 today with a now price of 3.45 (on 14.50 ref). So the extra 0.45 is comparable to the time value in options. The expiry is quite far on 25-Sep-25 so the time decay or theta burn is negligible on a daily basis. Altogether that could be an indication that warrant holders are not panicking and not dumping their W for a discount and estimate that GOEV is credible enough to trade above 11.50 on a long haul.

1.  Tesla is its only real competition right now, (Except for Nio as well in the chinese market)
2.  Its a few grand cheaper than a Tesla, but also less features.  (Which is good because it has a hefty profit margin) 
3.  Has a nice EV credit to go with it.  (Ford can pull a tesla and sell EV credits as well)
4.  Has the Ford distribution chain, which is 10x larger than Tesla, with more reach.
5.  Ford will have 0 issues with production like Tesla tends to have
6.  It will be selling globally in 2021, so massive potential in China, especially since nobody in China knows what a ""Mustang"" car is and its significance so it won't have the same branding issues like it does in America.
7. Produced in Mexico so it has a better Margin than Tesla.  
8.  It obviously isn't going to cannibalize their own sales in anyway, but will take away from Tesla.

DD PSA: How to avoid getting fooled by a company like Nikola again,0.96,"Alright, knuckleheads. I know this isn't school, so I'll try to make this easy to understand and impart some of my limited aCtUaL kNoWleDgE upon this community in return for all you've given me.

NKLA happened, and NKLA will happen again. There's a million ways to slice, dice, and wife profits off a meme stock like that, but my favorite way to create a long forecast on a fast-rising techie company is to **look at the company's IP holdings**.

Companies (especially startups growing out of diapers and getting ready to shit the bed) have great incentive to patent anything and everything they can. Patents prove the company is working on R&D, hired competent people, and has legal chops hovering feverishly. It gives them license to wave their dick around in the market space. Nikola's IP portfolio can be likened to Trevor Milton's bulge: ^(it's) ^(tiny.)

There are three easy ""types"" of patents.

1. Granted: ""real"". Legally sound. Valid for 20 years.
2. Pending: not ""real"", can turn real, valid for like a year.
3. Design: for design. Apple has many. Nikola needs none.

Nikola has like 9 patents (a minuscule amount for a company of its former stature) and almost all of them are design, or ""D"" patents. D patents are for Jonny Ive and the ghost of Steve Jobs' OCD. If a small company like Nikola or whatever goddamn meme stock you want to suck off this week has majority D patents, take a page out of Forrest's book and run. **You want a company with a history of turning pending patents into granted ones.** Even if it's a ""new"" company splooging all over the scene, I guarantee they've been producing IP for eons. If they haven't, that's a red flag big enough to cripple Lana Rhoades. If it breaks her, I fucking promise it'll break your margin account too. 

Patents should be

1. of the same volume as comparable companies in your meme stock's size and market space and
2. aligned with what the company says it's doing

Patents are forward-thinking documents. Companies want them to be viable and maybe even cutting edge 5, 10, 15 years down the line. You know what doesn't stay current for that amount of time? The design of a semi. Vehicles get redesigned year-to-year and substantially about every 5. You know what Trevor Fuckton decided to patent? A bunch of useless design patents protecting the contours on his DOA load of gravity-defying shit. And guess what? His company is garbage. Patents are a huge tell. **Good news for you addicts: NIO has a normal-looking patent portfolio.** Are they good quality? I'm not gonna look. But maybe you can.

**TL;DR since I know you want one:** My bidet's control panel is protected by more patents than Nikola has to its name. That's never a good sign. Do your dd. Love you idiots.",2020-12-29 20:58:40

Nio day is gonna send NIO through the moon and to the stars,0.92,"Nio day is coming on January 9th, and that is when nio will be announcing their new autonomous driving system, a new sedan model, new battery technology, and possibly more info on their expansion to Europe. They partnered with Mobileye for there new autonomous driving technology have said their new autonomous driving system is better than any other system out there, which could mean level 4 autonomy. This would be HUGE, as they would be the first company to reach level 4 autonomy, even ahead of TSLA. Those are just the things they have told us about, likely that there's more they will be announcing that we don't know about yet. Nio has been consolidating at the low 40s since their crazy run up to 50, and is due for another eruption soon. Nio day is the perfect trigger for a nio bull run, along with december vehicle delivery numbers due for Jan 1.

Nio Day Set For Jan. 9: What You Need To Know,0.63,,2020-12-29 02:10:15
NIO will miss 4Q delivery guidance,0.89,"It pains me to write this as I am a NIO bull and believe this company will EXPLODE over the coming year(s), but it is almost guaranteed they will miss 4Q delivery guidance.  See below why.

4Q guidance: 16,500 - 17,000

Oct: 5,055

Nov: 5,291

Dec (To be released Jan 2 or 4): Need 6,154 for low-end of guide, 6,654 for high-end of guide.

Background:

Automotive chip shortage in China: 
A shortage of chips used in auto manufacturing could disrupt automotive production in China well into next year (Dec 4th)
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-car-production-may-face-115148982.html

Nio has been affected by aformentioned chip shortage - their December production is bottlenecked at ~5,000.  Yes you read that right.  This was mentioned by the president of Nio at the annual communications meeting last week.  See below links.

BROKER: Core Securities

RESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 200,000        DATE REGISTERED: 12/18/2020 
APPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: 12/31/2020

Finally, and more speculative versus the more tangible proof listed above:
Why did Nio (and other EVs for that matter) do the share offering before they released deliveries and even before Nio Day for Nio?  Why would they not wait a few weeks if deliveries would be great and grad a much higher offer price and XXXbillions more?

Seems suspect.

Let me be clear, this is a temporary bottleneck for Dec deliveries and I truly believe Nio is destined to be a massive player in the EV market.  They have all the boxes checked and I am massively bullish.  However, we can't ignore that is going on at the industry level with chip shortages and literally what management mentioned at thier annual communication meeting just a few days ago.  

They said bottlenecked at 5k.  Even if they hit 5.5-6k, that is a massive delivery miss - they will be BELOW the low end of guidance.

Positions 43.5p 1/8/21

I plan on going all in long shortly after - assuming all goes as planned.

From the beginning she was investing in blue chip stocks: Google, Amazon, Apple. But now she almost has 100 shares of Tesla, and wants to buy more instead of diversifying.

Luckily, she doesn't seem to know how to use options, but that could change any day and I have literally lost sleep over this because my mom is getting financial advice from a bunch of idiots from Reddit.

My family is going through some immense personal and financial issues, and I can't believe she rolled over her 401k just to YOLO it all. She was supposed to use that money to pay the mortgage. She's way too old to play with all these risks. And now she won't listen to me because Tesla actually made her money. She doesn't realize she's playing within a bubble, and she has literally no investing strategy. I can't believe I'm the one who is more stressed out about this than she is.

Missed the EV boom? üöÄLithium start-upsüöÄ could be the next tidal wave.,0.86,"**Tl;dr: Read up on Kodal Minerals (KOD: LSE AIM) and consider taking a punt. I am a pure retard and not a financial advisor, take my analysis at your own risk.**

International EV manufacturers have collectively shot to the moon this year. TSLA is likely overvalued, NIO performance has slowed. There are likely to be a range of discrepancies in supporting industries where securities are undervalued (e.g., steel, as recently popularised on this dumbass sub). Undoubtedly, these industries will grow to meet the needs of EV manufacturers as governments set ambitious targets to halt the production of FF vehicles.

Ref 2: [https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-Elon-Musk-Wrong-About-Lithium.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-Elon-Musk-Wrong-About-Lithium.html)

**If you have not considered the lithium market yet, you should**. As manufacturing requirements for lithium rise (for EV li-ion batteries) demand is set to rise dramatically, and current supply is insufficient. As such, there are likely to be a range of lithium mining/exploration start-ups that will do astonishingly well in months and years to come, despite the fact lithium as a commodity has fallen in price. Moreover, as lithium is now in a dip, it is an excellent time to buy into the industry.

I draw your attention to Kodal Minerals (KOD: LSE AIM), a British firm headed by Aussie Bernard Aylward, who comes to the firm with high repute. KOD is a mining & exploration company currently developing a project in Bougouni, Mali, with a whopping 350km¬≤ of potential mining operations, expecting to haul ***1.94 million tonnes*** of lithium over 8 years, with an ***estimated 1.4bn revenue***. The company is currently sat at a **hilarious market cap of ¬£9m, trading at p0.08/share.** The project is in large part funded by Suay Chin, an enormous player in the Chinese lithium market.

I anticipate that as the permit is granted and project action begins, KOD will carry my autistic fucking nut to Pluto.

PLTR - Technical Analysis from a Professional Investor - Update 12/22,0.96,"Told you 25 was the bottom

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kdrvdm/pltr\_technical\_analysis\_from\_a\_professional/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kdrvdm/pltr_technical_analysis_from_a_professional/)

We are going to 40-45, mid January. Originally was targeting beginning of the year because we looked like we were moving 50% faster than the run-up of NIO and about 100% faster than TSLA , now it looks like the moves are about the same as NIO, so a target of 40-45 to late January is a safer bet. This is why I told you guys to use 1/15 and 5/21 calls, because you can roll those with less theta decay.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9ayjurt9xr661.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=aabc196dfa12af7353fb341180c3630f7123f8d7

I rolled half of my 1/15 30 strikes to now 2/19 30 strikes with a slight hit (10% off purchase price) and increased the 2/19 30 strike position by 100%.  Basically increased total option positions by 50% to now 60k. Holding about 130k in shares.

I expect us to be pinned around 27-28 before Christmas, then we'll have another run up to 31-33 when the shorts unwind for the gamma pin on monday/tuesday. Then a pinning of around 29-31 before year end. Then we'll have a large rally for the first 2-3 weeks of January, maybe ahead or after the public demonstration of PLTR.

We are in a game where we push up the value of companies so they clear multiple market cap and liquidity hurdles to be included in various ETFs/indexes, these then create a base level of support, such as with NIO and TESLA, the ultimate of which is inclusion in the S&P500, then really there is not much to the game left. This is why i recommend you sell your TSLA and get into PLTR, because the game is only getting started with PLTR. In the meanwhile we have to contend with various antics of MM who are trying to make sure options expire worthless, which drive interim moves.

If you can't handle the volatility, just buy shares. If you are playing options, be very aware of option expiry dates, gamma positioning through max pain.

**Edit 1: Getting a lot of comments on insider selling post lock-up. It is absolute bullshit. I know you guys can't read, but its literally right in the S-1**

60%+ of the company is owned by Thiel, Karp, Cohen, and SOMPO (A Japanese Strategic who has a JV with Palantir in Japan), none of whom will sell major stakes in the company any time soon.

Out of the cap table about 20% is held by VCs which may need to liquidate due to fund life terms. Half of that is probably going out next year as they appear to be cross fund investments by all these VCs, the earlier vintage funds will have liquidation pressures while the later funds can wait. So maybe half these shares need to be sold in 2021 post lock-up.

Employee option is peanuts. The only thing being sold post lock-up is 10% by the three VCs (Foundrs Fund/Thiel, 8VC and DTS. That is nowhere close to 1 billion shares, it‚Äôs closer to 250 million shares or about 4 days trading volume, which is no big deal. They will be exiting that 10% over likely the course of 6 month/1 year, it won't even make a dent in the market liquidity. ",2020-12-22 17:30:52
Why Gamestop earnings makes sense and this dip is the perfect time to buy. crosspost from my sub /r/GME_Stock,0.8,"EDIT:This DD was deleted a week ago 

For one Shorts love to meme this stock hard af, everytime there is a sharp increase they increase their short stake massively, usually in after hours there is a big increase in value coming from shorts being limited and no news but last earnings report showed how a normal fucking earnings call can put a damper on greedy yolos, Gamestop has been increasing EPS massively for the past 2 quarters by closing down unprofitable stores and increasing online sales optimization doing basic divison of the 250% increase in online sales and the 25% decrease in store sales everyone can see that online sales are a 10th of what store sales but another quarter of this means big positive news.

My final bull case for this stock is the fact that huge jumps in value usually result from catalysts and the best catalyst is upgradings of price action by financial firms this happened with nio multiple times and with xpeng, and i think seeing the profitability increase by 2x coming out of the coronavirus pandemic alot of financial valuing firms with see this and massively upgrade this stock based on it.

PVGO and the reason that tsla shorts keep getting fucked,0.77,"Alright retards, time for class. put on your thinking caps. Im here to explain to you what PVGO is and how it affects stock prices. It is also why TSLA shorts have been getting reamed for the past year, why people are willing to pay $47/share for NIO, and why people pay anything for an unprofitable company like PLTR. You all probably know what it is in essence but don't know the name. So welcome to finance 101

**PVGO is an acronym for Present Value of Growth Opportunities**

Basically, it represents the component of a company‚Äôs stock value that corresponds to the investors‚Äô expectations of growth in earnings. 

[PVGO picture for those who cant read](https://preview.redd.it/w0c6ocetnn661.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a6e116420a0ac8853d48b4274b8ef81845da30d)

In retard speak, PVGO represents the difference between what a company is **fundamentally worth** and what investors **think it should be fundamentally worth in the future.** 

&#x200B;

When it comes to companies like TSLA, everyone has seen the wonderful graph comparing TSLA market cap and cars sold compared to other auto makers. In fact, many think that TSLA is a bubble waiting to pop. The reason they're wrong is PVGO. 

* As long as investors believe in the future of tesla and think they will remain innovative and ambitious, the stock price will not crash hard like people are expecting. 

You can see PVGO in most stocks, from GameStop to Nio to PLTR. The one thing they have in common is that investors *expect* that they will grow, so they *pay for the value of that growth.*",2020-12-22 03:17:50
VLDR (,0.75,"Something something about cornell university saying Lidar isnt required in autonomous cars...

Boomer in the comments:

If Musk changed his mind and said LiDAR is the future then every single person that rails against LiDAR would change their tune too. The argument is not about science. It‚Äôs tribalism. Waymo uses LiDAR but it also uses cameras, radar, and microphones. And Cornell isn‚Äôt even claiming cameras are better ‚Äì just that the are almost as good in most conditions. The ‚Äúaddition‚Äù of LiDAR is undoubtedly better. The question then is cost. Waymo is getting into the LiDAR selling business and has brought the cost down from $75k to $7,500. As the cost comes down and the device becomes more streamlined it might see widespread adoption. I don‚Äôt know the future. And neither does Musk. But right now, the technology is at least marginally better than his best effort and when we are talking about a kid running into the street to grab a ball I‚Äôd rather vehicles have the marginally better technology. Regulators may agree. And again, costs are coming down so his arguments about the cost are becoming less valid and less relevant. And yes, Telsa has a major advantage in real world conditions. But only with cameras and they have no data on LiDAR so they are not light-years ahead of the competition. Not Waymo. And the fact that some people on here think that Tesla‚Äôs autopilot is more than just branding and that other high end apaptive cruise control isn‚Äôt the same‚Ä¶ is scary. Don‚Äôt treat it like autopilot! I like Tesla. I like electric cars. But I don‚Äôt like how science is turning into politics. Let LiDAR technology develop and if it works great. No one should be hoping it fails.

Other than maybe people that have a financial interest in Tesla and don‚Äôt value human life. Also, I don‚Äôt like that Tesla isn‚Äôt working harder to try to open its charging network to non-Tesla. Even charging a premium would be fine but don‚Äôt intentionally stifle EV adoption. Tesla has done the impossible and that‚Äôs great but it doesn‚Äôt mean Musk doesn‚Äôt make mistakes. Look no further than his plan to automate his factories. It failed. But to his credit, he changed positions and admitted his mistake. If LiDAR comes down to sub-$2,000 I‚Äôd be surprised if he doesn‚Äôt adopt it. And while I‚Äôm on an epic rant, Tesla‚Äôs valuation makes no sense to me. I have always thought Tesla would be very successful so it is not that I‚Äôm betting against them. It‚Äôs just that if 10 years from now we have self-driving cars it won‚Äôt make sense to own cars at the same level as today. There will be a decline. And even if Tesla is a leader in autonomous vehicles it doesn‚Äôt seem possible that others won‚Äôt be competing in that space considering how evey car manufacturer has invested in adaptive crusie control tech dev (unlike EV‚Ä¶ which they lagged significantly). And it‚Äôs hard to imagine people will only use Tesla self-driving. Premium will have its place (limos) but people will tend to go with the cheapest functional self driving service ‚Äì that I‚Äôm sure about. So the next 5-10 years should be great but at best‚Ä¶ after that is unknown. At worst, expect car ownership to drop and self driving taxi companies to be a dime a dozen. Too hard to predict which means the value is too high. **The camera detecting autonomous driving systems are like investing in Garmin in the early 2000s because you think navigation systems are the future but ignoring that rise of smartphones with maps. (Smart phones is Lidar for the autists out there that don't get it)**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The above is something i copypasta'd from a boomer.

There's this technology that companies have been working on for years called Lidar.  There's a few companies that have the price around $10k per system but ""that's still too expensive to implement"". When firms like GM / Toyota / Volkswagen start funding these companies the tech gets here faster.

AAPL just said they'll get the best self driving and the best batteries. Kinda seems like they'll contract with QS and VLDR.

&#x200B;

My guess: first the shares (the brokerage doesn't have to exercise calls for this). Then they prioritize soonest to expiring options (Jan). For a given expiration, they'll choose the one that provides the most collateral relief (i.e. the lower strike call because it's worth more).

So the order I'd think is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. However, maybe they only prioritize collateral relief and ignore expirations. If the April 16 $50 was worth more than the Jan 15 $45, then the ordering would change in this case.",2020-12-21 15:14:55

I saw in a post that some of you like the reassurance of a technical analysis, so I figured I'd update you degenerates with some technical analysis on popular stocks (I'll try to do it once every two days) and give you some confidence on your trades. Or you can always ignore them and YOLO 50k and short Coca-Cola :)

Anyway, here comes the analysis: market closed the 19th of December with a bearish candle formation, that doesn't mean that the price will necessarily go down, it always can happen that 1.7 million of people get into Robinhood and buy NIO stocks. EMA doesn't look promising, we might see it go down to the 0.236 Fibonacci level for support, that's also where it'll find the EMA as support too. RSI shows that the stock price is correct, closer to overbought than oversold, but that's fine. It also crossed the resistance it had showing the down trend before the 15th of December, which indicates overall bullishness of the new trend. It looks like a good buy and hold for some days at least, wait to buy at the 0.236 Fib level, that should be 45.7 per share

"Bagholding TSLA, NIO calls over the weekend because I feel asleep",0.79,"I bought some 620c/21/12 and sold some 620c/14/12 calls on tuesday (\~18 cost basis) hoping to make a quick bunch on tesla trading sideways (<650-660) range by the weekend. Were doing good till yesterday until tesla went up crazy and I was expecting for it to come back to earth by today end (which it did). But being the autist I am this is all on robinhood and ofcourse I decide to take a short nap at 10am PST to wake an hour later. Didn't wake up, Robinhood sold my short for (\~49) one hour before close and now I am bagholding it over the weekend with a cost basis of (\~67). Funny thing is if I was awake and this happened, totally would have panic sold at near close but now I am bagholding over the weekend shit scared it will drop. Now I am riding Tesla to the valhalla

PS. Also have some similar NIO 42c 31/12 whose short got sold as well (cost basis 4.75)

PPS I know I am an idiot for doing multi leg stuff on robinhood. Will switch to thinkorswim after new year.

Positions - NIO 42c 31/12, TSLA 620c 21/12 (currently -1700)

FUBO - Gravy Train to Tendy Town,0.9,"Listen up you sad sacks of missing chromosomes, FUBO TV is headed to the Androdema galaxy. In fact, it's ticker stands for ""F*cking Unreal Bigly Options."" I've been printing with PINS, NIO, CRWD, and NET since early 2020 so figured I'd share this next pick.

I know you retards don't read much, so **TLDR: BUY FUBO, it has bigly upside with tiny downside. It's a sports streaming company that fused with a sports betting company.**

**Positions: 1000 shares @ $19.43 avg, 5x Dec 2021 $30 LEAPs.**

For those who can read at a 2nd grade level:

Netflix has regular cable and Fubo TV basically has the market by the nutsack for sports streaming. It's product is smooth, continuously being improved, and people who have it love it. Even though it currently has a $64.99 monthly price, people are still flocking because people who watch sports usually spend most of their time doing that to imagine what their highschool football career could have resulted in. Pathetic, but that's what allows us to ride the gravy train to Androdema.

For perspective, the average revenue per user has gone from 2018: $37.93 2019: $53.73 3rd Quarter 2020: $67.70

Impressive, right? Some may cal that retard strength. What about revenue? 2018: $74.8 million 2019: $146.5 million 2020: BIGLY GROWTH, TBD. Not to mention analysts have been loving this with price targets up to $40.

On top on all this, FUBO is engulfing retards left and right. It combined with Facebank AG, the company who did the Tupac halogram at Coachella and purchased Balto sports, a sports betting company competing with Draftkings. Combine retards watching sports with lots of money since they went into Finance instead of pursuing their true dream and direct marketing for sports betting and you have a Powell money printer.

Stack this with it's Glassdoor info: 91% recommend working at Fubo 100% approve of the CEO, David Gandler

It's been shown time and time again how much influence proper working conditions have on stock growth. When people feel like a team and approve of the CEO, they get retard strength and grow.

Finally, the market cap of this stock is ~$2.5 billion. While this won't be a Netflix with a market cap of $250billion, it is FAR from it's peak.

Hop onto the gravy train straight to tendy town so we can win back our wives.

Otherwise you can eat lead and cram crayons up your ass and say LOL PLTR BABOON FORMATION TA VOODOO 

Here is why you need to buy Canoo (currently it‚Äôs a SPAC with ticker H C A C which kinda sounds like hard cuc and is also a good reason to buy)

- A SPAC named Hennessy for all you cognac sipping wannabees

- Ticker GOEV is memeable beyond reason

- A fucking socialist Tesla with a business model worthy of 2020

- Even boomer analyst firm Roth has set a target at $30 so by using proper DD it should be work six or seven times that because JPenis Morgan sat TSLA at 90USD.

Hopefully you've been holding for at least a month or two and this doesn't come as a surprise to you. There's been great DD on here. H C A C is a SPAC merging with Canoo, an EV company building customizable vehicles for retail, b2b, and industry that rely on a proprietary 'skateboard' (base electrical mainframe with a vehicle's four wheels) and 'top hat' system (different model builds, the 'type' of car, gets attached to the skateboard) that enables concurrent production lines. They can pump them out, and they have a deal with Hyundai to use Hyundai's production infrastructure. Production speed is already outpacing competition just in prototypes. The leadership is ex-BMW and -VW Audi designers/engineers.

You can check out the vehicle design here [https://www.canoo.com/design/](https://www.canoo.com/design/) and the real gold here [https://investors.canoo.com](https://investors.canoo.com), the investor presentation is unreal. They have a great product and plan to bring to market. Where they're really changing the game is the subscription model - ""transportation as service"" - which includes the vehicle, insurance, customizability (factory printed and applied, artist-designed skins). You should check it out for yourself and see if you like the vision. Regardless, price is going up. This is a company that can easily go to $50, surpass a NIO, and hit $100+ on Tesla's back. Average volume in November was under 500k and now we're seeing 7+ mil. They presented at Credit Suisse last week and this week they'll reveal the B2B product. Next week the ticker changes and then it's really over. Long calls and shares on dips. Hopefully you caught the holiday sale yesterday. If not, watch carefully.

Bull Case for LAZR - Next Potential TSLA,0.73,"Brought to you by the retard who made $3 million by YOLOing into NVAX (peep the profile), here is my next play. I recently liquidated the majority of my NVAX shares and dumped the majority of that money into LAZR.

For those who don't know LAZR is a Peter Thiel backed company specializing in LiDAR technology for vehicles, that just underwent a SPAC merger. This caused the stock to skyrocket 300% within three weeks. The stock is still up 150% just this month even following this past week of consolidation and bad news.

The main reason that the stock was falling this past week, aside from consolidation was due to a hit piece by Shitron (Citron). If you are part of this community you know that Citron is utter market manipulating dogshit. It started to recover yesterday, until news came that Mobileye (an Intel subsidiary) would be producing its own in-house LiDAR technology. This caused the stock to fall another 20%.

However, this was a complete market overreaction. The main reason for recovery today is that LAZR was given a price target of $41 by Northland's Gus Richard (a 5 star analyst, much more competent than the retards at Citron), as well as an upgrade from Market Preform (Hold) to Outperform (Buy). 

https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/gus-richard

If every thing goes as planned, Mobileye will not have produced in house sensors by 2025. He stated that he doubts Intel would be able to successfully produce this in time.  Given Intel's terrible year, there should not be much confidence behind them.

LAZR still has several contracts with companies such as Volkswagen, Volvo and Daimler, and even NIO in China, with products releasing throughout 2021 and 2022. As time goes on, only more contracts will be acquired.

If you are bullish on any of the Chinese electric vehicle stocks, you should be bullish on LiDAR as well as they are using this technology in their car. Even Elon Musk is afraid of this technology. The fact that he is denouncing this technology clearly indicates to me that it is a threat to him.

Why LAZR over VLDR?

VLDR is the industry leader. However, it is clear that LAZR's sensors are much more powerful and cheaper to produce. The CEO literally invented a brand new microchip because the current ones in the market weren't good enough. Speaking of the CEO, he is a big dick 25 year old youngest new billionaire in the world. He was given 100,000 by Thiel to drop out of Stanford and pursue LAZR. VLDR uses a LiDAR unit that stacks 64 lasers in a vertical column and spins the whole thing around many times per second. This is incredibly expensive to produce. LAZR instead uses a single mirror to focus and guide its lazer, making it significantly cheaper.

TLDR: Buy LAZR. Backed by Peter Thiel, just this morning given a price target of $41.",2020-12-16 18:55:20

How bullish 0% interest rate world really is - Answer: VERY BULLISH,0.92,"Good evening legends,

The following post will be brief. This post will setup my framework and over the next few days I'm going to be posting my DDs on the stocks I've invested in if there is interest.

# TLDR: I am FULLY SENDING IT - below is WHY.

**Aphorism 1:** ""STONKS only go up"" - WSB legends

* I am a true believer of things improving over time. My plays are stocks and leaps due to tax advantages and frankly the humility that came along with trying to time the top/bottom and failing on multiple occasions.

**Aphorism 2:** ""History doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes."" - Mark Twain

* What are the top 3 countries with the lowest interest rates?
   * Switzerland: maintained the same interest rate for the last five years. Annualized return of EWL ETF over those 5 years? 10% with 61% total return.
   * Denmark: maintained 0% to negative \~1% interest rate for the last five years. Annualized return of EDEN ETF over those 5 years? 12.78% with 82.43% total return.
   * Japan: has been fucked for a long time, everybody knows it. EVENTHOUGH FUCKED - annualized return of EWJ over the past 5 years? 8.22% with 48.46% total return.
* The Federal Reserve indicates it will not raise rates for years. It will leave the interest rates around 0% until 2023. What does this mean? Long equity, any equity and if you want to short something don't short fucking TESLA short BANKS.

PLTR - Technical Analysis from a Professional Investor - Update 12/15,0.93,"So I did an update a week ago telling you why PLTR at 25 was likely the bottom. I also told you to get the hell out of the 12/11-12/18 options as those would expire worthless.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k98p6h/pltr\_technical\_analysis\_from\_a\_professional/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k98p6h/pltr_technical_analysis_from_a_professional/)

now I will go over how to trade the stock in the next couple of weeks. I am cutting down the number of words I am writing because it has come to my attention from comments in my previous posts that a lot of you guys can't read. So I am going to keep it even more basic.

We are now approaching where TSLA and NIO were after their first initial rally, correction and consolidation before the second leg rally which then forms the symmetrical triangle.

https://preview.redd.it/yzim1gl5ke561.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e35a306b95241794ff00e6c69b14e6285bae886

Again, this was the same chart for Tesla for the first phase of the run-up and transition to the second run-up. The slight skew of the triangle doesn't matter, what matters is you see a narrowing of the band before the upward movement.

Now we look at option pricing. Option deltas  are the most attractive that I have seen on PLTR for almost 1+ month now. These tell me that there are very few buyers of call options at this point and we are in a lull before periods of significant more option buying.

&#x200B;

We are about to start the explosive second run phase of Palantir and my target still mid to low 40s by end of the year/early next year.  Again, don't be surprised if we still dip down to around 23. But the downside is largely done. This is of course assuming we don't get a massive stock market crash for which I have small amounts of hedges on VIX calls that are rolling on a monthly basis.

https://preview.redd.it/1orczd5xje561.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef76cf4df7324f0779a1949f980dd78d29f2f150

TLR: go long PLTR now, risk reward is quite favorable. 23 is the lowest it can probably go in the short term. You are already seeing doubters on PLTR on WSB. This means from a psychological stand-point, most would be sellers are already gone. The market is now open widely to incremental buyers. I bought some 12/24 calls at the 30 strike and added more to my 5/21 50 strike.

Take this DD from your neighborhood genius asian man and friend of WSB. 

China's Domestic Issues:  
\-Car ownership is rising in the millions as the middle class income is rising along with its soaring population. So is China's air pollution problem--a huge issue and international embarrassment.   
\-China is the world's 4th largest oil producer, behind the United States. This is not enough oil for China's voracious demand, so they must import tons of barrels from OPEC nations. Of course, they don't want to rely on them. Who does? Will they go to war with them like the US has done in the past twenty years? NO! Because the Chinese want to rely on a more tech-driven solution. 

EV's. Nio is an answer to many of China's problems. With battery swap technology making battery charging more affordable and faster for the driver, Nio's EV ecosystem will net billions of dollars from China alone. EV's used to be for the rich. NIO will increasingly make cars affordable for the middle class. Also, imagine if GE or Toyota made money off ""fuel"" in addition to selling their cars. That's what NIO will do with their subscription-based charging stations. 

International Upside:  
\-Why do you think China accepted Tesla into their country and not other businesses like Amazon, Google, or Facebook? Well, they say there's no free lunch. China wants to sell their cars to the United States. China also wants to set up EV charging stations throughout the US as Tesla will do in China--this is the next gas station business. Imagine Standard Oil level income for NIO!!!   
\-If the US doesn't agree with Nio, then China will say, ""bye bye Tesla"".   
\-Europe is a lock. NIO has offices in UK and Germany. Like it or not, Europe is swayed by China's money in a way that the US is still not. 

Comparables:  
\-If you wanna see how China will do in the future, look no further than Japan and South Korea. Very similar in every respect. Japan thrived after it transitioned from an agrarian economy to a manufacturing one, of cheap electronics and cars. Then it transitioned into making quality products, right after they hosted the summer Olympics, like Sony, Toshiba, Toyota, etc. It was made possible due to the Japanese people's industriousness, denial of self, national pride, and quite frankly, Asian smarts.   
\-Similar thing happened in South Korea--transitioned from making rice to making cheap manufacturing of electronics and cars. Like Japan, they're now in the process of making quality products--the surge also happening after around the time they hosted the Summer Olympics in '88. Think Samsung's phones. Think higher-end Sonatas, or LG flat screen TV's.   
\-China? China has been a manufacturing powerhouse since the 2000s. But millennial sand boomers should remember all the cheap ""Made in China"" jokes. This image is slowly fading as China now has Huawei, Alibaba, Tencent making new innovations in AI and commerce. This again, happened after what? The 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.  
\-So where the hell are the Chinese cars? Where is China's Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, or Kia? 

NIO!!!! Unlike Toyota, Hyundai, etc. China's manufacturers can scale to levels no other country in the world has ever done in the past.

Nio will outgrow Tesla even if it doesn't make it to the United States. But Trump is no longer in office, and I doubt Biden will be capable of doing anything meaningful to stop Nio's rise. 

CEO Upside:  
\-William Li has a perfect track record. He took a failing Auto-Review company, invested in it with his own money and became its CEO. Within years, he IPO'd it on the NYSE, making himself and fellow investors billions of dollars.   
\-Forget Jack Ma, William is often called the Steve Jobs of China. That Elon Musk Battery Day flop? It will never happen with NIO. William has an immense eye for detail. He's a showman with the most anal high standards. In 2018, he got one of the Nio cars to talk about Bruno Mars and then had Bruno Mars frickin' show up on live stream to give a talk.

Nio is a steal in the $40 range. For you impatient ones, there'll be a catalyst in Nio Day coming up on Jan 9. But if you can buy leaps or hold shares long term, this will surpass 100 bucks for sure.

Weekly Update: What if you sold the most popular contracts on reddit expiring December 18th,0.87,"I have been analyzing comments and posts on reddit to determine what stocks are mentioned the most. This week I am looking at the options contracts that have been mentioned on the subreddits we track.  Specifically, I am looking at contracts expiring this Friday 12/18.    The data collected for this analysis was collected from 12/04 ‚Äì 12/10.  For Friday‚Äôs expiration there are 448 contracts and 714 mentions of these contracts.  Quite an increase from last week which is pretty exciting.  Though, I mostly attribute this to improvements in the machine learning models we are using to identify stocks and contracts.  The most popular contracts this week are the PLTR 30 Call and the LAZR 30 Put.  

The goal here is to track what reddit is following and to see how reddit preforms.  There is this notion that retail investors often fail to beat the market. This is why financial advisors recommend that you buy into the major ETF‚Äôs such as SPY.  As historically there have been few people that manage to beat the major Index‚Äôs year over year.  My hypothesis going into this week is that I should bet against the trends on reddit as typically the retail investor is wrong.  

As of week 1, I would have profited $1710 betting against reddit [Last Weeks Recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditTickers/comments/kbcc6x/weekly_results_what_if_you_sold_the_most_popular/).  I will continue to track my progress each week. 

I just want to emphasize it does not matter if I am right or wrong.  More importantly this research is to identify if there are any trends worth following. 

Call Data

* Out of the 448 contracts 356 are calls (80% Long)  
* 70.8% of the calls are out of the money
* The out of the money Calls are an average of 23% out of the money. 
* The in the money calls are an average of 26% in the money. 

Put Data

* Out of 448 Contracts 92 are puts
* 67.4% of the puts are out of the money
* The out of the money puts are an average of 18.7% out of the money
* The in the money puts are an average of 22% in the money 

On both the call and put sides the out of the money contracts are an average of 20%+ out of the money.  I am not that surprised as there is a lot of yolo culture on reddit.  It is surprising to see the number of contracts that are out of the money in general.  Out of the 448 contracts only 134 are in the money as of last Friday‚Äôs close. 

The most popular calls that are in the money are: 

* PLTR 20, 22, 26 
* TSLA 600 
 

The most popular puts that are in the money are: 

* LAZR 30
* CRSR 35.  

The most popular calls that are out of the money are 

* PLTR 30, 32, 35 
* TSLA 630, 650, 700
* ARKG 100
* NIO 50 
* SPY 380

The most popular puts that are out of the money are:

* LAZR 25, 20
* SPY 350
* PLTR 25, 26
* SNOW 330

My hypothesis is that the majority of these contracts will be losers.  Based on the data I would be looking to sell the PLTR 32 and TSLA 630 calls and LAZR 20 / 25 Puts. I will update with the premium prices first thing tomorrow morning at market open.",2020-12-14 01:31:32
What is the average time you hold positions?,0.89,"I started trading around 2 months ago and its been an insane rollercoaster.

What do all these have in common? Batteries. Now how are batteries made? Well I don‚Äôt fucking know. 


BUT I know that you need rare-earth metals to create them for example: Neodymium.


Now let me tell you that China controls 80% of that supply. And as you know, things are very heated between the west and China. This means that potentially the supply can be cut off or China will increase the prices.


Even elon musk our daddy cant fight this. So we have to help him like the retards we are. 


Thats why this company called MP Materials will save us. They have currently a market cap of 4B. Now imagine when sleepy Joe tries to strengthen USA in the clean energy and EV industry. This thing will fly. Maybe 3-5x their current market cap in the next 4 years. Why would you miss out on that?

‚ÄòTwas the Night Before Witchmas,0.93,"‚ÄòTwas the night before Witchmas and all through the sub
Not an autist was stirring, no üåàüêª hubbub
The short dated calls were bought up with care
In hopes that St. Jerome soon would be there

The bulls were nestled all snug in their beds
While visions of lambos danced in their heads
And Tim Apple in his kerchief and Bezos in his cap
Had just settled down for a long winter's nap

When out on Wall Street there arose such a clatter
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter
Away to the trading app I flew like a flash
Dumped all my money into ABNB and DASH

To the moon on the breast of the new-fallen SNOW
Gave the lustre of mid-day to all IPOs
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear
But a miniature fund of eight stonks I hold dear

With a little old driver, who calls the Fed ‚Äúhome‚Äù
I knew in a moment it must be St. Jerome
More rapid than eagles his printing it came
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:

‚ÄúNow, TSLA! now, SPCE! now, TQQQ and PLTR!
On, MU! on SPACs! on, NIO and SQ!
To the top of the charts! till you‚Äôre the talk of the Wall!
Now üåï away! Moon away! Moon away all!""

As WSB memes that before they inevitably die
When they meet with any news, üöÄ to the sky
So up to the top-movers the stonks they flew
With the sleigh full of tendies, and St. Jerome too

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the news
Rates would never be higher, till at least ‚Äò22
As I drew in some crayons, account turning around
Down the chimney St. Jerome came with a bound

He was dressed all in Herm√®s, from his head to his foot
It was apparent the man had never purchased a put
The entire global markets he had flung on his back
And he looked like he could out-print any attack

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work
And filled all the accounts; then turned with a smirk
And laying his finger aside of his nose
And giving a nod, up the elevator stocks rose

He sprang to his printer, to his team gave a whistle
And out money flew like it was shot from a missile
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,
HAPPY WITCHMAS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOOD-NIGHT!

Introducing WSB Roulette! Randomly generated options plays because this is a casino!,0.98,"**Intro**

I'd like to present my latest waste of time, WSB Roulette! Since logic no longer applies with trading in 2020, why not let RNGesus help? This is a quick python script I put together that takes a list of tickers and generates some random options to help you lose your money without guilt. If you lose money with these trades, you can blame RNG instead of yourself! If you're feeling even more adventurous, there's an FD mode too!

**DISCLAIMER**

This script is purely for entertainment purposes and I will be not responsible for any losses your retarded plays get you!!


**How it works**  
More details available in the README in the Github repo, but here's the gist of it. You feed it a list of tickers you want to ""invest"" in. For each one, it randomly decides whether to make a call/put, selects a random expiration date and strike price and returns the relevant data. The script uses a library that uses the Yahoo Finance API for data which is limited to 1000 API calls per hour per IP address.

Activating FD mode restricts the returned options to those that are <2 weeks and 3-5 strikes OTM only. Otherwise by default, you have a chance of OTM, ATM, and ITM  options.

**Setup and Usage**  
You'll need Python 3.6+ installed. Download requirements.txt and wsbroulette.py from the Github repo. Open a command prompt, navigate to the directory you downloaded the files and install the requirements using

    pip install -r requirements.txt    

Script Usage:

    python wsbroulette.py -t TICKERS -b BALANCE [-e EXPIRATION RANGE] [-s STRIKE_RANGE] [-d DISTRIBUTION] [-f] [-beargang] [-bullgang]

Enter the list of tickers in parantheses and seperated by commas. Ex. ""TSLA,GME,ROPE""

Balance is the maximum amount of $ you want to spend

EXPIRATION_RANGE is optional and controls what the maximum number of expiration dates are returned (Default = 4)

STRIKE_RANGE is optional and controls the range of strikes returned from the current underlying price (Default = 3)

DISTRIBUTION is optional and controls the randomness of allocation of funds between the tickers (Lower is more random, Higher is more even, Default = 10)

Add the -f flag if you want to engage FD mode! In FD mode, only the next 2 expiration dates are used. Options are also always OTM at 3-5 strikes out from underlying.

Add either the -beargang or -bullgang flag if you want to only generate puts or calls, respectively



**Example Usage**

    python wsbroulette.py -t ""TSLA,PLTR,GME,NIO"" -b 50000 -e 2 -s 5

This generates 4 options for TSLA, PLTR, GME, NIO with a total bankroll of up to $50,000. It will only use up to the next 2 expirations because FDs are life. The strike price will be in the range of +/- 5 strikes from the current underyling price.

    python wsbroulette.py -t ""TSLA,PLTR,GME,NIO"" -b 50000 -f

FD MODE! Generate 4 options for TSLA, PLTR, GME, NIO with a bankroll of $50k. Options are OTM, expire within 2 weeks and are 3-5 strikes out.

NIO,0.89,"We saw NIO hit an all time high in the high 58s before coming crashing down to close at $41 today. What happened?

üåà üêª Andrew Left of Citron broke momentum by posting a price target of $25 for NIO. This was the first big event that caused NIO to plummet, although it did rebound, but many retail and boomer investors were scared off.

Then the House passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. This bill delists foreign stocks that don‚Äôt uphold the standard American GAAP American accounting standard. This brought Chinese stocks and NIO under $50 for the first time in weeks. This is super irrational as NIO has been compliant ever since the Senate passed this bill months ago (they even use the same auditer that Tesla uses).

At this point, NIO is being way undervalued and the selloffs were caused by really irrational things and NIO should be a buy already.

All looked well and NIO was consolidating at $45-$47 before two days ago. Then NIO announced a $2B stock issuing (which only diluted shares by 5%) and everyone freaked out and paper handed till NIO sits at the $41 it is sitting at right now.

Well what will this $2B be used for. Rumor has it that NIO will be using it to expand in foreign markets soon and building infrastructure in Europe, etc. üò≥ if this turns out to be true this could be a huge catalyst for another NIO rally.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/cntechpost.com/2020/12/12/nio-is-closer-to-entering-overseas-markets/amp/

Other potential causes for a major NIO rally include NIO Day on 1/4 (think of Tesla Battery Day but chinese) üöÄ
And the fact that NIO is showing a pennant forming right now. Don‚Äôt want to link an Imgur, but trust me. It sold off a couple times and is consolidating rn, prime for a breakout. Breakout could happen by end of next week according to my calculations.

NIO is at a deep discount right now, levels we haven‚Äôt seen since early November so be prepared for a major moon soon

NIO Present&Future,0.69,"Since there are lot of posts about nio i decided to put my 5 cents opinion, cause here it is either buy weekly 5P or 80C

I am in for almost a year when it was pretty unpopular stock without hype and i did not sell a shit even at ATH or now nor i plan to. Nio maybe mooned on EV hype and shit but fundamentals do not lie. Maybe they do not sell hundred thousands vehicles a year (yet) but they sit on technologies that are far more advanced that any other ev company has done. Battery swaps net that assure you can drive half a china without needed to stop for several hours recharge is so huge and imo it is still not fully priced in. Their expansion to europe is coming and if they are able to build samelike battery swaps stations net in europe its something even unbelievable huge to describe.

What we hate at evs the most and propably why many people still not buy them are that after few hundred miles you gotta waste several hours standing on some shitass gas station recharging battery. So the answer is solid state battery or battery swap stations.

Mark cap now: 50B 

Mark cap if the expansion to europe,compliance with US and improved margin numbers: 500B is not crazy to think of




(Because i was accused of being just bullish)
If they do not comply with US audit, they numbers will be proven to be fake, they will not expand to europe or some other terrible news - it goes to 0$ faster than your wife's boyfriend's balance after you started trading.

"NIO DD, bear time?",0.53,"So you know it and I know it too, this market in general is absolutely absurd and crazy, some people call it a bubble, other people call it priced in, and other people call it free tendies. Right now here is a daily chart of spy

https://preview.redd.it/n19jyt9w8m461.png?width=847&format=png&auto=webp&s=177496ec05c3156a645730d701ef8150ede13916

For the past couple weeks we have been slowly inching higher and higher, but sentiment in the overal market is that we are all greedy and stuff, we are in a bubble yatta yatta gay bears prophesizing the crash that will never come. However, loooking at the 20 SMA(green line) there has been a historical record of price of the spy going down after it touches the green line. This dosent happen all the time like you can see in august and may but 4 out of the 6 times that this has happened spy went on to go down for a few days after touching the green line. Right now we are about to touch that green line, and so far we have been red for a bout 3 days(writing this as of 3 pm on friday idk if we close green now). This leads me to be a little bearish on the overall market. 

&#x200B;

Now for NIO, this stock had a historic run where it constantly kept going up 10 percent every day and was free tendies with the hype of Electrical Vehicles, TSLA was also pumping and stonks only went up. Then PLTR came along and people ditched NIO the chinese EV company and PLTR went on to go massive up same as NIO, and NIO became less and less cool. Memes where spread, and not as many people where hype for NIO and went on to go full retard on PLTR cause tits literally couldn't go up. 

To get a clearer picture of NIO lets take a look at this intresting chart

&#x200B;

[Daily chart from a YouTube video ZipTrader\(not current chart, price rn is around 41.80\)](https://preview.redd.it/1v3zwwhgam461.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=db510d3a5c9b106997376b9d07cc55f03a79c02b)

SO we can see that according to this chart made from some random dude named ZipTrader, NIO price is mostly priced in by hype on NIO itself and EV hype. However you know it and I know it too, EV hype is dying, TSLA is going down, overall market is going down, and NIO hype is also going down. They arent many hot posts on this sub reddit anymore about NIO or pltr cause people tis are currently about to go up. Only hot post I could find was  this one, which will go into my main point.  

[Tesla chart comparable to NIO](https://preview.redd.it/egsp0z4ibm461.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=9798f3876039a15990d73aad4e61bb9408657c5f)

So with this TSLA chart, on the point that u/sncsoccer pointed out, TSLA went down pretty hard before recovering afterwards. Now why did TSLA Go down in this point and time? My theory was that it was due to a head and shoulders pattern. Looking at the chart he posted, it looks pretty similar to one, but not exactly a head and shoulders. 

[Daily chart of TSLA near early 2020](https://preview.redd.it/43mk7kvbcm461.png?width=857&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe8437e8e704a970e6e594c1102115035dd732e9)

Looking at a better chart here, you can vaguely draw a head and shoulders, and here it worked but tbh this didnt really look too much like a head and shoulders with that left shoulder being so high, but never the less it worked in the scenario. But the real head and shoulders is on NIO. lets take a look at NIO

[NIO daily chart ](https://preview.redd.it/ieyhqj7mcm461.png?width=871&format=png&auto=webp&s=32823eb77a091c55ba17ee062621b248723d5480)

Here is on this NIO chart is almost a perfect example of a head and shoulders, go look on your own at the chart and it will be clear as day. The shoulders, the head, the neck line, everything about it is perfect. Now for those of you who don't know what a head and shoulders are, its basically a bearish indicator where tits will go up and gay bears profit. Now that docent mean NIO has to go down or will go down 100 percent, but its a dam good bet after considering the spy chart, the tsla chart, the loss of hype on EV and NIO, and the bubble that we are in. I am predicting that NIO will go down to at least 40 dollars by the end of next week.

[Yahoo finance says NIO is bearish and detects bearish patterns](https://preview.redd.it/xfofacvqdm461.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=2971aec9f9e3456efe335f5efd3260d24e83cdb7)

Even yahoo finance says that this stock is bearish and has said it detected a bearish pattern. This on its own isnt much but when you combine it with everything else I have said maybe it starts to make sense. Also you can see the head and shoulders on NIO clearer here. 

That being said, all of you diamond hand NIO people could still be fine even after this massive drill that I think is going to happen cause just like tsla, NIO will likely recover. However, if you have weekly calls or anything close that, you may be fucked so if I were you id get out while you still could(nothing in this post is financial advise pls don't sue).  

&#x200B;

THE PLAY: NIO puts. I recommend getting something close to the money like the 40.5 put or the 40 put with about 3 weeks of time or more, but these can be a bit over priced right now since the stock is already down about 8 percent. If you are a bit more balsy and going WSB full YOLO mode then you could put money into the 39.5 put or even lower with even less time on the put, however, I recommend taking profits on this type of put very early since I think while it does have a good chance to go lower than 40 dollars, there isn't a guarantee that it will and also in that amount of time. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR; Puts on NIO, 40 strike 3 weeks of time or more, 39.5 strike put with less time if your feeling balsy. Tits can go up with NIO cause of the head and shoulders pattern on it and overall market is going down, EV Hype is dead, NIO hype is dead, Bubble burst happening soon, GAY bear time

"CCJ (Uranium), the last cheap green energy",0.9,"TLDR: CCJ $15c March 2021

Call me an autist, but while doing some value stock DD over the weekend, instead of typing in CCL, I typed in CCJ. Turns out there's something good to uncover.

CCJ (Cameco) is one of the larger uranium players currently listed in the US (that means RH-tradeable), and has quite a cheap option chain. Looking at the $15c March 2021, the IV is only \~50% which is much cheaper than NIO, FCEL or whatever the current meme stocks are. [It is also the second largest uranium producers accounting for 18% of the world's annual production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameco).

I may be late one day already, but all the Uranium names had a fantastic day Friday, rising anywhere from 10% to 17%. Is this a start of a meme-able stock? Well, nothing has stopped [r/wsb](https://www.reddit.com/r/wsb/) from piling onto the bandwagon, be it [war](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eld4i6/all_in_the_war_machine/) or [disability](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9sx9d/congrats_autists_the_cover_of_bloomberg/). Plus, the float for all the uranium names are all very small (hence enhanced W E A P O N I Z E D A U T I S M contravening rule #1 possibly).

So why Uranium? Number one is energy. Get your retarded heads out of your prolapsing anus. War demand for uranium is infinitesimal compared to energy. Nuclear energy is very cheap, according to the [EIA's 2019 Energy Outlook](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/). Yes wind, natural gas etc are cheaper, but the Green New Deal should float all boats. There is a viable demand for uranium for energy use during the next decade, especially as the world tries to move towards electrification.

(Not the cheapest, but still cheap)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/66xcwwvg9l461.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=9800575d2f4688995df3191f0fd45de7c09ca987

&#x200B;

 

Fine, so what about war? Well, that's the reason why uranium stocks popped on Friday. On Friday, House and Senate lawmakers revealed a compromise version of the annual National Defense Authorization Act. According to S&P Global, the bill effectively provides for the military to continue a policy under President-elect Joe Biden that classifies the domestic supplies of certain minerals such as uranium, graphite and lithium as vital to national security. You know what happens to companies which are deemed to have things critical to national security (BA, LMT, APT during March), they get bid up. Suddenly valuations jump, and all those underlying ores get a massive premium, because the government is backing up the price (kinda like the S&P and the fed put in a way).

Honestly, it's all about the meme capability. Dude, who doesn't want to own uranium? I heard you can make boom boom with it or something. Couple that with a 10% jump/day, historical lows for the actual uranium price, low IVs and low exploitable market caps and floats, your wife will drop her panties and run back to you once you announce you own a part of a uranium mine.

(Uranium futures prices back to 2008. 2008 high at $100, currently at $29.55)

Well, how about marking basically the bottom and getting in while the roller coaster is ascending? What if all those retard EV money starts going towards uranium?",2020-12-11 16:58:55
The Fallen Berry will be reincarnated as a $BB Rocket going to the moon!üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ,0.96,"Hello Retard!! 

Have you heard of the fallen Berry in the Fruit wars of the touch phones? 

NO?? Good I didn't expect you to know anything you retarded fuck!! and don't research it too or I'll call your wife's boyfriend to beat your ass!

Anyway... BlackBerry has reinvented itself as an IT company in 2014 after John Chen became CEO. It now leads in the cybersecurity industry with contracts signed with 18 out of the 20 G20 countries. From the Airforce to Fortune 500 companies Blackberry handles their cybersecurity needs.

I can go on and on about how good they are in the cybersecurity space but WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT SHIT! What we care about is the EV(EV stands for electrical vehicle you retard) industry which **WE** Blasted into Saturn this year.

The BlackBerry QNX software is in 175 million vehicles. In addition, BlackBerry just announced that it partnered with **Amazon** to create BlackBerry IVY which is a software which will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights  from that data that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles. **Blah Blah Blah,** why would I care? Because every car company and especially EV companies were looking for a service like this which BlackBerry and Amazon **will literally pioneer.** In addition, the CEO mentioned in an interview the possibility of partnering up with our EV company **$TSLA.** Now imagine how news of this would affect $BB.

&#x200B;

Now your small brain might wonder with all of BlackBerry's potential, why isn't it moving much in price???!!! 

In my opinion, It's because boomers are still butt hurt about the steep price drop of it after the fruit wars and that it never recovered. This company literally has a price to book value of 2.3. Which means it's very undervalued!! and it has **CASH** for days... so no worries about offerings.

**Now for the important part how could it rise to what it's actually worth??** 

We retards can adopt this $BB and raise it to be the next bloated(100$+) EV play in the industry. Why raise foreign fat Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..) when we can literally raise a malnourished North American $BB. 

$BB needs more exposure and we can start by making some High quality memes for it...

So what's the nextt Tesla-Style stock?,0.41,"From Feburary Tesla went up and analysts on both sides were wrong on if it will crash or when it would rise, it climbed up to over $1000 then dropped back down to $00 range on manipulated news, than in one week basically made all that up, exceeding $1000, and then did a stock split where it's climbed back to the 600's where it is currently..

While Tesla is still viable, for the average working man it's ***too expensive***, stocks over $150 will always be outside the working mans budget, but semi-far out the money options being $1000-$10,000 per ONE contract has also removed the budget mans ability to buy options. (unless they do spreads but that defeats the purpose.)

This is of course unless some idiot wants to pay .80 contract for the zero chance that Tesla gets to 950 in one week. The people who handled things correctly during Teslas months of run up have made hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars.

**So what's the NEXT Tesla, that will run up short-term AND long-term and** ***isn't a fad or obvious retail trap (like Nio, PLTR, etc.*****) that will grow to be another hundred thousand to million dollar maker within the next handful of months?**

Disney STOCK NEWS | DoorDash & AirBnB Price Target | STOCK EARNNINGS & MARKET NEWS [12-11],0.86,"**Disney lays out the plans for the future, the FDA advisory panel gives their OK. What‚Äôs my price target and should you buy DoorDash and AirBnB? Let‚Äôs talk about this and everything about the stock market**

Hey everyone and Good morning! So let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we only saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/1RgJRtS) gaining some ground, up more than half a % while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/vQY7s6C) finished .13% down and the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/BcgtnC2) fell just below 30k, losing .23% for the day. All 3 indexes traded way lower in the beginning of the day after the jobless claims came in, but recovered once the FDA Advisory panel meeting started. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/SwcQnHs) finish higher for the day after it opened at over 23 to start us off.

Almost 60% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/qdWy3jk), but the volume was way below average for most of them, with the Energy sector being the only significant gainer, up 3% for the day while most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/5xskzgj) were flat or even lost ground for the day. On a factor [basis](https://ibb.co/Z28KH04), only large-cap value companies from the industrial sector suffered big yesterday, as small cap growth companies outperformed.

You can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y0jvPBX), that big caps, with the exception of Apple and Tesla did struggle yesterday, while most of the companies with big gains were from the oil & gas industry, with Chevron gaining more than 3% for the day, while Exxon, Total and BP also had big gains.

The numbers that came in [yesterday](https://ibb.co/MPxZS56) on the economic front where mixed. As initial and continuing jobless claims came in [worse](https://ibb.co/NmgdXbJ) than expected, as more than 850K people filed for initial claims up more than 125K since the last week and what the analysts [expected](https://ibb.co/KrGcRk7), as this was the biggest spike in initial claims since march, while the continuing claims also rose for the first time since September. I am wondering, will [this](https://ibb.co/0X6FCH5) finally push the congress to act on a relief bill? I think the economy really needs it as a bridge to better times. Just look at the [EU](https://ibb.co/ncSgyWd), they have finally agreed on $2.2T budget and stimulus package to help the Eurozone get through the difficult times.

Better numbers came in from the consumer price [index](https://ibb.co/NjLW663), as the index rose by .2%, after it was unchanged in October, but this should be taken with a grain of salt, as most of consumer confidence increase comes from the high-income [consumers](https://ibb.co/DVJ5nK9), while people who have an income under $50K still struggling.

Also, the Federal [Budget](https://ibb.co/8BFdyZ7) came in better than expected as the deficit shrank more in November compared to October and compared to last year‚Äôs month.

[Today](https://ibb.co/pP78rTs) is a slow day in terms of economic data, but we do get a final read on the Producer price index and the consumer sentiment index.

We also finally got the [FDA](https://ibb.co/9gLsrh6) panel of outside experts meeting yesterday, which saw the panel vote 17 FOR, 4 against and one abstain. The only small concerns were on the topic of 16 and 17-year old‚Äôs as some experts argued that there is insufficient data on that subgroup, but I don‚Äôt think that is a case for concern, as the vaccine is likely going to take a while until young people will start to get the shot, as they are one of the least impacted groups. This is great news, as the FDA does usually follow up this committee advice, so we can see the FDA Emergency use authorization very very soon. Vaccine doses are already ready go within 24hours of the authorization so, things will start to move rather fast after that.

So, we got some earnings numbers yesterday from a lot of companies, let‚Äôs talk about them a little.

[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/C040BWf) posted a beat on the top and bottom line with e-commerce sales rising by more than 80%, while [comparable](https://ibb.co/YQQknbj) sales in stores were more than 17%. With both EPS and revenue beating the estimates, I think this might be the time to get into COSTCO, as they are one of the best retailers in the world, they always trade at a premium, the [stock](https://ibb.co/QnQNJGJ) is just about 5% from the all-time high and is far from overbought territory. I really like them as they have also rewarded shareholders constantly both with great growth and dividends.

[Broadcom](https://ibb.co/St74KMD) also posted a great beat on EPS and an 11% increase in revenues, fueled by a great beat in the semiconductor segment, while also posting a free cash flow of over $3B, way better than expected, as they also increased the quarterly dividend by 11% and have made a lot of [senior](https://ibb.co/hcMS6Vs) leadership changes yesterday, but the [stock](https://ibb.co/TB97nhZ) is down more than 2% in pre-market trading despite a lot of great numbers.

The company has most of its [revenues](https://ibb.co/bLbzgKL) coming from semiconductor solutions, this is very good as the [global](https://ibb.co/GfZGfnz) semiconductor sales have increased more than 5% in FY2020 and are expected to increase more than 8% for FY 2021, way better than the previous [outlook](https://ibb.co/MSrLh0p) of 6,2%.

The company also posted all time [highs](https://ibb.co/1vM8WP0) in net revenue, free cash flows, gross margin and adjusted EBITDA, while the compound annual [growth](https://ibb.co/zRW1jLZ) of the dividend since FY2016 is almost 50%. I think I might be investing even more in this company especially if they have a pullback.

Next let‚Äôs go to Lululemon who also [posted](https://ibb.co/qF1NnnN) a beat on EPS and Revenues, while comparable sales were up 19% with better gross and operating margins than expected. This was led by a huge [rise](https://ibb.co/zfKRJX5) in the international markets which will continue to expand as they gain more recognition overseas.

A smaller company that [reported](https://ibb.co/2WMrybz) yesterday was Dave & Buster‚Äôs as the losses were smaller than expected as comparable store sales declined by 66% as the restrictions in the restaurant industry keeps hammering away. The stock was trading +4% in after hours as investors may have though of an even worse result.

Moving on, [Adobe](https://ibb.co/Vjwwprm) also released earnings before the market opened yesterday, after a delayed earnings release. They posted a great beat on EPS and the revenues while also giving great guidance for next year, way above the consensus, with more than $15B in revenues and a EPS of over $11. The company also announced a new $15B share buyback [program](https://ibb.co/cKBbMpF) which will increase the value of the stock through the next 4 years while also have a strong [growth](https://ibb.co/G7BySxH) path, and despite all of this the stock [lost](https://ibb.co/Bnkk60T) more than 1,4% for the day.

The other earnings report that was released yesterday was from [Oracle](https://ibb.co/KsSGZNW), they also posted a great beat on the top and bottom line, but didn‚Äôt offer any guidance as that kind of disappointed investors and dipped about 1% in after hours. I don‚Äôt really have a great grasp of the company‚Äôs growth potential is right now.

We also got the Disney Investors meeting, in which the company share a lot of new great things. First of all, [Disney+](https://ibb.co/kJRc01G) has gone up another 18% since just 4 weeks ago, and is up to more than 86M subscribers, with the total number for the company‚Äôs streaming services surpassing 137M as they plan to expand Disney+ in Eastern Europe, South Korea, Hong Kong and other markets next year.

The company also [expects](https://ibb.co/4skfTC8) to have more than 230M subscribers by 2024, a very big increase from the prior estimate, while they are also planning on raising the monthly fee starting in March.

They plan to [release](https://ibb.co/F0G0C84) a lot of new content directly to Disney+, which is another big hit to the cinema world. With the Marvel and Star Wars series being big blockbusters for the movie industry.

They presented so much new [content](https://ibb.co/8jpZtWN) for the company, that it took them more than 2 hours to talk about all of this.

But they also [said](https://ibb.co/DWwJ1tg) that these decisions are temporary, and that they still prefer theatrical releases especially for blockbusters, so, there is still some hope for cinema‚Äôs, but maybe not just right now, it will take years to recover from this, and they will probably have to largely reduce the number of screens so that they may become profitable again.

So, over 100 new content releases per year is a lot for the [company](https://ibb.co/fFD4vhs), this was a very good investors meeting that pleased investors, as the company is [trading](https://ibb.co/Y86n6HD) \+7,5% in pre-market.

Disney is my second biggest position in my portfolio and I am really happy with what the company presented today. I think this stock may get to 200$ easily when the parks and entertainment business goes back online, as that accounted for 1/3 of the revenues before this year.

In other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/NL6sXcT), NIO will offer 60M shares, with an additional 9M shares option for underwriters. The stock fell sharply after the news, dropping more than 6% in After-hours [trading](https://ibb.co/85PycWh).

Also, Qualcomm suffered after the close yesterday, as the shares fell more than 5% after [news](https://ibb.co/5h4syVT) popped that Apple is moving to a develop their first cellular modem which will replace the Qualcomm modem in iPhone. The shares dropped as Qualcomm gets about 11% of its revenue from Apple.

So, one last thing that I want to talk about is the recent IPOs from DoorDash and AirBnb.

AirBNB also went public yesterday and [started](https://ibb.co/PCNjM3W) trading at $146, way above the $68 IPO price. This means the company has a [market cap](https://ibb.co/QNmGhqy) of over $100B, way higher than its rival Booking at $86B market cap and even [higher](https://ibb.co/cyp2hz1) than some of the biggest hotels in the world, Marriot & Hilton. The [stock](https://ibb.co/C9P3McG) even hit a new high of $165, I believe this happened as brokers started to get hands on the shares and orders started to fill in, but the stock did go back down to finish at $144, that means the stock gained more than 112% just in one day. The stock is down again more than 2% in pre-market guys.

I would avoid these stocks as much as I can as I believe they are well overhyped at the moment. I think we can see a pullback that may offer a better opportunity in AirBnb after the first earnings results. I would buy this company only if it drops to around 80$ as a price target, if not I maintain my sell opinion on the stock, though I personally, am not shorting any stock due to the risk of the high volatility associated with this companies as they have a very small share float.

While my opinion on [DoorDash](https://ibb.co/qkqSz1t) is that we might not see a pullback or correction as soon as AirBnb as demand will probably continue to be strong for at least a couple of quarters, before the growth slows down as well as very though future comps. We might see a drop in price then, as I think this stock is also well overvalued. I also maintain my sell opinion on this stock and just like with AirBNB, I am not going to touch this stock, I think a reasonable PT for DoorDash as a sell is about 100$. But I would try to stay away as much as possible, I‚Äôd rather go and find better growth opportunities in other companies, and not waste time and money on these 2 stocks.

Put it on your radar.",0.85,"As CTV options become more prevalent and advertising starts to ramp back up, the digital ad sector has been taking off lately with companies like trade desk (TTD) and Magnite (MGNI) mooning over the last few months. One smaller player that has caught my eye that hasn't had the same type of multi-bagger run yet is PERI (Perion Network). These guys have been around for a long time, but have recently started to revamp their business with some good acquisitions and added revenue streams in the last few years.

Great SA article posted yesterday which goes into a hell of a lot more detail and analysis than I will in this post (yeah, yeah, it's SA, but the article itself is actually pretty decent--go find it because I can't link it here). But the bottom line is things are looking solid heading into 2021 here. Just upped their guidance for next quarter, analysts targets all above current price with ""buy"" ratings, and they just renewed a four-year Microsoft contract expected to generate revenue between $170-190 million annually (according to their investor slide deck). Yes, that's close to a billion dollar contract with Microsoft for a company trading at a market cap of less than than $300 million. This is trading at a huge discount right now and could be an easy multi-bagger from here in my opinion. Stupidly undervalued right now in this sector compared to competitors (MGNI is the most comparable play in my opinion). Oh, by the way, Cathie and ARK are in here as well, with 160k shares as their third biggest holding in their IZRL ETF.

Buy in, or don't, I don't really care. But check it out if you are looking for new play that isn't TSLA, PLTR, or NIO (I'm loaded up in those as well, but I have to keep myself entertained with finding new stuff).

Anyway, I'll probably get downvotes for ""PuMpInG a SmAlL CaP,"" but oh well, i don't care if you buy or not. Do your own research, but this has been a money maker for me this week and wanted to put it on a few people's radars. Sure, it's a small cap, but it's a small float that can move quickly with good volume. Also, option volume and liquidity is actually pretty damn good with tight spreads usually (check out the OI on April 10c, lotta people been loading up and holding). It has had a great week on huge volume (2,000% above average) after raising guidance on Monday, and it also held up exceptionally well today despite the NASDAQ taking a fat dump. I bought a decent lot of April 10C contracts at open yesterday that I am up over 150% on already, but I am holding for a possible five to ten bagger here. Still accumulating shares at this level as well. A lot of upside potential here in my opinion. My near term price target is $15 by early 2021. $20 would then be my likely exit point on all of my calls (unless I am feeling greedy, which happens way too often, so probably....).

TL;DR: digital ad space, microsoft contracts, Cathie and ARK, analyst buy ratings up the ying yang. I'm in for 40 contracts of April 10C.",2020-12-10 00:57:52

PLTR - Technical Analysis from a Professional Investor - Update 12/8,0.94,"So I did an update 4 days ago telling you why PLTR at 22 was the short term bottom,

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k63z6b/pltr\_technical\_analysis\_from\_a\_professional/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k63z6b/pltr_technical_analysis_from_a_professional/)

now I will go over how to trade the stock in the next couple of weeks.

As you can see in the chart below, we are replicating the movements made by Nio in the first phase of its run-up. We had the initial run up from about $5/share to $16 and then a fall and consolidation to about $10. It then subsequently moved up to about $15 giving the illusion of a double top and trapping all the bears when it then fell to $12 before rocketing up to $20.

https://preview.redd.it/f2q9pv3310461.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4617e401f9dbbfc32d1e925972834c40306f529

Again, chart looks the same as Tesla in the transition from the first run-up to the second run-up. You had a short term top at around 185, a drop to 68 (much higher fib retracement likely due to more short seller interests being accumulated at this point), recovery to around 170 and then a small drop to 150 before the next leg up.

https://preview.redd.it/eguhknb1k0461.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7b8c5f61d6197e949a76d7be1b039feaa307f8f

&#x200B;

In a similar way, expect consolidation for a couple of days and a near term bottom of around 23-26 before the next leg moves up. If we go by Nio, expect a target of $41-45 over the next 2-3 weeks. So get out of your 12/11 weekly calls now, those won't pay out and will likely just eat theta.

https://preview.redd.it/wemw3ofszz361.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e3d6ba992b74ea6260ff956ba5c2dc300a5f8cf

Option convexity is also sort of at a mid point between the lows achieved on 12/2 and the extremes exhibited on 11/25, which tells you we are sort of nowhere near a short term bottom or a short term top.

https://preview.redd.it/xlpdfz1hzz361.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2d7e5841e6d5517b4c93d3e2d5182a26e392b12

I did not bother playing this expected short term volatility as I bought 1/15 calls at the $22 low. But you'll probably get another chance at it if we see PLTR at the 24-26 range.

**TLDR: roll out your 12/11 options, bet on 12/25 options at the earliest, best strikes are 25-35. Cashout at least 2/3 if PLTR hits $41-44.Don't be surprised if we have a couple more down 10% days this week to burn out the 12/11s.**

&#x200B;

Update1 (2:25PM): Rising wedge developing on the 5 minutes, don't be surprised by some big drops in the coming couple of days. Good time to build position.

Update 2 (11:00AM): had a initial drop. Got a another rising wedge. We are going below 27 today and probably bottom about 24-26. I doubt we‚Äôll move too much above 25 until next week. Again the 12/11s will expire worthless
 
Update 3 (10:45AM): we likely bottomed at 25.2. We had a double bottom this morning at 25.7. There is still a small chance maybe we'll drop down to 23-24, but its pretty unlikely at this point. We'll be somewhat range bound between 26-27 until next week when the full run-up will start.",2020-12-08 17:35:26

Do you want to bet against reddit? I have the answers,0.97,"I have been collecting and analyzing data from popular subreddits. This week I am looking at the options contracts that have been mentioned on the subreddits I track.  Specifically, I am looking at contracts expiring this Friday 12/11.    The data collected for this analysis was collected from 11/29 ‚Äì 12/5.  For Friday‚Äôs expiration there are 186 contracts and 330 mentions of these contracts.  The most popular contract is the 12/11 TSLA 600 Call with 14 mentions.  


The goal here is to track what reddit is following and to see how reddit preforms.  There is this notion that retail investors often fail to beat the market. This is why financial advisors recommend that you buy into the major ETF‚Äôs such as SPY.  As historically there have been few people that manage to beat the major Index‚Äôs year over year.  My hypothesis going into this week is that I should bet against the trends on reddit as typically the retail investor is wrong.  


Call Data


* Out of the 186 contracts 150 are calls (+80%+ Long)  

* 75.3% of the calls are out of the money

* The out of the money Calls are an average of 23% out of the money. 

* The in the money calls are an average of 19.3% in the money. 


Put Data


* Out of 186 Contracts 36 are puts

* 86.1% of the puts are out of the money

* The out of the money puts are an average of 20% out of the money

* The in the money puts are an average of 8% in the money 


On both the call and put sides the out of the money contracts are an average of 20%+ out of the money.  I am not that surprised as there is a lot of yolo culture on reddit.  It is surprising to see the number of contracts that are out of the money in general.  Out of the 186 contracts only 42 are in the money as of last Friday‚Äôs close. 

The most popular calls that are in the money are the 

* TSLA 570 ‚Äì 590 
* ACB 10.  

The most popular puts that are in the money are all NKLA.  

The most popular calls that are out of the money are the 

* TSLA 600 - 650, 
* GME 20, 
* PLTR 25 - 40, 
* AMD 100, 
* SPY 370 - 380,
* APHA 9.  

The most popular puts that are out of the money are 

* NKLA 15, 
* PLTR 15 ‚Äì 21, 
* NIO 40 
* ACB 7.  

As I said above my hypothesis going into this week is that the majority of these contracts will end up being losers.  Based on this data I would probably look to sell the 370 Spy Calls and TSLA 600 calls if my hypothesis turns out to be right.  For now this is just for fun, but I will be running more in-depth analysis to see if I find anything interesting. 

Edit For reference as of 12/7 Market Open:

* SPY 370 Calls: $2.10
* TESLA 600 Calls: $2500",2020-12-07 17:56:58

1. Some of you may know the initial life cycle of a stock after its IPO

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k4ezmfwt9q361.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e2bccafaf7b8be65602664bcfda034b5d121f55

I sat down this morning with a cup of coffee and briefly looked at NIO and Palantir stocks

And It is not always the case but something much more thought requiring and complicated

2) Basically, NIO and Palantir look like 2 distant realities

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c4vswn8b9q361.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d125665ae074fa251ecacf5bc455e188b39ed3e9

It did not go immediately into the main hype and It took 2 years to do so. Of course, before the end of May 2020 NIO was just a Chinese tech company with little awareness in America, being IPOed in the US, It explains such a time

But the more (time), the merrier (volatility), and the little awareness about NIO and how things are going in the company created a highly inefficient market. The stock rose from its low of about 1.20$ to 57.20$ (47.66 times of 4666%). It is a tech company, and Who doesn't love the juicy tech?

Also, there've been 2 small hypes before the main hype (as opposed to the graph above with its 1 small hype rise and the main hype rise)

(The diagonal blue line is the mean that is drawn based on the lows and highs on the graph above, the curve is the 200 EMA)

3) But Palantir is another story

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8xgi2wdc9q361.jpg?width=1128&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b17da2d42cb1e154779d83a5505283419a6c5cc

It started trading on 30 Sep. 2020, and It took just 1 month to start the main hype. There was no initial hype (well the kind of a rise that you can consider to be substantial, Before 30 October It just got up and down by approx. a 1 $, relative to the price before the rise of approx. 10 $)

There is a nice dip on 30 Oct and after that, there's a shallow but continuous rise before there's the dramatic rise in the price (the tendency that you can also see in NIO)

These two stocks crashed (Well, They actually just went down not substantially) right after they IPOed.

The market basically wanted to get to the dip and to trigger some selling activity just so the smartest traders can get more shares for cheap

There are 3 great dips on the trend of the main hype, in an upward channel manner in both NIO and Palantir. NIO has longer and shallower dips indicating the uncertainty and the lack of Information behind the stock. Palantir had dips ranging from a couple of hours to 2 days

The two dips before the main hype are below the mean (Which can be drawn initially before the main hype, using the low at the very beginning, further lows and highs and their support resistance channel levels, and the general upside direction, Just like in the pictures above).

This quick analysis takes the time period between when Stock IPOed and the top of the main hype.  The analysis doesn't look at what happens next after the stock reaches its hype top.

The coffee was good and the morning was nice and I hope that you can build a good strategy on the initial life cycle and behavior patterns of hype stocks.......

# GME Short Squeeze to 19+ Before Falling of a Cliff for Earrings?

GME has been in a rounding bottom since 11/30 and is 2/3 the way complete. The rounding bottom is a consolidation pattern.

It appears that a hidden bear wedge is forming - this could indicate downward projection.

If GME makes it up to the 18.30 - 19.30 range, expect a top and downtrend to appear. Perhaps just in time for earnings cliff dive?

Be mindful of a position fake out and GME to begin forming a cup and handle - bullish pattern.

Recommended Positions:

* If GME falls below 16.5 with momentum, play 16.5p 12/11 exp.
* And take profit at around 16-15.12 range.

# THE NIGHTMAN COMETH ONE LAST TIME to TALK ABOUT NIO

Possible long squeeze happening with NIO due to china delisting fears. IMO. They won't get delisted.

&#x200B;

Last ""Thursday, an analyst gave a negative view of China's EV industry, sending NIO's stock lower by 5%. UBS issued a note on NIO rival XPeng, cutting its rating from buy to neutral based largely on the huge run-up in valuation that XPeng had seen. NIO investors seemed to take that message to heart as well.""

&#x200B;

NIO is in a healthy downtrend channel and needs to hit support at around the 38.18 range to complete. It should bounce off resistance and head back to  39-40 level where it may find some resistance. If it breaks resistance at that level, anticipate NIO to climb to 41-42 range for the second resistance level. It may bounce or may exit the downtrend since the pattern will technically be complete. If it jumps out expect a  PT of 42-45 within 3-4 days of the breakout.

If NIO fails to break the first resistance level at 39-4o level, anticipate it to drop to the 38-36 range.

&#x200B;

NiO shouldn't go lower than 30. 30 PT is a danger zone. We are getting near the bottom so be mindful of your indicators and oscillators.

&#x200B;

# Suggested plays for NIO:

&#x200B;

* HEDGE: 42c 12/11, 42p 12/11
* If NIO breaks 44.28 resistance, convincingly, play a 44c 12/11 exp and trim or take profit at 45.11 - 51.93 (not getting even close to 51) range.
* If NIO breaks support at 41.16, convincingly, play 40p 12/11 exp and trim or take profit at 38.18 - 29.06 range.
* I recommend you let your hedge expire worthless or you could try to sell you put at the bottom and keep your call for on the way up - this is WSB after all.
* BIG BRAIN with bullish sentiment for next week towards NIO might hedge with a 42c 12/18 exp. and 42p 12/11. If you take that strategy. Good luck friend. Diamond hands.

&#x200B;

I may pay a visit from time to time.

"Basic Small Money Plays For a This Wild and Crazy Market - IPO's, SPAC's, and New Tech; Oh My!",0.68,"**One big thing stands out to me in the ""recent"" market** that seems like an old concept being pushed hard again\*\*:\*\*

**Some new IPO's/SPAC's, or** just **companies** that have been **under the radar** and already passed over for what appeared to be better long term investments, **are going for modern or interesting sounding names and tickers**, that may intended **to boost interest in younger investors.**

**LISTEN HERE:**

**THIS IS SO OBVIOUS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY, NO SHIT SHERLOCK, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.**

**SO DO IT THIS TIME, IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY! BUY BEFORE THE MEME GETS SOMEONE RICH THAT'S NOT YOU!**

The **new tickers that move** are ones that **have things that make them sound cool,** and **that's** really **all that matters.** Usually the **name is catchy,** the **ticker is** often **easy to remember and** might even look like it should go that Porsche **you're going to** buy when it's **finally** your turn to **get** rich and post gain **porn.**

**LOOK: These tickers don't require as much fundamental quantification**, compared to some REIT named $LAME buying up closed down dollar general store locations, or something equally boring to talk about. It's all about marketing and perception.

**THE GAMBLE:** What **I suggest** is going **long** on **shares** when you see these particular types of stocks hit the market, especially if you're hearing people asking about them a lot, because if people are interested in crap only because the ticker, product, or company name sounds cool, you may have a winner.

**Typically,** **you want to see if there's a little dip first. If you're already in, this is not the time to sell and try to time re-entry.**  **Some IPO's don't allow shorting for a certain duration,** but that doesn't mean price cannot drop initially. Also, **not all IPO's will run options until a certain number of days have passed,** and there may be some wait before hype is prepared to move the stock, **so watch the option volume very closely and see if it begins to look liquid.** Take this time to consider if the stock will have some sort level of excitement in it, and attract attention. It should sound cool. Honestly, **it should be something that you might not buy yourself, but** you'd definitely **want to try it out or learn more about what the heck this** ticker **thing is** trying to sell if you weren't so lazy and it was free.

We have seen things with **names like LAZR** recently, **pumped by Cramer**, with ooooooo, maybe a military contract, and ahhhh, cool cameras that can probably spot people really far away.

**RKT**, because it even if it has reasonable fundamentals, you know it had to go up for a bit, **because it's named rocket...**

**NIO, PLUG, LI, FCEL, FLIR, PLTR** (I haven't even read the Lord of the Rings series and I know the reference), **TSLA, NKLA, ZooM**, and so forth. **Many** of these companies **doubled, trippled, or** went up even **more,** in very short periods.

Now, **some of those companies** have some value, and some do not, or certainly **not worth** what **their local maxima** will become, so you want to **get in cheap and early as hype begins,** but ***before any major price move***, **and then just wait for the gains and GTFO of the stock unless it's run by some incredibly weird entrapreneur that gets regular interviews on any damn show he wants.** So much of the market is over bought, that people will buy any piece of crap that sounds cool. That's it. That's all you need to know.

**First, I suggest getting the WeBull app**. A lot of people have it, whether that's their broker or not, because it does a few things right, but **mainly it's a convenient way to find out what IPO's may be coming up**. **RKT, PLTR, and many others were announced well in advance via WeBull,** and **if you have notifications on** for it\*\*, you'll get the ""memo""\*\* that some of retail is getting. Now **don't go buying every IPO.** You want to **look for a** **product that sounds like it has future potential**, something **not fully tapped into yet,** and the **company name must grab your attention**. You want **a name that sounds exciting and fast paced** to retail. Something that **if you said it at the dinner table,** or around friends, **would the name make people seem honestly interested?**

I have been sitting through this bull run, selling positions early, not going in on the companies I mentioned, using rational reasoning for why to buy a stock. This is not the time for being completely rational. Your investment accounts should be Boglerific, but **your play money needs to find a home in these types of stocks**, **take the large gain when it comes, and dump** the stock **before everyone else** does.

Buy long duration vertical calls if they're available, but **don't plan to hold longer than whenever the spike comes.** **Vertical spreads help reduce IV cost somewhat** (usually) as the two strikes will partially cancel out each others vega, so this lets you get in with a defined risk amount. Shares are still the safer way, as puts will likely be not liquid enough at first to sell bull put verticals, and IPO's like this are more likely to tripple in the first 6 months than they are to become 1/3rd.

**THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE, AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A STRATEGY MOSTLY FOR AN OVERBOUGHT MARKET WITH LITTLE ELSE TO PICK FROM.**

## NIO Recap

**0DTE Prediction you should have chosen from the last post:**

* *""If NIO breaks support at 44.06 ish or bounces off resistance at 47.85 ish, expect downwards PT of 44.03 - 38.53 and below.*
* *Play: 42p 12/04 exp or 43p 12/04 (only play in the morning)""*

## Today's Price Movements

Open: 47.90

High: 45.16

Low: 41.65

Close: 43.04

&#x200B;

**It would help if you closed your position when NIO hit 41.65. No diamond hands.**

**Monthly Prediction you should have chosen from the last post:** 

* *""If NIO breaks support at around 44.41, look for 37.32 by 12/7 - 12/9 and 35.97 by 12/8 - 12/14.""*
* *Play $30p 12/16 exp""*

&#x200B;

**Monthly Outlook**

On the 1D timeframe, NIO doesn't have support until 33.56. However, a pivot point sits at 40.54.

Theoretically, a pivot point is a price level used by professional traders to assess whether prices are bullish or bearish.

""If the prevailing market price is above the base pivot point, it suggests bullishness. If the market is below the base pivot, it suggests a bearish tenor.""

On 12/2, NIO reached through the pivot point and jumped back up, creating a long wicked heilkin ashi. Notice how the open and high prices are currently synched on the downtrend? Theoretically, this indicates a STRONG bearish momentum. 

The next support level on the 1D timeframe sits at 33.16

&#x200B;

0DTE Prediction you should have chosen from the last post:

* *If AMD breaks resistance at 94.02, look for PT 94.75 - 96.08+*

## Today's Price Movements

Open: 92.58

**Dec. Sentiment: Neutral (may have reached the top but let's see)**

# TSLA RECAP

Weekly Prediction you should have chosen from the last post *(I called it 0DTE on the last post. My mistake)*: 

1. If TSLA breaks through resistance at 595.68, look for a price target of 621.85 between 12/4 - 12/8+
2. Play 620c 12/11 exp.

## Today's Price Movements

Open: 591.01

High: 599.04

Low: 585:50

Close: 599.04

&#x200B;

It would have helped if you didn't close your positions.

TSLA extended its uptrend support and has currently wedged itself into a rising wedge (bearish). 

&#x200B;

**12/7 Weekly Outlook**

Tesla needs a nice pop on Monday to the resistance of the rising wedge, which is right near the resistance level of 622.66. It exceeds that price, then the bearish wedge has failed, and TSLA's sentiment will be bullish.

&#x200B;

**Dec. Sentiment: Neutral (may have reached the top but let's see)**

&#x200B;

# PLTR Recap

Weekly and Monthly Prediction you should have chosen from the last post *(I called it 0DTE on the last post. My mistake)*: 

* *If PLTR closes above 27.48, then look for a PT of 32.87 between 12/11 and 12/18.*
* *Play 34c 12/11 exp. or 34c 12/18 exp*
* *If PLTR breaks support around 22.86 the look for a PT of 21.22 - 16.02 between 12/11 and 12/18 (For some reason, I didn't include a position for this possibility. For next weeks prediction that will drop Monday morning, ill provide a prediction)*

&#x200B;

**Monthly Outlook**

PLTR is deciding whether to bounce off uptrend support or leap out. We will have a more precise direction at close on Monday. 

## Today's Price Movements

Open: 24.88

High: 25.24

Low: 23.51

Close: 23.85

&#x200B;

It would have helped if you didn't open a weekly/monthly position because PLTR didn't close around 27.48, and I didn't provide a position for the bearish possibility. 

&#x200B;

0DTE Prediction you should have chosen from the last post:

* If PLTR bounces off resistance at 24.37, look for a price target around 22.36 - 18.64.
* Play 22.5p 12/04 exp

**I'll mark this one as a loss. Not good enough.**

&#x200B;

BUT it would have helped if you closed your 0DTE position when PLTR hit 23.51

The difference between an autist and a retard,0.92,"Although I haven't been here for long, I've started to notice a certain dichotomy between two different types of WSB users. On one hand, there are the retards, and on the other hand there are the autists. Mind you, both retards and autists can gain money, and both retards and autists can lose money. The difference lies in how they do it. 

The retards are the public face of WSB and its most vocal cohort. Mind you, I'm not looking down on retards. I've made plenty of trades that can properly be described as ""retarted"" rather than autistic, like YOLOING my whole account on SPY puts and UXVY shares before the election. 

I've also learned quite a bit from the retards of this sub. The most important lesson has been not to be too uptight about money. After I blew up 70% of my account, my brain was telling me to get the hell out of the casino, but you all gave me the inspiration to pick up the pieces and YOLO them again. I've since recovered more than half of my Robinhood ""tuition."" 

But WSB's retards have also taught me what not to do. After NIO and PLTR rose precipitously most of November, many of you bought weeklies, and many of your portfolios (and the portfolios of your suggestible family members, coworkers, and friends) were decimated. It seems that buying calls at the peak of a long green run without any coherent thesis as to why the stock is still undervalued is not the way. ""Retard strength"" can move microcaps, but it can't move stocks with a float of more than a billion shares. Therein lies the difference between the retards and autists of WSB. 

The autists of WSB form their thesis before the run and before the retards have piled into their echo chamber. They might be early, but they are never late. There are a lot of super smart people on this sub, offering top-notch DD, but their voices are not always heard. Sometimes the memes come to life, and there's no longer any need to approach them rationally, but TSLA is the exception, not the norm. We've all been spoiled by the brilliance of its meme power, but that light can no longer lead us to Valhalla. We need to be smart, and put our faith in the true autists. 

There will always be the FDs that go up 5000% and the AAs that go up 600% when we meant to buy calls on AAL, but the law of averages dictates that the retards will lose. I may be a retard, and I have certainly lost, but I'm trying to turn it around. Who's with me?",2020-12-04 16:54:47

The Future Of Plastics,0.75,"Good Morning Degenerates,

&#x200B;

Welcome to today's History & Science Class. Today, we will be learning about plastics.

Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are renewably-derived polymers that are entirely biodegradable and compostable. As you may know, other polymers require industrial recycling to be broken down. Authentic tards may be familiar with the PHA firm Metabolix, now called Yield10 Bioscience, which sank millions of tendies a few years ago developing the same science. The market was not ready then - but now - This Is The Way.

If you haven't heard from the likes of Robert Downey Jr yet, then here's the present. We generate over 300 million metric tons of plastic - equal to the weight of the entire human population. You think electric cars and solar power are the only way to solve our problems and go green? Think again.

The PHA market is approximately 1% of the entire plastic market. The largest barrier for this emerging market is the cost of raw materials, and refinding said materials. With that, the inability to achieve economies of scales is the largest, and one of the only major restrictions on the market.

Now turn to Danimer Scientific. This company has been a leader in PHAs for years on years as a privately-run company. Now I'm only half-stupid so I'm not sure if any posts have been made about this, but the SPAC Live Oak Aquisition Corp ($LOAK) has a definitive merger agreement with Danimer Scientific, providing $200 million in equity of the $890 closing equity valuation. Danimer Scientific is anticipated to go public as early as the end of this year, or early 2021.

What's this? Too good to be true? You heard me right, bitch. You better steal every last dime from your wife's boyfriend's wallet, because this is the future. One's first thought might be, "" Well, if this failed before, who's to say it yields now?""

Hear ye, motherfucker. Think:

\-Green New Deal

\-Net-zero emissions and carbon neutrality

\-Global Paris Agreement

&#x200B;

Danimer already has deals with the likes of Coca-Cola, Columbia, and Nestle. With the current deals they have, they are already at capacity. The funding secured from the merger, private investors, etc. will provide the necessary funding to develop another factory. With the funding already secured, they are prepared to increase production capacity 10x by 2025, thus increasing scale and profitability. The company has only around 20 million in debt, and has the growth potential of fucking Apple or Tesla. I will pour my life savings into this just to prove that I am right. I'll see you on the other side bitches.

&#x200B;

So you bought NIO and PLTR calls....what to do now.,0.8,"You are an idiot. But you know that. Your wives BF won't even give you knucks anymore. Hopefully you didn't completely wreck your account. What you need to do now is be smart about how you make your tendies back. There will be a few of you retards who get lucky with some FD's and make it back in two days but thats not going to work for all of you. 

What you need to do now is have a plan and know it might take a bit longer. IF you still believe in either of these companies, I mean actually have good understanding of their business and potential catalysts over the next 3-6-9 months then you should reposition into longer dated calls. You will have a good shot to make most of your money back. But it will take time. Don't hold onto your current piece of shit contracts. They are most likely going to 0. Also consider buying some stock. Again wont pay immediately but these companies can still do 100% moves over a relatively short period (6-12 months) or even faster. 

If your butt hole hurts so bad from this beat that the sight of NIO and PLTR gives your hemorrhoids then it's time to do the above strategy into a new ticker all together. Again don't sit on losers too long. If you can extract value do it, but have a plan before you sell anything. 

Anyway, I'm sure you all bought more FD's and will go bust by Friday. So DM me your wives number so I can take her out to Chili's and get a handjob in the bathroom.

>""Monday will be the start of SPY's 4th day of consolidation, so something has to give IMO, but she could consolidate on Monday, so watch out for pump fakes.

On the daily chart, if SPY can get to 366.29 - 372.50 and find support, the w-shaped recovery will be in play, and you could play a lotto380c and watch spy get to 381.90 - 398.03.

CRM BUYS SLACK | NIKOLA STOCK CRASH | PFIZER APPROVED IN UK| STOCK MARKET NEWS [12-02],0.82,"**SALESFORCE CRUSHES EARNINGS AND ACQUIRES SLACK, NIKOLA STOCK CONTINUES TO TUMBLE AS WE FINALLY GET THE FIRST VACCINE APPROVAL IN THE UK, LET‚ÄôS DISCUSS THIS AND MORE ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET**

Hey everyone! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/PzNKCYh) leading the way up almost 1,3%, finishing at a new record high, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/syB7wP4) also up over 1,1% and finishing at a new record high, while the [DOW](https://ibb.co/HggpWGF) had smaller gains but was still up to intraday records before finishing over +0,6% for the day. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/SDCq7vf) rose for the day after opening at 20,2 and as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/0n1TDKt) big gains were led by the FAANG stocks with Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix gaining over 2% for the day while Amazon and Microsoft also were up at least 1%. This pulled the big indexes higher as they account for a big part of them.

Over 60% of companies were advancing on average volume while companies moving above important moving averages continued to climb as we are going into a very risky market, as to many companies are trading high at the moment and are due for a correction. [CHART](https://ibb.co/DfgJ12R)

The biggest gaining [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/T8NPW6W) yesterday were Communications, Financials and Technology with most sectors being in the green, except industrial, as the laggards from yesterday were small cap growth companies and especially those from CHINA, like NIO, Alibaba and others, that have suffered from the recent news that the US is looking to delist some of them if they do not meet new standards. [CHART](https://ibb.co/gmpRVWW)

Here are the most interesting economic events and data for [TODAY](https://ibb.co/cyp7x5W), as we will see how Mortgage Applications and ADP Jobs are going. Afterwards a couple of FED leaders will speak before we can take a look at how the Petroleum Inventories are going.

While [GREAT NEWS](https://ibb.co/1d6y1yh) started to pop in the early morning as the UK has become the first country to authorize the Pfizer vaccine for use.

This news are already baked in the market in my opinion as investors were already expecting this to happen sooner rather than later, but this are still very good news to hear, as a confirmation is still great to have, rather than just expectations. I expect the US will soon follow in the next 10-14 days to approve both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine, that might just have a bigger impact on the stock market, but I would be careful until then, as we might get a correction in the stock market after this huge rally before we can move on even higher, as I fully expect this bull market to continue into 2021 and 2022.

Well yesterday, as I expected Nikola [tumbled again](https://ibb.co/2hzPCJL) after the insider lockup period expired, as only the possibility of Milton selling his shares has spooked the market after an already bad day with the GM deal disappointing investors. As the original deal is null and void with GM not taking any stake in Nikola or helping with the engineering or manufacturing of the Badger pickup truck. The only good thing in sight for the company is the possible hydrogen fueling station network partnership by year end as announced by the management. I maintain my sell opinion on this stock as I predicted a 15-16$ in the future when the stock was trading over 20, I think it has more room to go down, it might go to single digits in the long run, as the company has become very shady after the fiasco with the misleading tactics and no breaking new fuel cell technology.

On the other hand, Salesforce crushed [earnings](https://ibb.co/XCzz5Mz) expectations, as they beat the EPS by almost 1$ and had a revenue beat of over 160 million$. They also raised [guidance](https://ibb.co/JRf2G3j) for both revenue and EPS for next year way above the consensus while also maintaining cash and equivalents at over $9B, up 45% for the year.

The company also officially [announced](https://ibb.co/whYVfzC) the acquiring of Slack in a deal worth almost $28B. This will result in the Slack software being incorporated in every aspect of Salesforce cloud offering. This 2 will be the biggest competitors yet for Microsoft. So, I believe after the dust settles, and CRM stock finally gets back on track, we will have a good long term growth opportunity with Salesforce.

Slack also reported earnings yesterday after the bell as the company [posted](https://ibb.co/N6Qnw7M) a beat of estimates and an increase in paid customers and billings.

We also got some [numbers](https://ibb.co/6rNGCnZ) from Cyber Monday sales as the spending increase over 15% but, this was not enough to meet all the estimates as holiday shopping has been probably spread through the whole month of November and will continue to go strong in December in my opinion.

While on the economic front news were not so great as the [November ISM](https://ibb.co/3yM4Hwc) index fell shy of expectations with light vehicles [sales](https://ibb.co/PG09TRf) dropping by almost 1 million from last month and are way below the year ago period.

But we did see some big improvements in [construction spending](https://ibb.co/cc5z2wq), as the numbers came in about half a % better than consensus and are up 3,7% year over year while the [November PMI](https://ibb.co/6JzRnJ1) index saw the biggest improvement in over 6 years.

The biggest earnings that will be released today will be from [CrowdStrike](https://ibb.co/RvSk8SJ) and [Okta](https://ibb.co/RDrYy8K), as I expect both of them to turn out a positive EPS, as we might see some momentum in this stocks if they don‚Äôt disappoint.

I greatly expect the [IPO](https://ibb.co/pKzxhmK) of AirBNB, as this could become a company that will benefit a lot from the reopening of the world in the next year or two.

"JPMorgan published the article that said Nikola‚Äôs 25% dive is a good buying opportunity, let‚Äôs look at that claim",0.91,"***Papa Elon warned us on twitter about EV SPACs.***

When someone tells you to buy a stock without a large DD to help their argument **do not buy.**

 **The 25% sell-off in Nikola on Monday represents a good buying  opportunity for investors as the company is no longer distracted by its  Badger pickup truck, JPMorgan said.** 

 **""We think this is a positive outcome for NKLA over the medium to  longer term, since the company can now focus on the core Class 8 truck  initiative,"" JPMorgan said.** 

**NIKOLA TRE**

**Financial Times and Wall Street Journal** both confirmed the rumor that Nikola signed a contract with Romeo Power to use their batteries in the Tre 

The Tre is the only way they have to get something on the road. They have NO working technology. They don't have a proper chassis, so the Tre uses an Iveco chassis. They have no battery so they are stuck white labeling Romeo modules in a horrendous pack design. 

 So, a little background on battery design. When you are designing a battery you have two separate things that you have to account for: capacity, which gives you range, and voltage, which allows you to provide necessary power. You get both of these by connecting together cells. 

 There are two different ways you can connect cells: In parallel, which increases capacity while keeping voltage unchanged, or in series which increases capacity AND voltage. An automotive scale battery will have cells connected in parallel and then those groups in series. 

 The problem comes when, like Nikola, you are stuck using off the shelf modules: For these, the cell groups are already set for you and you are stuck with them. If it isn't what you need for your battery design, you're stuck. This is why custom battery design is crucial. 

 In the case of Nikola, the Hermes modules they are using from Romeo Power have a capacity of 10 kWh and have a voltage of about 100 V when topped off.  To power their truck, they need 800V, so that's 8 modules connected in series. 

 But this sets the capacity for them: 8 modules of 10 kWh each comes out to 80 kWh. While that is a great number for the passenger vehicles that Romeo presumably designed these modules for, it isn't nearly enough for a semi truck. The Tre needs 720 kWh 

So they need 72 Hermes modules. But they can't just put them in series or the voltage will be 7200 Volts, far too much to be safe in an EV. So it is impossible to properly design a battery pack using these modules, and Nikola was forced to improperly design one. 

**NIKOLA TWO**

It has only been on the road once, when they delivered a nearly empty load of beer a couple of miles for a publicity stunt. Video shows it creeping along at 10 or 15 mph 

Nikola Two For those who don't know, that's the two trucks that they had Bosch design and build for them a couple of years ago. 

He claimed that it could do 0-60 in under five seconds, when anyone could see it took at least 10 seconds. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSiWPNe2llU&feature=emb\_logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSiWPNe2llU&feature=emb_logo)

1. The range extender power was dramatically reduced. 

2. The battery was made smaller, which not only decreases electric range but also available power.  

3. Nikola most likely replaced the power cells of the One with energy cells in the Two.  

4. They replaced the two speed transmission with a single speed.  

Two speed gearboxes are hard, so Nikola just dropped it. Now, you would be able to make up for the loss of the second gear by just cranking up the power (this is Tesla's approach) but instead Nikola REDUCED the power. The result is this hapless machine that can't go on the road. 

Nikola spent two or three precious years making an utterly failed design that they can't do anything with except creep around the parking lot with guests while they shout above the howl of the radiator fans.  

The truck is worthless. Completely road unworthy, by their own admission. It has only been on the road once, when they delivered a nearly empty load of beer a couple of miles for a publicity stunt. Video shows it creeping along at 10 or 15 mph. No wonder it's parking lot only. 

There is ONE time we did see the Two driving kind of fast. It's in a video called, predictably, ""Nikola Two in Motion"". The video description is almost a word for word copy of that of the famous video of the One rolling down the hill. 

**TLDR:  Nio was trading at 7 dollars with actually technology and vehicle sales earlier this year, so nikola should be valued at penny stock status.  just my opinion due to risks of being** ***delisted due to defrauding investors.***

***^(Disclaimer:  Above information was gathered from reliable sources, likely those whom provided short sellers information regarding Nikola. None of the above information was created or fabricated by me and was fact checked to the best of my ability.  i merely seek out reliable sources on the internet.)***",2020-12-02 07:43:40

Even if this vote passes, the companies get THREE YEARS to comply with the US about their stock exchanges being audited by US companies. Before you say NIO is audited by an American company, no it's not, it's a Chinese branch of that company and the US wants their own hooligans in there, which by law in China is not allowed because Chyna #1

Here's why you shouldn't panic:

Look at fucking Baillie Gifford and Company who own 8.91% of NIO who KNEW about the bill proceeding to the house from passing the senate in MAY 2020. They increased their ownership by over  ELEVEN MILLION SHARES, don't know how much money that is my smooth brained companion? That's over a $495M bet on NIO going upsies.

Same goes for nio and tesla paperhand cucks who sold today based off Nikola tanking after the Lockout period ending. YOU KNEW THIS WAS A SCAM. Options merely allowed people to make money on a clear falling knife stock, and if you yolod into pltr weeklies or owned nkla stonks you deserved to give your wendys paycheck to thetagang.


My point being is to DO YOUR OWN FUCKING RESEARCH BEFORE entering a position, not AFTER.


Nio is looking extremely bullish in 2-5 years, a forecast of $300 is not unlikely. This is not ""long term"" in stock terms at all.

Same with pltr. We know tesla will continue to experience meme levels of growth until elon dies and it tanks, or they end up turning more thsn a 1% profit. Either way don't doubt lord musk.

SPAC deal of the day: LUMINAR - GORES METROPOULOS MERGE,0.76,"Luminar makes LIDAR sensors and software for vehicles. Lidar sensors, which use laser light pulses to render precise images of the environment around the car, are seen as essential by **many automakers** to allow higher levels of driver assistance right up to making them capable of **self-driving**. The combined company will retain the name Luminar Technologies Inc. and list on the Nasdaq under the symbol ""LAZR‚Äù. Since the announcement in august, GMHI stock is up 38%, bringing the mkt cap to $1.7 Bln. The deal should be completed by Q1 2021 and the merge pro forma implied enterprise value of approximately $2.9 Bln and a market capitalization of approximately $3.4 Bln, so today we are trying to understand if there‚Äôs more room for tendies after the *bullish bonanza* of the previous week.

**Gentlemen you had my curiosity ... but now you have my attention**

There are some serious players behind this deal so let‚Äôs break them down:The deal includes $400 million of cash from Gores Metropoulos, whose founder is a private equity professional, $200 million financing by investors including tech billionaire **Peter Thiel** (PayPal, Palantir), GoPro Inc founder Nick Woodman, Volvo Cars Tech Fund and VectoIQ, the firm that helped Nikola Corp go public through a SPAC.

Not only, they have a long list of clients who are all willing to pay big bucks to get their hands on sensors as soon as 2022.

**Ehy but w8 a sec, I can see NIO there but no TESLA, WHERE‚ÄôS MUSK DADDY?!?...Why Tesla Won‚Äôt Use LIDAR**

*Let me quote the greatest absolute madman of our century: LIDAR is a fool‚Äôs errand‚Ä¶ and anyone relying on LIDAR is doomed.*LIDARS are expensive and prone to be damaged, also not very smart in recognizing object, that‚Äôs why Musk has opted for the proprietary VISION software which enables TESLA cams to understand the surrounding environment instead of shooting stupid lazer beams. Surely a great approach but right now their technology has a gap to bridge as they stated in one of their last meetings. Whether they will succeed or not isn‚Äôt really important for a company which aims to get on the market hopefully sooner than them. Obviously, companies such as Daimler and Volvo (which historically sold **safety** as their key selling point)  would be very happy to sell AD4 cars by 2022.

**Ok but why tf should I buy shares of a company founded by a 17 years old dropout?**

Surely there are many companies working on similar projects such as Waymo, Cruise, Argo, and Aurora, which aim to reach level 5 of autonomous driving (fully autonomous), but Luminar hits a different market. With a more modest target of hitting level 4 of autonomous driving, Luminar focuses on long-distance vision, key for highway driving. Yet, this is also a crowded market since players like Velodyne and others exist. Well not so crowded maybe, Velodyne has lost clients in the last year, it had Ford but they partnered with Luminar...they had Weymo (Google) but they went for their own road just as Tesla. Not to mention that Velodyne sensors have a crazy price at $25K.

**Since this is a DD post, I will not get into the technical details of why their technology has** ***some*** **breakthroughs, but let‚Äôs break down some more numbers**

We don‚Äôt have balance sheets so we will have to rely on their presentation (which is where all the images come from btw). They expect 90% of future revenue coming from their 50+ already signed partnerships, and with a 50% + margin, selling both hardware **AND** software, this could be a great company to invest in (or just go for quick tendies who am I to judge).

https://preview.redd.it/5bx2vlgdym261.png?width=954&format=png&auto=webp&s=16d5769f3da85b8b7bdc4074a38b04348d8c7860

You can check further technical details about their technology and implementation on their presentation but the last figures I want to concentrate on is the following: as of 2020 there is no other LIDAR long-vision competitor, also their price tag is about $1000 for the IRIS sensor, which is 25 times cheaper than its closest competitor. This could really scale up quickly if the outsourcing production process is handled correctly, which by the way will take place in Thailand and Mexico.

I had to close my position. Felt sick to my stomach knowing I could lose roughly another $10K if NIO continued to drop during the week. I'm sure NIO will now recover a few points and I'm going to hate myself more but I had to do this. Couldn't concentrate at work, I was just staring at the stock price hover around $47.00. I closed the position at $47.50. 

My portfolio is still up lifetime by a good amount but I'm angry at myself for depositing the money to make this gamble. Hopefully I can make some smaller trades to recover the loss over time.

Guess I'm part of the crew now.

VALE is the next EV Hype Train,0.74,"In my opinion, the days of the 10% pumps every day for EV stocks are over, for now, and have entered a period of consolidation. VALE, however, has been solidly rising every single day.

I think VALE is the next meme stock because (1): VALE has the largest supply of materials used to make electric batteries and (2) the market for EV's is starting to become oversaturated. People haven't even taken into account the main name brand automakers that are adding more EV's to their fleet or converting current vehicles. So while there is only room for a specific amount of players and their is a ""cap"" on the market, as most Americans only own one vehicle, the inherent value of materials and batteries are unlimited, as every EV will need them.

Long story short, why gamble on specific EV names when there will only be a few winners? The true winners will be the supply chain that has a death grip on those industries regardless if it's Tesla, NIO, Toyota, GM, or Xpeng. At end of the day, the winner will be TSLA and the automakers people are already familiar with: Toyota, Honda, Ford, GM, etc. Not some obscure name like SOLO that operates out of a mall kiosk.

TESLA NEWS | NIO SALES | NIKOLA STOCK CRASH | STOCK MARKET NEWS & MORE [12-01],0.92,"**Tesla and NIO shares are jumping after good news, while NIKOLA tumbles after GM goes for a much smaller agreement, the stock market loses ground as investors take profits, let‚Äôs talk about this and much more about the stock market**

Hey everyone and Welcome! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/2g68hFq) finish about flat for the day, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/cr8CXVz) finished about half a percent down for the day and the [DOW INDUSTRIAL](https://ibb.co/9tFCX3j) was the biggest losers down almost 1% thought all 3 of them were down even bigger intraday. So, both the SP and the DOW finished with record monthly gains, the SP finish up 10,9% for the month above the previous record of 10,2% exactly 40 years ago, while the DOW finished up 11,9% and topped the previous record from 1987 with the Nasdaq also having its best month since the middle of the dot-com boom in 2001. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/4g07SHm) also finished down more than 1% for the day though at one point it almost hit the 23 mark.

Almost 70% of companies were declining yesterday on above average volume, as I believe investors were taking profits after the big gains from this huge November rally that we had. [CHART](https://ibb.co/0XvY72g)

Energy was the biggest loser yesterday as the whole [sectors](https://ibb.co/JBTt3Bt) finished down more than 5% while the only 2 sectors in the green were Technology and Health Care as we saw [value plays](https://ibb.co/SBGP6jS) struggling through the day while large cap growth companies were gaining, led by Apple as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/xf7mqtc), which finished the day up over 2% while the whole financial and energy sectors were down big.

Here are the biggest economic [data](https://ibb.co/yV5rQ23) that we are expecting today, as we will see numbers from the MARKIT PMI and the ISM INDEX with vehicle sales arriving later in the day. Also only one big company is expected to report earnings today, [Salesforce](https://ibb.co/YTK19Tr), which is also expected to close a deal today to buy Slack in a cash-only deal. Salesforce is expected to maintain its EPS flat year over year with revenues increasing by more than 16%. I fully expect this to be beaten as this company has gone under appreciated in my opinion as smaller cloud companies have seen the bulk of the stock market gains. If they manage to buy Slack that will be a very positive thing for the company‚Äôs future as they will move on to bring a new challenge to the Microsoft bundle. [SLACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/GRjM1wk)

Great news came in the early morning today, as the OECD [revised](https://ibb.co/mc2dhhd) it‚Äôs GDP contraction up 0,3% with a real GDP growth forecasted at over 4% next year and 3,7% in 2022 as China is expected to account for one-third of the world economic growth next year, it might be the time to get more into that part of the stock market as they are expected to have a GDP growth of 8% next year.

Also, despite dropping more than 3% yesterday, Tesla saw it‚Äôs shares bounce back after the [news](https://ibb.co/hdMz1px) that it will be added at full float-adjusted market cap all at once on Dec. 21 due to its ability to accommodate big trades. With other good news coming yesterday also as China finally [approved](https://ibb.co/6n8hzP7) the selling of the Model Y in the country.

Also relating to the EV world, NIO just [announced](https://ibb.co/m91nYNp) while writing this post an increase of over 100% in delivery numbers for November to over 5 thousand cars. As they company keeps it over 100% year over year deliveries increase and are expected to continue the accelerations of production capacity to accommodate the bigger order numbers.

While the hydrogen power Nikola seen it‚Äôs share drop yesterday after a worse than expected [deal](https://ibb.co/1nQ2bb5) with GM, as GM has pulled back from its initial far bigger commitment with Nikola as the 2 companies signed a non-binding memorandum that expires at the end of next year, so things may get even worse for Nikola as they also scrapped plans to build the Nikola Badger electric pickup and will refund order deposits for the truck. This resulted in an over 25% drop in Nikola [shares](https://ibb.co/ZMMj5rY) and I expect this to go even lower, as the former CEO Milton will see about 130 million shares unlocked today and a total unlock of 161 million shares, that is more than the [current free float](https://ibb.co/z8vzVTj) shares available for the company at 117 million. If he decides to sell those, that will crush the stock‚Ä¶ So, I think a 15-16 $ price in the near future is possible even with Milton selling his shares.

Good news for 2 of the biggest 3 companies in the world Apple and Amazon [announced](https://ibb.co/RCwxB2s) that they will team up to offer new cloud computing services for AWS users to be able to create and test apps remotely. This will be a big positive for both companies as Amazon will benefit from more cloud services usage while Apple continues to expand the software and services business.

Other great news came for retailers as Shopify [announced](https://ibb.co/KLD25BH) that sales were up 75% year over year as the Black Friday to Cyber Monday sales are booming, this bolds well for companies like Lowe‚Äôs, Home Depot, Amazon and many others.

While on the vaccine front, Moderna‚Äôs candidate is [expected](https://ibb.co/HB8fdnm) to be review in mid-December. I believe the stock has gone way over it‚Äôs head and has passed big players in the pharma industry like Vertex and Regeneron though for Moderna this will be they‚Äôre first product to be released to the market, I think this stock is well over-hyped at this price, I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs worth more than 100$ in the long-run as more vaccines will become available with far cheaper prices.

The only big company that reported earnings yesterday was [ZOOM](https://ibb.co/FB33wzw) as they beat expectations by [23 cents](https://ibb.co/GJXzrxj). The stock did fall more than 5% in after-hours trading as I expected as the total number of paying customers was only up 17% quarter over quarter with far bigger increases in free users that created bigger bills and drove the profit margins lower to 66% way below the 72% analysts expected. I believe the company faces a though 2021 year as they will have very difficult comps to take on, but I believe this will remain a winner in the longer run. So I sold out of my position on Zoom before this earnings but I will keep an eye on them, if the price drops below 400$ I would be willing to buy the stock once again.

Meanwhile Biden has announced [his top picks](https://ibb.co/8XrnvpQ) for economic appointments and nominations and I believe this are very friendly picks for the stock market as he has gone with more central liberal picks and hasn‚Äôt gone to far to the left.

So I still believe the stock market is in a bull run for the moment with lot of great catalysts like the [PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION](https://ibb.co/T26q9Fz) being more and more certain, and a very likely split government after the Georgia Senate runoff election. So, with at least 2 vaccines right around the corner and treatments for the illness also getting better by the day, this will lead to a gradual reopening of the economy as less and less industries will suffer and the whole economy will eventually go back to normal. Also, the end of the US-China trade war might be in sight or at least a reduction in the trade tensions between the two biggest economies as Biden is close to taking over the Presidency in the US.

What I learned from half year of investing (and trading),0.94,"Sup retards, I am writing this to share what I learned in my small time of investing and trading till now. Of course there are a lot of retards here who are less retarded than I am, and so know more about investing than I do. This is partly to keep a note to myself (and make it public), so I don't repeat the same mistakes again. And partly to give some pointers to those here who are more retarded than me.

TL;DR: Stonks don't always go up. Get your emotions in line, especially jealousy of people posting their 1000+% gain porn. pre-market is a bitch. do your DD and don't just buy highly upvoted tickers. good money can be made in safer plays as well (like buying Shopify when it dropped to 900 due to vaccine news.). PLTR & NIO TO THE MOON.

1. This is something you would already know. There are a lot of people here posting 1000+% gains in a few weeks/months. But there are a lot lot more than that who are not making that, and in fact losing. I know you know that as well. So don't fucking get jealous and play stupid gambles (like buying fucking nikola at fucking 79$). You are already a retard, you already have a disadvantage compared to those outside. Don't let your emotions get the better of you as well.
2. Pre-market is fucked up. Never buy a gamble stock just by seeing high pre-market rise. You will almost always lose. 
3. You're new to WSB, you are seeing people posting a lot of tickers that are going to be the next NIO or the next PLUG. Don't go buying all those ticker. When someone posts a DD, don't just scroll down and comment 'All I read was buy' and buy the stock. Do your own DD.
4. (This may not apply to all) Try to limit the number of stocks you're holding to a minimum. Diversification is good but make sure you're not going overboard (like having only 2000$ to invest/trade and buying 40 tickers with that). Even if all those 40 stocks are hot growth stocks, you're not gonna make a lot of money because a lot of them WILL go down. Buy the stocks in which you feel confident that they will go up in some time. Don't buy something just because it has been going up a lot and everyone is saying it'll go up.
5.  Hold what you've bought for some time if you believe in the stocks short term/ long term capability. Don't sell it as soon as you're down some 5-10%. If you do that you'll just be buying high selling low all the stocks. As a personal example: I really believe in Unity's business and capability. I bought unity at 95, but got scared when it fell down to 86, then, as soon as it hit 95 again I sold. I was stupid, Now unity is 150. Believe in yourself more than some random retards on WSB.
6. I have made more money when hyped stock fall, compared to when hyped stocks rise. Invest in what seems safer (and can give good returns as well). For ex. when pfizer vaccine news came out, Shopify and Zoom fell like crazy. Even though I feel Zoom stock valuation is sooooo fucking stupid, I bought the dip and sold both the stocks just yesterday for about 20-30% gains on both. - This is really subjective, but I like this more compared to investing in PLTR at 30 or NIO at 50 (By the way I have positions in both of them and am about 100% up on both, so PLTR, NIO to moon). Remember that losses are also big in high growth stocks just like gains.
7. Keep a fucking target of how much return youre looking for. Dont get distracted by posts every day on WSB posting their 1000+% returns. You need 25-30% return a year to get rich eventually (this is just my personal target). Have a separate account for trading where you've trying to get crazy gains (and actually getting crazy losses), and keep the amount in that account minimum.

I know all this is just a repeat of some obvious things everyone says and my post may just get removed. Who cares.

Another thing: my experience here is just from stocks and not from options. I am from India and it is illegal for us to trade options in US market. 

Finally, even though everyone in WSB is a retarded autist and they just jack off to their gains and other's losses. I've learned a lot from posts in this sub. And this is also a really good sub for discovering stocks to do DD on. Many other positives of WSB, just not mentioning them here.

AMD popped out of the gate, and hit about 90 ish. It quickly topped and fell back down to the opening price. AMD took a steady climb up to 93 ish the rest of the day.

Look for AMD to trade in the 90-96 range tomorrow. It shouldn't go any lower than 89 ish IMO. Anything lower than 87 ish and AMD will fall to 86-83.

AMD Plays for 12/1:

* If AMD holds support on its uptrend channel at around 92.16 you could scalp a 94c 12/4. Trim and leave a runner for 96+.
* If AMD breaks support on its uptrend channel, expect a 3% drop. If it breaks at 92.16 ish, then expect a drop to 89.18 ish. If it breaks at 93.51 ish, then expect a drop to 90.59 ish. If it breaks at around 95 ish, then expect a drop to 91 ish.
* 89p, 90p, 91p 12/4 will be the plays, depending on where or if AMD drops out of its uptrend channel.
* Trim and leave runner at price target or bottoms. I don't think we drop lower than 87.18 tomorrow, but leave a runner for the lotto in case we do.

TSLA Plays for 12/1:

* I'm expecting TSLA to close around 605-617 ish so keep the 620c 12/11 that I told you to buy.
* If TSLA holds current support, look for 605c 12/4. Trim at the target or at top and leave a runner for 617+
* The line in the sand is really 593.43 IMO.
* TSLA could bounce off 605 ish if it makes it and drop to 588 ish and below. Scalping a 585p or 580p might be worthwhile. Trim and leave a runner for 576 ish and below.
* If current support fails, look for 588, 580, and 576 price targets. It TSLA breaks through 576.90 ish then expect it to fall near 552 ish IMO. 552 ish is danger zone for TSLA so be careful if it gets there.

We just had a Luckin Coffee EV Situation,0.59,"So it's an overall red day, for sure. I personally like NIO a lot and don't think you have to fear for it, but when I first invested in it a while ago one of the first things I thought about was Luckin coffee (was not invested in it but that was a train wreck after the news).

Well, there's some alleged news that KNDI, (Kandi Technologies) an EV and battery manufacturer was falsifying their revenue with fake accounts.

The stock has thus far dropped 35% today, nearly hitting a record, and proceeds to drop as we speak. And while I think NIO and XPEV are good stocks, there is always that dark side that we might not know about, and if we do - it's too late. So, I guess word of caution, let's try our best to stick to US stocks and at the very least if we lose money somewhat support the bozos on our end of the spectrum, because generally we at least know they're doing something.

"TSLA- buy the rumour, sell the news(remeber)",0.75,"Ok, so TSLA will be included in S&P 500 in Dec 21. Old news. Around $100B(almost 1/5th of its market cap) of TSLA would need to be purchased(some active funds may have already purchased) based on current stock price.

The only reason I have been holding TSLA after it split is the whole S&P 500 inclusion thingy. After that, I don't know what will even move this stock. They freakin surpassed Bekshire and could surpass Facebook(for a short time)!!!

Today they will announce whether to include TSLA in two sessions or in one session.

[This is what happened when Yahoo was included\(which is comparable to TSLA's inclusion as they have had relatively comparable size in comparison to S&P 500's size\)](https://preview.redd.it/czcweg5oeb261.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de2ff9033b37cd1051703ffffb7c47fafa1f7444)

After the trading sessions, expect a big dip. As a lot of speculators this year have bought into TSLA precisely to f\*\*k the index investors.

Also the trade date Dec. 18, coincides with a once-quarterly event known as quadruple witching, the Friday near the end of each calendar quarter on which options and futures on both indexes and stocks expire simultaneously. Volume is usually heavy on those days and would help boost liquidity on the day of Tesla‚Äôs inclusion, investors said.(this paragraph copied straight from wsj)

So, I guess don't be a fool(unless there are some tax implications, which I don't have); buy the rumour, sell the news. TSLA will completely tank after the inclusion.

Also, remember NIO, XPEV etc kind of benefit from the TSLA hype, so be very careful you all about them.

I don't think if you don't have any immediate tax implications, there wouldn't be much value holding TSLA for the longer term as there are better long term plays. And when or if TSLA reaches $700 or higher(I know I am very bullish, but that's why I am a retard) there would be almost no point in holding it any longer.",2020-11-30 05:59:26

Delisting of Chinese Stocks & What You Should Know,0.82,"I see a lot of misinformation going on around here regarding the bill that is to pass. I am going to try and clear that up.

BABA, NIO, etc. are currently audited by PwC China. This in itself **does not mean** that they are automatically okay. PwC Canada, PwC America, etc. are all subject to audits from the PCAOB. PwC China's government officials have, **to this day**, not allowed the PCAOB to conduct an audit investigation into PwC China, their audit procedures/protocols, etc. As a result, **the PCAOB does not have reasonable assurance** that PwC China is conducting their audits in accordance with U.S. regulations.

Don't believe me? Read BABA's annual reports where they state this:

*PricewaterhouseCoopers, our auditor, is required under U.S. law to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB. However, without approval from the Chinese government authorities, the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections of the audit work and practices of PCAOB-registered audit firms within the PRC on a basis comparable to other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Since we have substantial operations in the PRC, our auditor and its audit work are currently not fully inspected by the PCAOB.*

This is **not just an issue of BABA, NIO, etc. complying with U.S. GAAP**. If anything, BABA, NIO, etc. would pay the higher accounting fees to be in accordance with U.S. regulations/GAAP. **The issue is between PCAOB and PwC China/Chinese government officials who are disallowing the PCAOB from conducting their normal investigations/audits on auditing firms**.

This bill will put pressure on them to begin allowing public sector audits, but if China continues to resist, BABA, NIO, etc. will **not** be safe.",2020-11-30 00:05:23

From my analysis ( and I can I be wrong but statistically speaking I‚Äôm probably not ) . So from the graph we can see that there are 8 closures greater than the maximum of the second that precedes, and in simple words it means that in about 2 weeks there‚Äôs a high chance that NIO is going to sell off massively. That doesn‚Äôt mean that you can‚Äôt keep making money off NIO for the following week but from then, it‚Äôs going to be rough.

There is a chance that nothing of what I said is going to happen.

Just look at last weeks pumps.... NIO, BLNK, SOLO, XPEV....  


But where are the posts now?  Nowhere to be found.... but people still own them.   Baggie bagholders.

So, take that knowledge that there are weak hands holding unloved stocks, hoping that someone takes them out higher.  Take the other side.  Use gamma in your favor on the downside.   Market makers are hedged with stock because of your CALL buying.   That gamma will reverse with PUT buying.    They'll need to sell stock and your PUTs will moon.

Just remember that when you degenerates move on from PLTR, you can make money as the light dims and the pump fades.

Link to live chart so you don't have to lift a finger: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/NgDefEcF/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/NgDefEcF/)

If SPY holds support, look for a 363c, 364c, or 365c 0dte. 365c will be the lotto IMO, just in case it breaks out of the rising wedge. Look for a price target of about 365.14. If SPY holds support, the first test will be 364.71 ish if she gets there. You may want to trim and leave a runner you so won‚Äôt have to beg for money in the Wendy‚Äôs parking lot.

If current support fails, look out for 361-360 and below for PUTS to print.

**11/26 SPY Recap**

SPY must have overeaten during Thanksgiving because it was sluggish on Friday (11/26). SPY fell out of its uptrend channel around 9:30 AM ish MST and dipped to its low point of the day, 362.58, before quickly rebounding. SPY reached a high of 364.18 and closed at 363.67.

[15m chart](https://preview.redd.it/e4ge9fwnl7261.png?width=2172&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ab5da8a655f9f863a015293dfd4a043fcf29111)

SPY has been consolidating since 11/24 midday. It is currently at the top of its consolidation rectangle, as highlighted below. We shall see if SPY can break out on Monday or if it will bounce off resistance and head back down to 361 ish and below. We could have one more day of consolidation, based on past charting.

[30m chart](https://preview.redd.it/k1dct1fyl7261.png?width=2226&format=png&auto=webp&s=868e9285d8a2b311db1ac386cda29c6b363b9939)

From 11/25 Recap: ‚ÄúSPY consolidated from 11/9 - 11/13 before breaking out 1.5%. She consolidated for about 2 days and 9 hours, from 11/13 - 11/17 (over the weekend). However, after consolidating, SPY fell about 1.14%. After the fall, SPY consolidated for about 5 days and 17 hours from 11/18 - 11/24 (over the weekend). Spy jumped about 1.46% before the current consolidation channel.‚Äù

&#x200B;

Monday will be the start of SPY‚Äôs 4th day of consolidation, so something has to give IMO, but she could consolidate on Monday, so watch out for pump fakes. You may want to extend the consolidation channel to be safe. However, if SPY breaks out, expect a 1-2% movement in either direction, as highlighted below.

[30m chart](https://preview.redd.it/020y89jnm7261.png?width=2170&format=png&auto=webp&s=d438b4dfe8d9db618a865fea7f284fef6bc5ab3b)

As stated in an earlier analysis, I'm bullish on SPY if it stays above 358 ish. SPY continues to toy around with a w-shaped recovery as highlighted below. On the daily chart, I'm looking for PSY to break through resistance and find new support. If support looks healthy, you could sell your wife's wedding ring and look at a late Dec. 380c. lotto.

**11/30 - 12/28 AMD Possibilities or Is AMD on Santa‚Äôs Nice List?**

* If AMD punches through 87.18 resistance finds and news support, you could look at a 90c exp. 12/11 and hope that it hits between 90-93.2+ and trim. Maybe even leave a runner for a lotto.
* If AMD bounces around that price point, you could look at scalping an 87p and trim at that price point, leaving a runner if she breaks to 85-83.
* If AMD finds support at around 87.18 and bounces, you could look for another 90-92c weekly. At that time, you could dump all your savings and play a late December lotto 98c like to true degen that you are.

**11/30 - 12/3 TSLA TA or When Will TSLA slow down?**

* If TSLA holds current support, you could look at scalping a 610c 12/4 exp and trim around top or 612-619 and leave a lotto runner.
* If TSLA breaks support, you could scalp a 575p 12/4 exp. and trim at bottom or around 567.72, leaving a lotto runner for 554.55 and below.
* If TLA holds support on uptrend on monday or Tuesday, you could dumpo your entire life savings into a 620c 12/11 and watch TSLA hitt 700.

**11/30 - 12/7 NIO Possibilities or Don't Forget About NIO WSB**

* If NIO holds current support you could look at scalping 56c 12/4 exp. and trim at around that price point, leaving a runner for 59.77 and above.
* If support fails, you could scalp a 52p 12/4 exp. and rim at bottom or around that price point and leave a runner for 47.25 and below.
* If NIO drops to 52.53 ish and finds strong support you could dump your entire life savings and second mortgage into a 61c 12/11 lotto and take the non-stop train to tendie town.

Is the WallStreetBets sub-reddit fools gold or are we a diamond in the rough? I think the latter,0.97,"They always make fun of us ~~traders~~ gamblers here at r/WallStreetBets, but who \*really\* has the last laugh? Is it us Chads while we eat our crayons on the way to the Lambo shop? Or are the virgin traders truly better than us?

I'm going to show you something. Something that's never been seen by human eyes, never computed by any type of algorithm, something our wive's boyfriends wouldn't even pay attention to. This is the WallStreetBets sentiment and hype detection.

I've come to the conclusion that WallStreetBets is #1 when it comes to finding trends and finding stocks. It doesn't matter if this is after-the-fact that the stock price shot up 50% in 2 days. It doesn't matter that the stock is something nobody paid attention to until finally the whole world start trading it (PLTR). What it comes down to is the fact that WSB will find literally any stock after it has already mooned. Stock up 10% for the day? WSB knows about it. Stock up 20% in the last week? WSB has already traded it. It's genius.

**Here's the kicker**. \*Most\* times after a stock has mooned once and WSB hops on the trend, the stock will go through another 1 or 2 periods of ""mooning"". If you are new to the industry of printing tendies, grab a tequila on the rocks and have a drink with me while I go through some sentiment on the WallStreetBets forum.

&#x200B;

I'm not even going to start with PLTR (Palantir) because that would be too obvious. Let's start with XPEV.

&#x200B;

**XPEV**

Look at this sentiment chart. The stock wasn't even mentioned a single time until some autist found an alternative EV company to gamble on after it shot up 10% in a single day.

https://preview.redd.it/un64jt1z47261.png?width=1608&format=png&auto=webp&s=311103e4373fa04790226cebe751d1d35ca9aa9b

1st wave sentiment peaked at 3% of the sub-reddit's comment volume. What happened next? The stock stayed flat for 7 days and you autists completely forgot about it. Next stop - Wave 2: Comment volume peaking at roughly 5% of all comments after the stock price went from $33 to $43 in one day. Massive spike in chatter around the ticker and the stock price continues it's meteoric climb for a whole month. You can see another 1 or 2 waves where sentiment rises after big moves in stock prices.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**CRSR**

https://preview.redd.it/0scjg83257261.png?width=1612&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbaca71ea742ea0c1431dde33304aa009c277ba8

Next up is Corsair Gaming. None of you autists even knew the stock existed 2 months ago. We can see wave 1 happened early November with small gains in the stock price. Sentiment was steady as autists everywhere were drooling over consistent gains for the first time, loving every minute of it, kind of like when you kiss your cousin for the first time. Wasn't long after we see wave 2 and 3 of the trend where the stock continues it's mission to Mars.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**LI** 

https://preview.redd.it/alxnfwz257261.png?width=1612&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c9ebd19dec396d22ad8146e8fb1732277cd10e0

Next we'll look at LI. 99% of you, including myself, don't even know what this company does. All we know is that STOCKS ONLY GO UP. The first wave happened 3 weeks ago when comment volume reached 5% of all the comments on the sub-reddit. Stock price shot up 30% in a single day. Sounds insane that the momentum would continue upward, but it has. Not only that, the stock price has gone up another 30% in the last 3 weeks.

&#x200B;

**PLTR**

https://preview.redd.it/vs5zaon357261.png?width=1630&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f6c883545d1bf1b550890d7c4ad4518dafdde02

The PLTR sentiment chart is nothing short of magnificent for a sentiment junkie like myself. Comment volume has been rising at the same rate as the stock price. On Friday roughly 50% of discussion comments mentioned the ticker PLTR. Something that you either loved or found incredibly annoying. The only other tickers to ever break the 50% comment volume barrier are Tesla and NIO.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

What's the next meme stock going to be? Is it GME? Do we regress back to PRPL gang? Nobody really knows, but one thing I can agree with is that wave 1 of the trend is almost always the early adopters with gorilla balls willing to risk large amounts of capital on a stock nobody's ever traded before. Once a few believers hop on the train the whole sub-reddit jumps on the bandwagon headed to hell or Valhalla.",2020-11-29 15:21:30

ZoomInfo to the moon or is it doomed?,0.78,"So lockup period for ZoomInfo ends on Monday. I saw some retard say that we should short the shit out of this because all the paper hands investor pussies at the big banks are gonna sell and take profits. 

I went back and tracked the movements of the last 10 stocks that had their lock up period end. None of them showed any significant decline on the day of the lockup ending, maybe 1-4% movements, and the bigger ones are considering that you got in at the very top and sold at the very bottom. None of them also showed any significant tendency to decline, and either continued an existing uptrend or traded sideways. 

Hence, why the fuck would I short this thing? If any of you retards knows something that I don't, do enlighten me with your autism.

Positions: NIO stock, bought at $50, FTEK, DPW, PLTR

Edit: Okay you spastic dumbasses, I didn't realise that you idiots need so much evidence. Some guy comes on here screaming 'BUY PLTR' and you fucks rush in and buy, and I'm out here trying to make a discussion and getting shit on. 

Here is the site that I used to get the stocks that were about to have their lockup period end:

https://www.marketbeat.com/ipos/lockup-expirations/

Start with Inari, work backwards 10 times. All these stocks did not move a significant amount upon lockup expiration. Don't take my 'lying' word for it, check it yourself. 

It even tells you on the site that you can expect a '1-3%' decline in the share price. 

Now, if you are happy with 1-3% moves, by all means please go for it. But for most of you on the sub reddit, this is not an option since you all look for meme stocks that move 10-20%, if not more, in a day. I'm one of you retards, hence I was looking for a bigger move.",2020-11-29 10:24:30

The same problem is happening now, people invest in actually profitable companies like Google, Facebook and Tesla but more and more people are getting anxious about missing out (PLTR cough cough) that they invest into any FinTech, EV, and Digital company just because the CEO said they will grow. Keep in mind that NIO is more overvalued than TSLA and yet TSLA still has bigger potential than NIO, just like Apple is adopting USB Type-C, so can Tesla adopt replaceable batteries if they're proven successful by NIO except the market will already be made ready for it by NIO.

Analysis on the American legislation on Chinese companies (BABA etc.),0.92,"The legislation, if it becomes law, would give Chinese companies and their auditors three years to comply with inspection requirements before they could be kicked off the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Stock Market.""

1. Three years to comply (NIO will NOT be AFFECTED, see link in EDIT (they are already compliant). 

2. These companies are already audited by American Big 4 firms in their local Chinese counterparts, for example NIO is audited by PWC China, just like a Canadian company is audited by PWC Canada and so on.

3. It's a huge investment market for American fund managers and investment banks as ""More than 170 companies based in China or Hong Kong have completed IPOs in the U.S. since January 2014, raising about $58.7 billion."" This is not something institutions want to see vaporize as China is a massive market for unique investment opportunities and with a rising middle class will continue to grow.

4. These companies would need to simply switch some standards from IFRS which is used outside of the United States to the U.S GAAP accounting method, and allow for audits in their financial statements based on U.S GAAP. This procedure would incur higher cost for these firms, but given three years it is relatively simple to do.

5. Pressure from China, or other people within Biden's new cabinet and the new adminstration in general may overturn this rule. (However this is doubtful). But this may force China to negotiate a deal between the countries regarding these requirements and extending the timeline and softening the rules.

6. This is not something you need to worry about right NOW. Wait for the bill to be passed, see what the response from the companies CEO is and the path to allow for this switch to the U.S system, they have 3 years after all.

EDIT: Provided an additional link on NIO displaying that NIO is included in the PCAOB and will not need to worry about this law as they are already compliant. https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Chinese%20Companies%20on%20U.S.%20Stock%20Exchanges.pdf",2020-11-28 20:47:49

What do they do?

To introduce them and what they do i'll link you this video

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFaWb0aUjPk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFaWb0aUjPk)

If you're too lazy to watch it, they are the first to make 3D printers which can produce electronics. Not a difficult concept to wrap your head around. They're on track to revolutionize the manufacturing process for electronics.

\_\_\_

Demand:

Their product is another company's capital. They make it easier and faster for other companies to make money so there will always be demand for their products. From big corporations at that. They have already worked with the US army, and leading PCB Technology companies.

They customer base extends from big corporations in need of capital. NNDM technologies also benefit educational institutions. Yeah it's nice for the youth of the world to learn more about technology but lets be honest. Colleges are the biggest scams in America, they have money to spend from squeezing 50k+ from every single one of their students. When this company starts running, colleges are gonna want in on the action.

They have already sold one of their printers to a University in Hong Kong

Added note: They have customers all around the world.

Investors:

I'm not just one retard trying to sell this company to other retards. Big name investors see their potential too.

Cathy Woods (Who invested in Tesla before they were big) Chief investor of ARK Invest has been consistently buying large sums of shares during the following weeks. It holds the 23rd position in their ARKQ ETF among other big names like Tesla and Apple.

\_\_\_

Finances:

This is the ugly side of things. This company is not YET profitable, and probably wont be for a while. 3D printers are expensive. HOWEVER, as stated, big name investors are putting money into them to keep them alive and growing.

While they're not profitable, they have cash and utilize financial instruments to their advantage.

They have used direct offerings to steadily give investors opportunities to support their business and eat up more shares of their company. The last direct offering dropped the stock's price down significantly which is understandable because they offered the shares at $4. However, it did not take long for the stock's price to sky rocket shortly after big name investors bought up those shares. This is predicted to happen again. It has plenty of room to run until then. and if you're following the ticker, you'll be able to capitalize on the next direct offering and grab shares at a huge discount.

The price usually goes up after a direct offering.

Nano Dimensions isn't profitable but have plenty of investors who believe in them to support them until they are.

WARNING: THE PRICE WILL DIP ONCE THE DIRECT OFFERING HAPPENS. This is HEALTHY for the stock and will help it grow. It's not expected to happen for a month but NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHEN. Be wary of how much money you put in before the direct offering.

How to ride momentum/meme stocks like PLTR/NIO/CRSR (and soon GME) without getting burned.,0.88,"Quick disclaimer, this isn't the only way, and it doesn't work if you buy at the top (obviously).  But I believe this is one of the better methods for maximizing returns while ensuring you don't get screwed when the train stops and the stock dumps 25% in a day.

Essentially what you do, is you buy a few slightly OTM calls dated at least 3-4 weeks out on a stock in meme status.  Sit on them until they go ITM and the value goes up substantially and then sell it, converting it into two new OTM calls for a similar distance out. The other important aspect is that there is leftover money after purchasing the two replacement calls.

Example, in CRSR I bought a feb call for 4, sold it for 17 and bought two new feb calls for 5 each.  This way, I was able to increase my call position, while recovering my initial investment and locking in 300 dollars in profit. I did this 3 times while it moved from 23 to 53.  Now, I have a much larger position in CRSR than I started with in terms of money/calls, but even if those become worthless, I still made a lot of money on the stock (this was all with slightly otm stocks, but further otm would work as well).  It removes the need to time the top and bottom etc.  As long as you get in early enough to do one flip, you make a profit

&#x200B;

Again, this won't work as well for normal stock movements, but for these massive meme stocks it is a killer strategy.  It is especially important for GME, where it is poised to have the largest short squeeze in history with 125% of float shorted during a time where fomo is probably as high as any time in history.  We could squeeze to 40, or 400....no one really has any clue.  Once the squeeze ends, I would assume the stock price will dump back into the 30s.  Having a way to avoid having to sell at that point is important, and averaging out as it goes up runs the risk of missing out on massive profits. If someone else has a better strat, I'd love to hear it!

&#x200B;

Please ask questions here, I'm happy to help, but I can't handle the number of DMs I've been getting lately, and I PROMISE someone else has the same question you do and would benefit from it being in the thread.

For those asking - current positions (not showing my 1500 shares) and a brief explanation of my short term plan IF GME doesn't start squeezing before ER. This changes to the above strategy as soon as the squeeze kicks off.  [https://imgur.com/6Onvz7I](https://imgur.com/6Onvz7I)",2020-11-28 19:03:57

The Phases of WSB Meme Stocks,0.86,"Buy PLTR shares, hold for at least a month- this is ‚Äúphase 3‚Äù of WSB.  Rational people think it can‚Äôt double AGAIN, idiots don‚Äôt know when to stop making memes & pushing it with unconditional faith of it hitting 1,000% gains, and retards make the profits. 


See NIO- NIO‚Äôs ‚Äúphase 3‚Äù happened around the $26-$35 range.  Solid increase from there.  
See GME- their phase 3 happened around the $11 mark- now up to $16.  


Phase 1: WSB mentions a stock in DD and someone makes a meme about it, but 95% don‚Äôt have a clue about the company, but enjoy the hype. 


Phase 2: The stock makes more than 50% gains, and it officially becomes a ‚Äúmeme‚Äù stock.  95% of people still don‚Äôt know much about it, but Google the ticker.  And watch a few memes. This is where normal people think that there will be a pullback from a 50-100% gain & don‚Äôt jump on board.  Retards jump all in and see another 50% gain.  


Phase 3:  contention.  At this point, the stock has at least doubled, probably tripled since its first meme.  There is some profit taking, maybe a pullback (10-25%) but the memes don‚Äôt stop.  It get good coverage, it gets bad coverage, but all attention is good.  Can last for 1 day to 2 weeks. Then resumes at least a 30% gain from its last high.  Real wall street is forced to enter real positions in it.  


Phase 4:  Latency. Big money bought in high, refuses to sell and be the bag holder, just waits for the next round of hype to take gains, or ride higher.  (NIO is here, GME is here with the short squeeze).

It's big ass respected company founded in 2003 and went in a direct public offering¬†on September 30, 2020. Citrons decision to issue a $20 target EOY makes sence because the lockup period ends, which means that early investors will then be free to release some of their stock that they got in a single digits and sell in a open market. If we talk about right now, the momentum is insane, which means there is still alot of space to grow until EOY, wouldn't even be suprised if we touch $50. If we talk about future years, PLTR will be huge, and even these 30, 40, 50 will look cheap AF. I just wanted to tell you that you should fucking wake up and realise how big this shit is and will be even bigger! If you are ready to let time do it's work just fucking buy these shares. NIO was $3 earlier this year, doesn't that sound like a FUCKING CHEAP price right now? Back then it didn't look that cheap.

"Flip side: Citron is right a lot, too...",0.68,"Since there's a lot of newer ~~gamblers~~ investors on WSB, there's been a lot of anger directed at Citron research for a tweet that probably cost 90% of WSB their portfolio cause they bought 11/27 PLTR calls. An expensive lesson in buying 0/1/2 DTE options.

There was a post that was, well...a ""cope"" post which was painting Citron as essentially always being wrong. ""What about NIO!!"" - yes, they got that wrong. But there's multiple stocks they've covered that dropped 90%+, including a Pharmaceutical GIANT (Valeant Pharma). They're right a lot more than they are wrong. Do your own DD [here](https://citronresearch.com/category/citron_reports/page/2/) (archive of the reports they've posted). I looked through some of their bearish calls, and here's a small list.

PLTR may well recover and go to 50+, or it may continue to drop to $20. The point of this post is to provide the other side of the coin - Citron gets it right a lot. Do they get some wrong too? Sure, but for the newer 'investors' that haven't been in the game for a long time, there's a reason a simple tweet from Citron can cause a stock to go from +26% to -4% in a shortened trading day.

"It isnt a meme, its a solid play. Gamestop is a once in a lifetime >3000% return opportunity.",0.94,"**READ THIS RETARDS. SHORT SQUEEZE MEANS MORE RETURNS THAN PLTR, NIO, XPEV, EVERY MEME STOCK COMBINED. GME** üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

&#x200B;

**Squeeze?**

Its gotten to the point where short interest is over 100%, meaning that more than 100% of the available shares of gamestop have been shorted. How does this happen? Shares can be borrowed, sold, then borrowed from the buyer (making two people technically borrowing the same 1 share). This is insane and has never happened before without causing a short squeeze. (look up volkswagen short squeeze chart to see what it looks like when short interest exceeds 100%).

[https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME\/key-statistics?p=GME](https://preview.redd.it/n8sr8ifnww161.png?width=840&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3f3ef131a7d5bdee19acd4c6bd8196fad9c66aa)

So if gamestop stock goes up, the shorts will have to cover, which is literally impossible since theyve shorted over 100% of shares, so the price will be driven to an absolute retard height. But, whats gonna make gamestop go up? how are the shorts wrong?

**Consoles**

Well, the obvious is console sales, but thats not really it. Yes, the consoles will help, however more importantly there are key indicators that gamestop is not going bankrupt. Recently, they just paid off a metric fuckton of debt *voluntarily* which means they have the cash to do that, aka not bankrupt. People are literally camping out at gamestop for consoles. They will not struggle.

**Cohen**

Also, they are getting the help from ryan cohen, who successfully competed with amazon by launching an online pet store called Chewy, which made him a billionaire. This is good news for gamestop because he will help pivot them from brick and mortar towards a more digital world, which means gamestop now has realistic growth prospects. Also, there is rumors that cohen will announce a tender offer, which would immediately trigger a short squeeze, end of story. Cohen has openly critiqued the BoD about their '20th century mindset' so it is likely he is going to take over soon.

&#x200B;

[Also, massive completely random spikes in volume off seemingly no news indicate that cohen is buying up shares. ](https://preview.redd.it/e19xcu0qxw161.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=81f7c9aeb4df33cc2d416f7fda3b2e8ee257cc43)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Positioning**

They have also positioned themselves to benefit from non traditional 'brick and mortar' revenue streams. Another thing that gamestop has is online revenue sharing with sony, which means they will be benefiting from digital game sales. They also just announced that they would be selling TVs on their website, showing that they are positioning themselves to compete as an online retailer.

\^Link about TVs.

**The move:**

Buy as many shares as you can and hold. Set a limit sell on all your shares for at least $500, to make sure that you dont miss the squeeze. That alone would be a 3,233% gain.

Important note: This quarters earnings will likely not be a catalyst for a short squeeze. It is likely that there will be a run up and then small dump after. Remember, the shorts are working hard to fuck over longs. Dont be a retard and fall for it. Buy up the dips.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TLDR: BUY GAMESTOP SHARES, HOLD WITH A LIMIT SELL OF AT LEAST $500/share**

Now, How to fight the boomers and the MM?

1. Stop yoloing your entire bankroll into one position

2. Buy in portions (smaller % of your bankroll) during DIPs if you going to buy at the top I'd suggest buying at least 1-2months out of expiration and get ready to ride through the next DIP. (Also lower your strike and longer dates as you keep buying, don't keep buying the same strike/expiration)

3. Since you have been buying steadily at different levels, you can have set target for each buys depending on your risk tolerance, hence stagger your profit taking.

I'm not your financial advisor nor I am telling you to buy anything, but instead of yoloing everything with one bullet, reduce your risk and stay in the game for the long fight.

Bill Gates has invested $500 million of his own monies into this company and it is also backed by Tesla co-founder JB Staubel. They plan to install these batteries in VW's by 2025. This is quite possibly the battery company that makes mass EV transition a reality.

A calm explanation of PLTRs price action today,0.96,"1. Citron Research declared a short with a price target of $20. Although they didn‚Äôt give any fundamental reasoning behind their short(other than saying it‚Äôs a casino, whatever that means), this inevitably lead to some traders selling their stocks to secure profits.
Citron has been proven wrong almost all of the times. Very recently with NIO. But also with TSLA, SHOP etc.

2. Traders securing profits. Some traders don't like to hold over the weekends and given that PLTR has runup so much in this week, it is very natural for them to secure profits.

3. Healthy correction. This is pretty obvious. As much as the sub likes to pump this stock. Without a healthy correction, a stock will not really moon. AAPL, AMZN, TSLA etc all saw their corrections in their days.

4. Shorter trading day and being the day after thanksgiving. This is an anecdotal reason, but generally there has been a pattern of correction in this day.

That's all there is really. Even if there was no reason, you should all have expected a pullback after such a huge runup.
Saying that it will go to moon without some bumps would be obviously acting like a shill.

Though I must say there is one note of caution in the options market. The numbers are not really in favour of options buyer any more in this stock.

I would recommend buying PLTR shares directly or selling puts FOR NOW.",2020-11-27 18:09:43
PLTR red day,0.8,"Guys chill, it dropped a buck, even after a Citron short. Theres no reason for shares to go to 20$. He pulled the number out of his ass. Unlike NIO, he didnt write a paper or anything to justify why he has a short target of 20$. There's still plenty of room for PLTR to grow, play long shares or leaps. Weeklies are, and always have been, risky.",2020-11-27 18:07:37
Reminder about CITRON for PLTR holders,0.87,"If you haven't heard yet, Andrew Left of Citron Research tweeted about PLTR this morning and is likely the cause of the downturn today.

He pulled a nearly identical move a few weeks ago with NIO. Conspicuously, he made both of these tweets on a Friday. My suspicion is that he does this to tank a stock on a day where he can benefit from 0DTE puts, whether he's buying them or others working for him are doing so.

Less time value = cheaper contracts.

For everyone thinking the PLTR party is over, don't lose hope yet. Just like with NIO, Left is likely publishing these hit pieces to create a short term opportunity.",2020-11-27 18:05:05
"Citron shorted $NIO on 11/13, and the stock fell 14% in a day.

The next week, $NIO posted a 20% gain, rising from $41.12 to $49.25. Then the week after that, $NIO recovered from it's dip and reached its ATH (today).

Best way to donate to charity: shares not cash!,0.95,"Let‚Äôs all make the most of our donations this holiday season. The best way to donate to charity is to send them your best performing shares of stock. That way you don‚Äôt pay taxes on any of your gains, and the charity is allowed to sell the stock immediately upon receipt and they don‚Äôt pay any taxes either. 

Steps to do this: 
1.	Find the charity‚Äôs brokerage account information online or send them a message asking for it. The instructions should include information to perform a Depository Trust Corporation (DTC) transfer 
2.	Call your broker or send them a secure message online to provide them with the DTC instructions, including the ticker symbol, number of shares, and specifically which shares or all shares of a stock holding that you‚Äôre looking to donate
3.	Your brokerage will take a few hours up to a few days, and the shares will disappear from your account. The charity will then send you a receipt for the entire value of shares that you sent them, which is tax deductible against the rest of your tendies for the year

Example scenario:
I bought $2k shares of NIO that are up 200%. I donated the $6k of stock to charity, so instead of having to pay taxes on $4k in gains I instead get to deduct the entire $6k on my taxes.

Example of a few DTC instructions for charities:

1.	Food bank example since it‚Äôs the holidays/Thanksgiving - Food Bank of Silicon Valley: https://www.shfb.org/give-help/stock-gifts/
2.	The founder of the ice bucket challenge passed away last weekend, so you could also give to ALS research (Lou Gehrig‚Äôs disease). This is a disease that has personally impacted my family as well: https://www.als.org/get-involved/ways-give/information-securities-brokers

Caveats: 
1.	Some of the newer, smaller brokers might not be setup to donate shares via DTC, so you‚Äôll have to check with your broker to see if it will work. All of the traditional brokers like eTrade, Fidelity, etc are setup to handle this process
2.	Options are not a good idea to send because of the potential volatility and liquidity that is forced upon the charity. So more liquid, straightforward instruments like regular common stock such has PLTR, NIO, GME is the best way to donate

 PS. The ultimate charitable gift is to buy more shares of PLTR to raise all of WSB out of poverty

Edit: looks like it‚Äôs also better if you‚Äôve owned the shares for more than a year. Otherwise you can only deduct your cost basis, but you still get to avoid paying taxes on the gains either way.

A hidden gem from Europe if you wanna play during thanksgiving $MCPHY,0.82,"I guess everyone already have some stocks of TSLA and NIO. What about an equivalent in Europe ?

A new company just get inside the MSCI Smallcaps Index, and this is Mcphy Energy (MCPHY).

McPhy Energy specialises in the manufacture and marketing of equipment for the production and storage of hydrogen in solid form from the electrolysis of water. The group offers electrolysers, storage containers and integrated solutions for the energy, industry and transport sectors. The company has 3 production site in Germany, France and Italy.

&#x200B;

1. Numbers :

I have not carried out a very thorough fundamental analysis knowing in advance that, although the company is almost 12 years old, it still has a start-up model and that the sector, although growing rapidly, is still not very profitable. A basic comparison with its two major competitors may simply suggest that it has room for improvement:

Nel ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ITM Power ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† McPhycapi M‚Ç¨¬† ¬† 1300¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 500¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 100CA M‚Ç¨¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 47¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 15¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 11

Its 2019 revenues are up 43% to ‚Ç¨11.4 million compared with ‚Ç¨8 million in 2018. It has strengthened its shareholders' equity and has a cash position of ‚Ç¨13 million at 31 December 2019, notably following the success of the capital increase by private placement carried out last November.

&#x200B;

2) Strategically :

McPhy has chosen alkaline technology for its electrolysers, which is older and slightly less efficient than the PEM technology with Proton Exchange Membrane chosen by ITM Power, but less expensive and therefore more immediately profitable for the customer.

On the other hand, McPhy had originally built its model on its proprietary solid hydrogen storage technology. However, this technology has not been commercially convincing in 10 years (PoliticalAnimal had already pointed out 4 years ago the fragility of this model in the face of the number of alternative solutions in the McPhy queue). They have therefore finally chosen to abandon this path in December 2018 and concentrate on electrolysis. The good results of 2019 (a year of transition, therefore) are undoubtedly in large part due to this change of strategy and bode well for 2020.

3) Last news :

McPhy Energy announced in October the launch of a ‚Ç¨150 million capital increase. A lightning operation, completed during the night, the amount of which has moreover been increased to 180 million euros. The operation was reserved for major investors

&#x200B;

I think to invest in ITM Power (ITM) could be a good idea the price is still really low.

How to invest - from a seasoned investor,0.96,"
I wasn‚Äôt sure to post this in r/stocks or here, but here we go. Here‚Äôs how you need to start investing:
1. Click that buy button for PLTR, NIO, and XPEV
2. Watch your profits go up as you slap your dick against the wall like the autistic bastard you are
3. Watch that one stupid retard eat his own damn shit


Cheers to your new life and greater profits,

FSR building strong momentum (ALERT),0.62,FSR is postulating in a way similar to NIO before NIO broke out. After clearing its latest hurdle of the 17s in to the early 20s it has no reason to not continue driving in a manner similar to the lengthened drive we saw on Wednesday from PLTR. Calls are also unbelievably still cheap for the potential spurt we‚Äôre about to see.,2020-11-26 14:32:18

Doesn‚Äôt matter if your business is war or pharmaceuticals.  Now that you can see it, it still makes no fucking sense. That‚Äôs why Palantir also provides you with NIO (Not the EV car company, but a personal user interface designed by an on site field engineer) who will build you your own custom answer station. Where is your business wasteful? Where you can be more profitable and successful?

Georgia runoff e!ection is gonna rip our dicks off pt. 2,0.65,"follow up to [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jq2901/georgia_runoff_eection_is_gonna_rip_our_dicks_off/). The main premise is that if senate goes blue in georgia, we're gonna run out of lube by the time the drop is over. If you check out the upside, I was right, but I was wrong in terms of the downside. Hopefully, you got in on the upside thesis. 

let's see what has happened since the last post:

- vaccine (irrelevant for this thesis, it only shifts the starting point of the crash upwards)

- yellen (inflation goes up, that's about it)

- biden seems to be shilling for corporate america still, which is a plus for republicans, but he has stated he'll campaign in georgia (my guess is that he's just saving face on this as he's pro stonks)

- the media has been disparaging towards the dem candidates, but super supportive toward the republican candidates (not surprising, they may have political biases, but b o g d a n o f f will clap their cheeks if their politics hurts stonk tendies)

- we've had an enormous run in stonks and the coin, so it's time for bad news to have a larger than life impact. E.G. nio is flagging

- no viral e!ection campaigns from ossoff have been started that I have noticed. His politics are pretty mundane, and his attacks don't really bite. He did see some viral attention when he requested a debate with perdue and pussdue pussied out. However, the MSM really dampened the virality of this event.

- trump acting like a tard, really not helping perdue


- covid ramping up again, might kill off some of the republican boomers that voted in person for trump, or at least give em a wake up call


update on data:

[These guys are usually tards, so I wouldn't put much faith in them, but it looks like ossoff is even with perdue](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/georgia/). I'm not even gonna consider laughler, there is no way that thot is winning.



If we look at vote counting:

2,462,617 for david tendie

2,374,519 for jon ostrich


871970 mail in ballots for ostrich

Just got word that ""762,000 absentee ballots have already been requested in the Peach State"".

I don't know about you retards, but I'm willing to bet that the majority of these initial 762000 absentee ballots are the same folks from that 871970 figure for ostrich. If ostrich just needs an additional 200k to beat out perdue, and the majority of those absentee ballots are dem, then if ostrich gets 300k more absentee ballots over the next month, perdue is practically fucked, because as I show in my previous post, it's likely that young voters will gotv in bulk on top of these absentee numbers as well. This is assuming that the in person voting ratios remain constant.


Timeline:

December 19 is when absentee ballots close for georgia. The hedge funds will most likely learn about these numbers ahead of time, so I'm guessing we're gonna see things start to get sour in a way that coincides with covid fud, so likely Dec 7 is when you should start considering selling for tax gains on anything outside of the upside plays that involve blue wave legislation. If the absentee numbers look bad on december 19, I'm getting the fuck out before the slow funds start selling off for end of month

Hope this helps, if you see anything that's wrong speak up to help autists make tendies


edit: also, just to keep in mind, upside might get fucked if the numbers start looking heavily republican, because probably a lot of the other autists out there were thinking along the same lines when I made the first post, and if the assumptions change, then people will start pulling out",2020-11-26 03:26:47
Fuck y'all and also I love you (first post),0.98,"(Repost bc automod got mad)

I've been an index man my whole life and done just fine. Picked a couple stocks occasionally but a couple stocks here and there doesn't make you any money so I quit it. Just recently I decided to get back into picking stocks when I started hearing abount Robinhood all the time, going for some growth/all or nothing plays. I can afford to lose a little money and I had low expectations. Well that was also the same time that I started seeing some WSB posts hit the front page. I had no fucking clue what I was laughing at but I was laughing. WSB memes are a gateway drug. 


$2,500 into RH. Bought WRK shares - a cardboard play - everyone is buying online, there is cardboard all over my house and all over my office. They were underperforming peers, got hit with the COVID, and the five of 10 bullets I read in their 10 point or whatever COVID recovery plan seemed good enough. Solid DD. Went in on Mercado Libre. Boring but solid growth. 


After laughing at all you degenerate fucks for a few months I thought to myself, yeah I should buy an option, without doing any research whatsoever. It's one option MIchael, how much could it cost? I purchased my first option. WRK $45C 12/18. Immediately went red. Didn't care. I needed more. First I had to figure out what the fuck an option was and figure out a better strategy. I knew I was ready when I could finally understand the shitposts. God damn I laugh my ass off reading this sub. And not just a little huff through the nose, like actual laughing. Joy I haven't felt in so long. 


I kept losing more on FDs. I didn't even know what an FD was. I just looked that up yesterday, but apparently that's what I was doing and I am the reason it's called an FD. In bed I would just look at who had earnings coming up and buy calls. I was getting fucked by my stupid plays. V, ACTI, ADM (what the fuck is that even? Bunch of soy bean farms. Who cares???), IP (more fucking cardboard). These stocks are not going to move. Just chipping away at my nut but I was expecting to lose so keep going right? Truly retarted. 


Then who came along? NIO. Fucking NIO. Made some money on calls while it was going from 20>30. Made back my losses and then some. Now I'm main lining heroin. Well shit now I know wtf to do right? Just do whatever WSB is doing. Now I'm staring at RH at work for 30 minutes straight thinking about selling one contract and reading posts on the shitter. Made money on CRSR. Made money on SOLO in the brief period it was popular and killed it on that trade. Now PLTR is fucking gold. I've bought and sold FDs. I'm in on a LEAP. I'm in for stock. TOüöÄ. THEüöÄ. MOON. üöÄ


Now I can't sleep sometimes thinking about my plays that day and the plays I have to monitor the next day. I spend all the god damn zoom meetings I'm in all day staring at tickers. This should not be happening given the amount of money I'm playing with. I've got no positions worth more than a couple hundred bucks. I'm losing sleep over missing out on $20. SO FUCK YOU. BUT ALSO THANKS FOR MAKING ME MONEY, GETTING ME TO LEARN SOME NEW STUFF, FEELING LIKE PART OF THE GANG, AND MOSTLY MAKING ME LAUGH. In 48 days I'm up 75% thanks to WSB (mostly PLTR). I'm going to keep building this nut a bit then YOLO that bitch into a TESLA on whatever meme stock comes next.


There was a post a few weeks ago about people making fancy posts to pump stocks and leaving my retard self holding the bag. Well fuck that. If your DD has bold, paragraphs, some üöÄüöÄüöÄ, and a position then I'm 100% in.

My initial call: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jgnp0s/pltr_unusual_options_very_bullish

I bought PLTR for my 401k under 9 and am still holding. I bought PLTR calls when it was under 10, then at 15, 20, 25, and I‚Äôm still fucking buying.

Somebody already said they‚Äôll buy me 1 share of NIO if PLTR hits 100 by the end of the year and I‚Äôm pretty sure they won‚Äôt deliver, but either way they‚Äôre in for a fucking surprise. 

I work at a large tech company and have had friends at various other large tech companies throughout the years. I‚Äôve heard the same thing from every single person I‚Äôve known who‚Äôs worked at Palantir: they‚Äôll never sell a share. This lockup period means nothing to insiders who see growth and profitability beyond belief. Insiders don‚Äôt want to sell. Machine learning is just starting to take the world by storm and Palantir is the epitome of how to profit from this technology. 

Just so you fucks don‚Äôt get all pissy and disappointed that I don‚Äôt have a different golden play, remember, PLTR is just getting fucking started.

"3 weeks ago I deposited $500 into my account: today my account sits at $27,000 of fully realized gains. The inspiring tale of an Autist's redemption.",0.98,"On November 2nd I deposited $500 into my TDA account (my Robinhood account is restricted, a story for a different day).  I was pissed, tilted, and just frustrated at my shitty decision making.  I decided to take a real hard look at myself and my trading, and then after careful consideration I made the decision to double down on absolutely ridiculous FDs.  [Today I cashed out my positions at $27,000 (I withdrew $13,000 so my balance shows that deficit)](https://imgur.com/a/9nSuJoI). Below is a brief summary of the key moves that I made, please excuse the absolutely atrocious TDA UI display.

First I jumped in on an SQ earnings play ([$455 to $1,925](https://imgur.com/a/HjLFHy1)), then hopped on the PLTR train and grabbed some weeklies ([$1,825 to $6,363](https://imgur.com/a/VQQcEvj)).  I started feeling myself a little and decided to gamble on WMT earnings, which didn't go so well ([$5,569 to $495](https://imgur.com/a/goy1nTj)).  With the rest of my money I decided to switch it up and jump into some TSLA weeklies ([$3,200 to $10,600](https://imgur.com/a/p5yJ72B)).  After some questionable 0DTE plays where I lost 75% of my money I buckled down and jumped into PLTR 11/25 FDs, which was by far my most lucrative play ([$2286 to $27,350](https://imgur.com/a/xfEQLX9)).

In a rare moment of lucidity I cashed out all my positions and withdrew half of my balance (the other half I will be putting into 12/4 NIO calls on Friday).  So what's the point of this story?  A simple one really: if an idiot like me who makes atrocious plays (as evidenced by the above screenshots) can somehow come up with 5400% returns in less then a month, so can you!  All it takes is a gambling addiction, extreme luck, and an unbelievable pump of a meme stock to make it happen.",2020-11-25 20:07:21

"The boring way to make (almost) guaranteed money (LONG AS FUCK, you've been warned)",0.91,"I know that this is a casino/circus/Wendy's, but hear me out.  Anyone who can't read or gets exhausted easily: you'll probably want to stop here.

There was a [post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0ctkd/why_wsb_is_now_running_the_entire_equity_market/) that really put into words what I've been trying to explain to people who don't understand why the market keeps going up despite all reason and logic, and this ties into a process I've been using (pretty successfully) to make realized money (the kind you can spend on things) instead of potential money (which is great for karma, but not much else).

Instead of doing all the DD and research and market analysis, I have adopted what I am calling the surfing model (this may already be a thing but I don't have a finance degree): buy-in (on anything -- no DD) when the MACD-value crosses above the MACD-avg, and RSI is sub-70.  On acquisition, immediately set a trailing-stop @ -XX%.  That's it.  I don't care what the company is, I don't care what it does; I don't need to.  I am only buying to sell for a profit and the MACD trigger is a good indicator that value is about to increase.

Here's one of our favorite meme stocks (SPCE) in action:

[MACD-value \(middle, blue\), MACD-avg \(middle, yellow\), RSI \(bottom\)](https://preview.redd.it/2c2ef82c2f161.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=be0f0612b69c33b071ced1b35524133ca6a4cbcf)

&#x200B;

So why do we use a trailing-stop instead of just selling when the MACD reverses itself?  Because MACD is less granular than the actual value of an asset and may stay steady even with a significant dip in price.  For example, PLTR saw a +10% retraction leading up to earnings, at which point you would have sold your shares (like I did), and then be able to re-buy them (at a profit) $1.86 lower:

[PLTR went from $15 something to $13 something day of ER; if you'd sold and then listened to Warren Buffet you'd have regained all your initial shares plus earned tendies @ \~$1.80\/share.](https://preview.redd.it/n2y18sd43f161.png?width=459&format=png&auto=webp&s=f11879ff59c07f1796aeafc29ab7f20418b80795)

&#x200B;

Of course, this model does have limitations.  This is the surfing model because when you surf, you have to catch the wave at the right point, or you miss is completely.  This means no buying into existing trends, no chasing shit that's already taken off, and no FOMO (which can be a good thing -- if you always wonder why when you buy something it immediately crashes, this is for you).

This also means you could have to wait for a long time to jump into something or miss out out on potential profits, as demonstrated by NIO:

[NIO's wave started back in October \~$24; you'd miss out on 100&#37;+ returns with this model.  Most underlying positions do not have these legs and this model is more focused on delivering consistent returns and less so with potential missed opportunity.](https://preview.redd.it/6ef57jb45f161.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d9ebcec4463705fb80c5e10261f2ec8904e98c2)

&#x200B;

So we've used all clown stocks up to this point; what about boomer stocks and options?  Same thing:

[Even F plays by the rules; remember this is buying on market momentum and let other retards spend all their time doing DD and analysis -- all the lights turn green?  BUY!](https://preview.redd.it/sfwl67pn6f161.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=362b7f282178a5c84282be56f7c0acf3144d50db)

&#x200B;

The trailing-stop set @ -XX% is the market's way of telling you you've probably gotten the best of the wave and it's time to catch a new one (or buy the dip and get tendies as demonstrated in the PLTR example above).  Sure, it may continue on but more than likely you have more opportunities elsewhere (remember stocks/options/companies are cattle, not pets -- use them to make money and move on.  If you're *<insert-meme-stock-here>-gang* you're doing it wrong).

For quick in/out I roll with -5%.  Positions I think have longer term value despite fluctuations I'll set -10% but I NEVER (don't have anything I think is worth that amount of loss) go more than -20%; that's like market/underlying collapse territory and you want to peace the fuck out if that triggers and then buy the bottom.

In addition to protecting profits, this also protects you from gross losses.  PING went all green last week so I jumped in.  It then proceeded to go red dildo and triggered my -5% trailing-stop below what I bought it for.  Instead of getting wiped out, I lost 5% and moved onto something else.  Small losses are manageable and will reduce your tax liabilities.  Huge losses take you out of the game.

Well, if you've made it this far; congrats and good luck.  If you have a system that works awesome for you by all means keep using it.  If you're getting bounced around and can't keep track of what the latest meme stock is or what we're transitioning into/out of, go back through any underlying and see if this model makes you money (yay back-testing!)

EDIT:

Hey look; real-world example!  WORK just spiked b/c of buy-out news and then dropped; trailing-stop adjusted for the spike and then got me out @ $37.20/share, which I could now re-buy @ $36-something for +$1 profit/share:

[Salesforce announced potential buy-out offer of Slack \(WORK\) while I was screwing around on reddit; auto-sell locked-in my gains](https://preview.redd.it/6aui8v44hf161.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a99365e38b35d0e9ebc9e903ca7dc2270a9cc8f)

Here's the 43% gains I made in a week (100 shares is my norm) using this model:

[I'll take 43&#37; profit any day.  Do they all do this well?  No, but the vast majority earn double-digit returns and have minimal downside risk due to the trailing-stop firewall](https://preview.redd.it/9yk9v3fqsf161.png?width=1315&format=png&auto=webp&s=497248d608fe95ae7305e41f097036437dcfbe95)

EDIT 2 & 3:

Running this with ZM presently; changed my trailing-stop to -3% after I cleared my initial -5% threshold (-5% is worth more than what I paid for it).  This will give me less wiggle room to manage bounces but will also protect more profit once it comes back down, presumably after ER next week.

[ZM crapped-out well before ER.  Missed out on some additional gains during the day but it bottomed-out further AH post-ER so I still did ok: $3,500 in 2.5 days of trading \(9.2&#37;\).

Uncle Joe + Auntie Kamala + Mama Yellen = the perfect setup for EV stonks,0.94,"We already know that Biden and Kamala are committed to clean energy and net-zero emissions.

**But did you know that the new pick for Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen is also a green bean?**

She served as a chair of the Group of 30 Working Group on Climate Change and Finance, which released a report this year urging governments, regulators and financial companies to make moves that would sharply curb carbon emissions.

**Biden's corporatism + Yellen's climate focus + strongest stonk market in history = EV go up**

**My focus is on American & European EV plays for the following reasons:**

\- vehicle manufacturers are rapidly pivoting to EV and are likely scouting companies for investments, takeovers, and deals. **They won't touch Chinese EV companies due to regulation & liability. There's a reason that Chinese vehicles aren't allowed in most of the world (sorry NIO longs).**

\- once these deals start to occur, the FOMO will truly be unstoppable, with everybody trying to get in on ""the next Tesla""

\- government incentives: tax rebates, grants, & low interest rates allow companies & individuals to buy EV

IMO, this bubble is just getting started and there are many potential multi-baggers left on the table:

**TSLA calls** \- their first-mover advantage, massive cash flow and market cap make it tough for others to compete, as they can rapidly expand and buy their way into new tech

**CIIC (Arrival SPAC shares & warrants)** \- UK based EV company focused on electric delivery/fleet vehicles and buses. Backed by BlackRock, UPS, Kia & Hyundai. Has deals in place worth as much as $1.2 billion (including 10,000 delivery vehicle order from UPS with potential for more afterwards)

**SBE (ChargePoint SPAC shares & warrants & calls)** \- Worldwide charging network leader. ChargePoint currently accounts for over 73 percent of the L2 charging network in the United States. Backed by BMW, Daimler, Siemens & BlackRock

**PIC (XL Fleet SPAC shares & warrants)** \- Fleet retrofitting to hybrid & electric. Very scalable, with multiple options & lower costs for fleet electrification.

PLTR overperforming = üöÄ,0.96,"**When a stock, with reason to overperform, overperforms, it doesn't mean it's due for correction. It's due for liftoff.**

PLTR is overperforming, according to my TA standards. I considered CRSR and NIO to have both been overperforming when they were trading around $30, respectively, and look at them now. Both in the $50 territory. During this time, moreso expecting a correction, I wanted one. I knew that these companies would grow but it didn't matter. I wanted to get in for a few dollars cheaper. PLTR is not trading at $30 yet, but it doesn't change the fact that they will liftoff. 

CRSR sells computer accessories and peripherals in a time where everyone is building their own PC.

NIO sells electric vehicles in China, where they are actively trying to reduce carbon emissions.

PLTR sells secure, scalable, user-friendly data infrastructure in a time where companies have more data than they know what to do with.

Considerations: Lock-up period and George Soros sell-off. 

Terms of the lock-up in their most recent amended IPO Investment Prospectus found here: [https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-250103/](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-250103/)

tl;dr Lock-up ends three trading days after PLTR discloses Q4 2020 earnings. It's estimated PLTR reports Q4 earnings on [Thursday Feb 11, 2021](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/PLTR/earnings/).

I believe that these two are tied together considering that Soros stated his plans, through his foundation, to sell more PLTR shares as they are allowed.

>When Palantir converted to a public company, SFM‚Äôs interest was converted into shares in the public company. SFM has sold all shares in the company that it is not legally or contractually obliged to hold and will continue to sell shares as permitted. SFM does not approve of Palantir‚Äôs business practices. SFM made this investment at a time when the negative social consequences of big data were less understood. SFM would not make an investment in Palantir today. 

However, Soros is wrong in his understanding of what Palantir does. They provide infrastructure to organize data. Palantir's core principle is privacy by design. You should be assured that they would not work with companies that would use data in the traditional sense of ""big data"" where your data is harvested and sold to advertisers. [https://www.palantir.com/pcl/](https://www.palantir.com/pcl/)

>Palantir was founded on the conviction that it's essential to preserve fundamental principles of privacy and civil liberties while using data.   
>  
>. . .  
>  
>From their first day, new Palantirians are trained to ask: ""Do I want to live in the kind of world that the technology we're building would enable?"" 

Gray area would be [PLTRs effort in combating Covid-19](https://www.palantir.com/covid19/). However it's not really a gray area considering the fact that using patient (not personal) data for analysis is a standard practice in the health industry and serves to improve healthcare and inform the public about the statistics. E.g., Tracking Covid-19 cases would reveal number of cases but not the names of patients.

&#x200B;

In addition, Palantir has a history of philanthropy.

* Palantir has partnered with NMEC for over 7 years to help identify and rescue child victims and prevent future victimization for thousands of child exploitation cases in the United¬†States.
* Palantir works with Team Rubicon. Team Rubicon provides relief efforts after natural disasters.
* Palantir helps to fight world hunger with the World Food Programme, which happens to be the food assistance branch of the United Nations.

THCB - Microvast DD,0.97,"I have been seeing a lot of confusion and or flat out wrong information about THBC/Microvast so I thought I'd make this post to make everything more clear and with proof.

It's best to present this as who is who, and what it what.

&#x200B;

**Tuscan Holdings Corp**

Tuscan Holdings Corp is a blank check company that has two listings on the NASDAQ. Tickers THCB and THCA, both are reserved for future mergers. Each have their own private investors and IPOs to raise money. THCB which is involved with the Microvast merger raised $240 Million and THCA raised $172 Million. These blank check companies originally were seeking weed targets (hence ‚ÄúTHC‚Äù A/B). In saying that, you can see all the people that have invested after the 11/13 announcement here

**EarlyBirdCapital**

EarlyBirdCapital is the investment bank that underwrote the original IPO and are involved in the merger process. The last 4 mergers they were involved in was

TTCF (up 60%)

VLDR (up 70%)

AVCT (down 50%)

BWMX (up 75%)

This was important to mention because the structuring around all these SPACS are fairly similar, but some are more ‚Äúpredatory‚Äù than others. E.g. for a short time, VLDR had some bag holders due to a PIPE dilution being in the original structure that people overlooked.

[http://earlybirdcapital.com/spac-transactions/completed-spac-mergers](http://earlybirdcapital.com/spac-transactions/completed-spac-mergers)

&#x200B;

**Microvast**

Microvast is the intended target. They are an EV Battery company specializing in fast charging. They do not have publicly available financial records. The business does have real products and real people working there. I took the time out to find alleged Microvast (linkedin) workers and find their MS/PhD thesis, publications, etc. The American HQ in Texas is fake. It looks nothing like the building on their website in streetview. It's nothing more than an office. It feels like the equivalent of when [Chinese companies hire White ‚ÄúCEOs‚Äù](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2096341/white-people-wanted-peek-chinas-booming-rent-foreigner-industry). There was an unprofessional non-response when I tried to call in. They have another site in Germany which seems more real both the European and American offices do have actual business contracts though. But in general, this is a 100% Chinese operation, which has some cultural related risks.

There have been some talks about the merger having a high chance of failure, but I do not see that here. The whole point of SPACs is to get insider investors in and out, with a 1- or 2-year deadline to find a company to merge with. Looking for a weed stock, it is obvious that the original private investors are looking for a cash grab through what is hot, and anything EV is hot right now. They are running out of time and Microvast fills that hot market requirement. As for Microvast they too benefit from ‚ÄúIPOing‚Äù in such a hot market.

**Common Stock and Warrant details, and How it all comes together**

If you buy the THCB warrants, you straight up do in fact lose ALL of your money, if the merger fails. The deadline for THCB is Dec-6. This is NOT a hard deadline. IMHO the worst-case scenario in this hot EV market is the SPAC gets a deadline extension, which must be approved within 24hrs. All of this is in the 14A documents linked below. Right now the warrants are 1:1 and trade at $1.80. it means that for every $1.80 you spend on a single warrant you have the rights to buy a single THBC common stock. This is a ""good"" ratio as warrants can be as high as 4-6 warrants per stock. These warrants are saying for each warrant you can buy THCB stock post-merger for $11.50. If the stock reaches over $18 and stays that way for over 20 days THCB/Microvast has the right to redeem all the warrants you have for literally a penny each, a 99%+ lose. \*\*However\*\*, that's only if you don't have the cash to exercise the warrant. For example if you spent $2000 buying 1000 warrants. You need to have ($11.50 \* 1000 = $11.5k) in 30 days or you are SOL. This may be attractive to some people because you only spent $2k in the short term to make ($18 \* 1000 - $11.50 \* 1000) = $6.5k (over 300% gain vs 50% gainn buying shares)

If you are in common stock you are on a safer ""investment"" as the worst case scenario is that the merger fails. In this scenario all the insider shareholders are barred from participating in liquidation. Liquidation is public and through THCB buying 100% of all shares at market value from a $280 million + interest trust fund that has enough money to buy all outstanding shares for $10 a share. In other words, you aren't selling to prevent a 100% loss you are selling to prevent a loss down to available funding. However, this is explicitly not guaranteed. If for some reason THCB were to be sued or faced bankruptcy or had some other debt obligation it would have to come out the trust. The implied risk for me is that that it should be no less than $9-10.

**Green flags:**

No indication of PIPE or other dilution upon merger

Holding $10 minimum value

**Red flags:**

Fast approaching deadline

Sources:

>‚ÄúIf we are unable to complete an initial business combination by 21 months from the closing of this offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest‚Äù  
>  
>‚ÄúThe holders of shares of common stock issued prior to the IPO (‚Äúinsider shares‚Äù) have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to the 6,900,000 insider shares and the 558,589 shares of common stock underlying the units purchased in a private placement simultaneously with the IPO (such shares, the ‚Äúprivate placement shares‚Äù). Additionally, the holders of an aggregate of 300,000 shares of common stock (the ‚Äúrepresentative shares‚Äù) and 128,411 private placement shares issued to EarlyBird Capital, Inc., the representative of the underwriters in the IPO, and its designees have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to such shares. As a consequence of such waivers, a liquidating distribution will be made only with respect to the public shares. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to the Company‚Äôs warrants, which will expire worthless in the event we wind up.‚Äù

So that's about it. There is something to be said about dilution. These SPACs, and emerging companies are in the business of making money. Before SPACs became hot the money to be made was with the warrants. Holding them until merger or expiring worthless. The risk being that a lot of SPACs would fail to merge. After merging everything is a free game as for how the business wants to increase funding. NKLA was a scam product hence they diluted as soon as possible. VLDR diluted but they told people about it in the original documentation. There has been no indication in the THCB documentation that they will dilute. Since they have a real product it will be smarter for them to take the NIO, XPENG, etc. route and hold off while the market is hot.

Short Squeeze on SNOW,0.81,"EDIT, I am NOT predicting a short squeeze, I am saying we are in one, and it will not last

Snowflake was trading at $300 on Oct 22(then went back to 250 in just a couple of days), that was definitely a squeeze. And the stock went up 20% in the last 7 trading days, so we are in another squeeze.

$SNOW one of the most overvalued stock in the market, has a daily short volume of greater than 50%

http://shortvolumes.com/?t=SNOW

Valuation: 
Company is valued at 76 billion (at the current share price of $280) with only a revenue 133m, comparing to NIO that has a revenue of 666.6m last quarter, valued at 72 billion (at the current share price of $53)

Company:
Snowflake is a software company that helps the user managing their data. If for example, you have multiple database on AWS and Azure, you can use snowflake to run analyses and query any of those data. It's essentially a csv parser that depend on AWS and Azure.


Shares:
Currently, there are 278M shares outstanding, with 28M shares float (IPO shares), some of the IPO shares(4M) are bought by Berkshire. And some are bought by ETFs and other institutions. So the actual shares available to trade is very small. The price are high due to demand greatly exceeds the supply. 

** But that is about to change** , on December 16th, 91st day after the date of the prospectus
https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000162828020013667/snowflake424b4.htm

> All of our current employees with a title below vice president, current contractors, former employees (other than Robert L. Muglia, our former chief executive officer, and his affiliates), and former contractors may sell a number of shares equal to 25% of (i) outstanding vested shares and (ii) shares subject to vested stock options and RSUs, each held by such holder or held by trusts for the benefit of such holder or of an immediate family member of such holder, and calculated as of the date of release (Vested Holdings). As of July 31, 2020, 25% of the outstanding Vested Holdings held by such holders was **11,295,695** shares.

And there's more, if after December 15th, out of the 15 trading days, if there are at least 10 trading days where the stock price was higher than **$159.6**, then more shares will be unlocked

> All other non-employee stockholders who are not members of our board of directors or our affiliates (including Mr. Muglia) and whose shares were not included in the First Release, may sell a number of shares equal to 25% of their Vested Holdings. As of July 31, 2020, 25% of the outstanding Vested Holdings held by such holders was **37,904,494** shares. 

Once these shares are unlocked, the snowflake bubble will burst. Smart money bought at the IPO price of $120, they are not buying them at $280.

This year I've been on some crazy runs with stocks with these winners SPCE, NVTA, TSLA, DKNG, NIO, SBE, NKLA, LI

I'm just out of university and have turned a measly 5k into 65K which could have been more but I chose to take profit's and reinvest.

Only loser I've had was PRPO when I bought it on a run and had to take a loss.

I'm not going to say I'm right every time but going from this I have a 88% success rate.

I've sold alot of profit's out today and have parked 15k in $THCB as it seems to be the next moon mission built on HYPE, EV and autism. Does anyone else have any other ideas for potential moon baggers? And what do you think of THCB.

I really like the battery tech and the room to grow is crazy like most EV plays, I'm slightly concerned with management they're unproven.. this however shouldn't matter, this is a hype train that hasn't even left the station yet. See a big run in December, take some profits for my bday üí∞üí∞

$TGT - The Karen Play,0.93,"I‚Äôve posted about TGT before, since those posts (check my history if you want), we‚Äôve seen sizable gains through and after earnings.  

Here‚Äôs what I know about Q4 - 

Target will continue to increase market cap, still under $90B, it remains one of the cheapest retailers in the S&P500.  

With partnerships across multiple entities, and a supply chain that‚Äôs best in class, I don‚Äôt see many reasons to dislike this stock.  To name a few - CVS, Ulta, Shipt, Overstock, Bed Bath and Beyond.  

Target is taking market share from all of their partners, it‚Äôs a natural cannibalizarion, and it will likely continue for some time.  

Target is taking market share from its competitors, mainly WMT and AMZN, as they succeed in the tech space, and the retail space.  

The main competitor which will hurt Target is Costco, which to me, feels like more of a threat to WMT, than TGT.  Why?  Karen.  

Karen loves Target.  There‚Äôs high enough margins on goods, that it keeps most of the poor people at WMT.  

Karen also likes Wholefoods, but she only shops there for special things.  She knows she can get a 10% discount for most of the name brands at Wholefoods vs Target.  

Karen has a RedCard.  The 5% she saves on all transactions, plus free shipping makes it a staple in her wallet.  

Karen uses the Target app or Shipt.  Maybe not as much as AMZN, but it‚Äôs on her Home Screen.  

Karen likes Target pickup.  During a pandemic, nothing is easier that getting your apples brought to your car.  

Karen has unlimited buying power, and is a customer who doesn‚Äôt often change shopping habits.  

Karen is going to buy a bunch of Christmas candles and nonsense decor, where do you think she‚Äôs going to purchase it?  

Karen likes that there‚Äôs a Starbucks in the store, it‚Äôs the main reason she came, but she‚Äôll buy groceries for her kids while she‚Äôs here.  


Retards of WSB, my Karen thesis.  


Thus far, I‚Äôve made $48k on target this year.  

My plays: 

$TGT $180 Mar ‚Äò21
$TGT $180 Dec ‚Äò20
$TGT $185 Dec ‚Äò20
$TGT $185 Jan 21
$TGT $200 Mar ‚Äò21
$TGT $200 Jan ‚Äò21

I also own 500 shares at a cost basis of $140s.

Now I will ask you, don't you agree with me?  Well guess what, If you do, you just failed the test.  I lied about those returns, they were the monthly returns prior to today.

2. GME Spikes big after earnings, which will only rly Happen if Cohen is mentioned in the plan for the future and has found a place in GME, squeeze begins, however not as violent, still awesome though.  
3. Cohen tender offer BEFORE earnings. This would happen if Cohen believes earnings will be good and doesn‚Äôt want to offer after a spike in price.  

Now the most probable scenario imo is Cohen buying right after earnings. Pfizer vaccine will likely be approved a few days after earnings, Cohen would not want to wait after this to buy and end up having to offer at a higher price. Also, with Christmas sales coming, he won‚Äôt want to risk a run up of GME before he buys.  

Technicals are strong af and IWM is ripping.  

Just buy GME.

Evolus - Breakout potential (DD),0.86,"Everyone is asking what the next cheap meme stock will be now that NIO and PLTR are too expensive. I present my DD on Evolus, Inc (EOLS). Trading at $4.07 / share. I‚Äôve been following this for months.

**Background:**

Ever heard of Botox? Yeah it‚Äôs for boomers and it‚Äôs owned by Allergan, a massive boomer company. The market for Botox is roughly $5 billion.

Well Evolus makes a competitive product called Jeuveau that is targeted at Becky‚Äôs in their mid-20‚Äôs and 30‚Äôs who want to look good on Instagram. Now Botox/Allergen got greedy and sued Evolus. Evolus was at the time a $1billion market cap trading at $25 a share.

Allergen and their big expensive lawyers got a judge to screw Evolus and rule that they stole trade secrets, and Jeuveau got banned for 10 years from the US. As a result the stock dropped to $3 and change. Thing is, the judge screwed up, and if you look at the technology, there is no basis for Allergen‚Äôs arguments from a tech standpoint, they just have expensive lawyers.

The ITC is currently reviewing the case and are expecting to overrule soon. It was actually supposed to be last week but got pushed to December. Stock is up 16% on the news and as soon as it‚Äôs overturned we‚Äôre back to $24. Massive market potential that Botox hasn‚Äôt fought for and great branding on Evolus‚Äô side. Stock was up 20% Friday on the news, another 2% today.

**Positions**

I‚Äôm long 4,000 shares and options laddered from 4/16/21 to 7/16/21 and 1/21/22.

**TL;DR:**

Cheap stock with massive upside on a ruling that is coming Dec 16th. Stock dropped on a bad ruling and will rocket when the ruling is overturned on 12/16/20.",2020-11-23 14:45:26

So since I've been on a mini hiatus from here. After correctly calling the DKNG/PTON/CRWD (Check post history) run-up & for those that got out early enough, some mini tendies on PM (if you held, I'm sorry, GTFO), I've been doing work behind the scenes & correctly called XPEV/NIO, CRSR, then TSLA.

I still hold a majority of the above positions, though I've reduced some XPEV/CRSR primarily due to its run-up making the positions become too big. TSLA, even after my selldown is still a significant part of my portfolio.

With that said - here's some good ol' fundamental DD for you folks on my next play. **Huazhu Hotels Group (NASDAQ: HTHT)**. **This will be long, I'll try to be short & succinct & below I've included a TL;DR; but maximum tendies will be gifted to those who learn 2 read**.

**I. 30,000 Feet Up - China's 14th 5-Year Plan**

My HTHT thesis aligns with what got me into XPEV at the $20s. Even if you don't take my word for it, Google around - the foundation of the Chinese economy is based on Government policy. It isn't like the US, where big money drives political processes in the shadows. In China, decisions about medium-term / long-term business begin in the political sphere. So, on October 29th, 2020, the Chinese Communist Party (""CCP""), wrapped up after meeting for 4 days on the high level themes of China's [14th 5-Year Plan](https://www.ft.com/content/8e60bf15-2005-442c-ae59-e51d74a93856). The final details will be announced around March/April of 2021 (which drives my reasoning why XPEV/NIO & other related stocks should be held to after this date), at which the market will be able to apply more than estimates/qualitative assessments to beneficiaries of this plan. HTHT & XPEV/NIO fall under all 3 ""Key Themes"" of the Plan which are:

1. *Theme #1: Domestic Dependency - New Energy - Electronic Vehicles & Related Supply Chain (Battery Tech & EV Charging Piles)* \--> XPEV / NIO
2. *Theme #2: Domestic Demand / Theme #3: Digitization - Value-Added Products/Content* \--> HTHT

Other big picture drivers are ongoing Dollar weakness relative to the Yuan, China's outperformance in handling COVID relative to the US & Europe, both of which I won't discuss in great detail here but are easily researchable. These are all additional tailwinds for HTHT.

How successful has China been on implementing past ""5-Year Plans""? Below is a nice infographic summarizing them. It's almost safe to assume that 5-Year Plan targets are the floor cases of what China is striving to achieve:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jhech1vp0y061.jpg?width=679&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a873e9ed26e3ac980a38a7e435a67845b8d072a5

What are the benefits to Chinese businesses that align themselves with Chinese government policy? Cheap capital & outsized governmental support. *Put simply: It's like having a JPoW picking certain industries every 5 years to unleash the money printer on + having Congress pass very biz friendly laws in tandem.*

**II. 10,000 Feet Up - China's Only Trade Deficit - Service Sectors**

Overall, China has an overall significant trade surplus over the US (+$3.5 Trillion), but a deficit in the following 5 sectors - Domestic Travel, Discretionary Consumption, Entertainment, Education & Drugs & Medical Devices.

My view is that China will be pushing to create surpluses in all of them, but the most realistic sectors are in Domestic Travel / Discretionary Consumption (HTHT + XPEV/NIO) & a bit on the Healthcare side, which I'm exploring at the moment (DD to come). I still think US-based entertainment (Hollywood, NBA, etc.) will not be replaced in our lifetimes so let's focus on hotels.

Currently HTHT's portfolio is split by # of rooms 49% vs. 51% of total in the Upper/Midscale vs. Economy segment. Below is a quick summary of their portfolio of brands:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wbtzyyg01y061.jpg?width=526&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc8cde772bf3cdf54eb524c3aa2506d477cfba77

While many of these brands may not be familiar to us autists here vs. the brands Marriott / Hilton / Hyatt have, you can bet that with the signing of largest trade agreement signed in history - the [Free Trade Agreement](https://www.ft.com/content/2dff91bd-ceeb-4567-9f9f-c50b7876adce) & the quicker recovery from COVID in China, that these brands will be on flagship real estate assets across the world in the near future.

As an aside, Wall Street estimates that HTHT grows Room count by \~30% from year end 2020 to year end 2021, for an eventual mix weighted more towards the Upper/Midscale segment (56% vs. 44%, Upper/Midscale vs. Economy)

**III. Ground Level - HTHT Business Strategy & Financials**

So a very quick primer on how Hotels make money. There are 2 strategies - franchise / leased/operated. The Franchise strategy is higher margin, higher certainty of cash flows, is lower volatility, and captures *some* upside if business improves drastically. The leased/operated model is lower certainty of cash flows, higher volatility, and receives a bulk of outsized upside in the business. Overall, investors assign a much higher multiple to the franchise model. Taking a look at Marriott's historical EV/EBITDA vs. Host Hotels (HST)'s will show you this clearly. (Marriott trades >20x, HST \~10-15x)

Basically, how all the current major hotel brands started, like Marriott, was by having a primarily leased/operated model then when their brands began gaining awareness, spun-off their leased/operated business (usually to a hotel REIT) & became a primarily franchise business. This has been the path of all of the major hotel chains in the past, & if you were an investor in Marriott then, you made out like a bandit today (15x gains through time period).

Currently, HTHT's Revenue mix of franchise / leased/operated hotels is 31%/69% by Revenues. According to a survey by Frost & Sullivan in July 2020 on the Chinese consumer, HTHT's brand, HanTing Hotel is the #1 economy hotel brand that is 'top of mind' for the Chinese consumer & HTHT's midscale brand JI Hotel is #1 in the midscale segment. Brand momentum outside of the US has steadily been climbing for years which coincides with the Company's recent shift in becoming 'asset-lite' or in autist speak, are going to pursue a primarily Franchise model.

With that said - Wall Street estimates HTHT's franchised business is set to grow by >100% from '20 to '21, and the Revenue mix is set to go from 69% from Leased/Operated today to low 60%s by '22E.

This will be driven by a quicker & already recovering economy in China + global expansion backed by government policy.

Here's a snapshot on China's hotel recovery vs. other major cities per STR (based on RevPAR - Google if you don't know what this is - this is the main Hotel Revenue metric combining ADR & Occupancy):

&#x200B;

[Pay attention to growth from Aug '20 to Oct '20 - Beijing +51&#37; vs. London -3&#37; vs. Hong Kong +37&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/mnp64ghz4y061.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12f25ffa0170142def79515f52e866541dd42100)

[Beijing +51&#37; \(from earlier\) vs. NYC +2&#37; vs. Tokyo +79&#37; - Overall: Asia's travel sector is recovering](https://preview.redd.it/1jxte0vg5y061.jpg?width=1055&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3174187b78f1464457ac337219ba274901becd5d)

*In addition to the above RevPAR metrics, something else to note from the numbers. At Beijing's $55.01 RevPAR, they are >50% recovered from the average RevPAR throughout 2019 vs. London where current RevPAR is still \~20% of what they accomplished in 2019. Though Tokyo had some massive growth, they are still only \~33% of 2019s RevPAR*

Have you read this far yet? Lucky you - you get my exit strategy. $65/Share.

**So they're just going to be the Chinese Marriott - so what? What** ***differentiates*** **them like XPEV/NIO?**

**Growth.**

The Hotel industry hit the shittiest of shit recently, so all of them are coming off of ridiculously low bases. Even then, HTHT is expected to grow their EBITDA from '20 to '22E at a +209% CAGR vs. Marriott at +62%, and Hilton at +57%.

These estimates are extremely conservative in my view - downplaying HTHT getting the backing like NIO/XPEV to *export* its product overseas + the rapidly recovering Chinese economy relative to the US. Again, you will see their brands become flags in major cities in the coming years.

From a Valuation perspective, HTHT has had a decent run-up in the last month since the CCP unveiled the rough outline of their 5-Year plan, & they released [preliminary 3Q'20 results](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/huazhu-group-limited-announces-preliminary-results-for-hotel-operations-in-the-0) (which show a much improved/improving outlook - significant recovery in mid/upscale brands) but it is still undervalued in my view relative to the major Hotel peers. This is evident in EV/EBITDA.

Even with the conservative case of 3x the growth embedded in estimates vs. Marriott, HTHT trades at EV/EBITDA of \~20x, vs. Hyatt at \~24x, Marriott at \~19x, & Hilton at \~19.5x. Historically, Marriott has traded at \~22x when expectations for growth were a lot lower than they are today.

**Conclusion:**

**I see HTHT getting to >22x EV/EBITDA very quickly or \~$70+ a Share, and this is on estimates that do not fully account for franchise expansion on CCP support.**

**TL;DR $55C+, 3/2021 & beyond**

So this brings us to the question: ""***what should you do to start winning?""***

[Your portfolio](https://preview.redd.it/w72jbsia4y061.png?width=1980&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7311d5b126d6039f99e0fc2ef7d0dfa4dc8aecf)

The answer is to start **selling options**. Imagine that for every loss you have ever incurred, your wife's boyfriend was on the opposite side of the trade, sniggering at you as you reach into your wife's purse to take our her credit card, deposit your funds into Robinhood, and purchase $NIO calls. He knows that $NIO calls are simply a means for you to transfer money into his pocket. He happily collects the premium that you just paid and drives off to Wendy's to collect his $4 for 4 happy meal. As he drives by, he sees a figure behind the dumpster, on his knees, and gives thanks to the lord that there exists a retard in this world that can feed him.

**CAN YOU NOT DESPISE THIS MAN? HE IS SO SUCCESSFUL! THIS COULD BE YOU!**

[Beth beats Borgov](https://preview.redd.it/2racqu7g4y061.png?width=1512&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab08f4c47de45575f83f170483f4a891b8cb5479)

At the end of the series, Beth eventually takes down the Russian Grandmaster Borgov. I found this scene to be particularly insightful because it shows how one can overcome his/her addiction to eventually achieve true success. I encourage the members of WSB to take this Thanksgiving week to think about what their addictions are, and what steps they can take to achieve freedom.

"DD for 11/19-11/22 American Eagle, Emerson, and Doomsday, TLDR and plays included",0.92,"**Welcome back to the WSB DD!** As in previous posts, the ticker will be in bold on the left and I write this so the info that I deem most ‚Äúimportant‚Äù will be near the top. I would ask you to read all the way through to get the most information you can but honestly, I don‚Äôt give a shit. As always a follow-up from previous DD posts, TLDR, and plays will be at the bottom. Feel free to ask questions, I am happy to answer anything as long as it‚Äôs not stupid as fuck.

&#x200B;

**URBN/AEO);** Now remember, I specialize in earnings plays. This is because they are the easiest to anticipate given the fact that nothing is easy to anticipate in the stock market. We all know what Urban Outfitters and American Eagle are, trendy clothing stores that are doing surprisingly well for still being in a pandemic. Here is why they are on my radar. First, these are companies that have rebounded well but still have room to go up, especially American Eagle as their price has been much higher. Second, every retail clothing store that has reported earnings recently has crushed them. It's the same story every time. [Childrens Place](http://investor.childrensplace.com/static-files/9821ff11-0580-47b7-8425-db47ee140512) expected EPS was .36, actual was 1.44 and they rose 10% EVEN AFTER already having risen 50% in the last month. [Shoe Carnival](https://investors.shoecarnival.com/news/news-details/2020/Shoe-Carnival-Reports-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2020-Results/default.aspx) expected EPS was .7, actual was 1.03 and they rose 6%. [Kohls](https://s26.q4cdn.com/950703131/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/KSS-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation-vFinal-(11.17.20).pdf) expected EPS was -.43, actual was .01 and they rose 16% EVEN AFTER already having risen 32% in the last month. Do you see the pattern? Here's the deal, you wait until Urban Outfitters releases their earnings. If the pattern holds true then American Eagle will be a slam dunk. If it doesn‚Äôt? Well, I‚Äôm still gonna try because I‚Äôm a greedy bastard. I'm not gonna say it's free money, but I will heavily imply it and let you come to your own conclusions. This is the play I am most anticipating to make. I really think it's going to be a win. I could write more about this but I know most of you aren't even gonna make it this far before saying, ""tO mANy WOrdS, i'M IN.""

&#x200B;

**EMR;** Emerson is an electric company based out of Missouri which has been around for 1890. They manufacture products and provide engineering services for a wide range of industrial, commercial, and consumer markets. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jxq3s2/emerson_emr_dd/) talks about how they make temperature shit and we will use that when transporting vaccines. Okay sure maybe. They make less than 25% of their income from ‚ÄúClimate Solutions‚Äù as it says in their [earnings](https://www.emerson.com/documents/corporate/emerson-reports-fourth-quarter-full-year-2020-results-provides-initial-2021-outlook-en-us-7186070.pdf). This means that an increase in contracts in temperature monitoring won't increase the net sales by enough to cause the stock to move up significantly.

The interesting thing about this company though, is that they keep a debt to asset ratio of 1 at all times. I can make a post explaining debt to asset ratios and what they mean for a company if you‚Äôd like so comment if you want to see that. They have continually done this for YEARS. I'm not giving you an exact date because I looked back every year until [2009](https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/emerson_electric2/SEC/sec-show.aspx?Type=html&FilingId=7576151&CIK=0000032604&Index=10000) and they have had the same amount of debt as assets. This means they are very good at managing their debt and a company as old as this should be. Other reasons are that Emerson has consistently made money and will continue to do so in the future. Earnings were decent in light of demand going down so if they can make it through this with no more debt than usual then they can make it through anything.

The OP says calls but I sincerely doubt that it will move enough short term for calls to be profitable. Shares are the way to go given that the stock price is still below what it was before the crash. Emerson is not going away any time soon. This is a safe and steady stock to buy.

&#x200B;

**Doomsday Bears;** Now I know all saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jx2zez/the_gayest_gay_bear_post_in_the_history_of_wsb_we/) which is calling for the market's doom. It goes over a shit ton of technicals and reasons why it is GOING to happen according to him. Sure the market is going to go down again, but that in no way means that it will happen soon. I am sure that weeks will tick by before we even get close to the possibility of it going down. Here are the most likely scenarios; Scenario 1 is that COVID numbers continue to go up and this thing doesn‚Äôt go away for a long time. In this case, the market will have another crash because it is being held up by the federal government. It will rebound but a lot more slowly than before because people won't be as confident as before. Scenario 2 is that this is the last spike, a vaccine comes out, and the market forgets about all the damage the WuFlu has caused. Honestly, scenario 2 is the most likely. All of this doesn‚Äôt mean that we won‚Äôt have dips. We will. But we, as the cucks of WallStreetBets, will make money on the up and down. As Warren Buffet so thoughtfully said, ""Buy the dip, cuck."" The best guidance I can give is to try not to get into long term commitments. Stay short term because we never know exactly when it is going to go down. When the decline comes, we will buy puts as is the WSB way. We will lose all of our money but that's okay because a well-timed yolo will put us back in gambling territory. We are strong, we are many, we are fucking idiots, and if there is one thing I know, it's that we can make and lose money off of absolutely anything. So we will.

**Follow up;** ebay ($EBAY) is at a discount after its drop Friday. Shares are cheaper now and I believe they will only go up as we move through the holiday season. Read the DD from 11/15-11/18 for more info. I am in the process of writing up my take on market psychology. Expect it sometime in the coming week. And in case any of you are wondering, I don't add huge popularity stocks on here like Tesla, NIO, and lately Butterfly. There is just an overwhelming wealth of information about them. This added to the fact that popularity makes a stock irrational leads me to the decision to stay away from them.

&#x200B;

Good luck fuckers and tune in Wednesday and Sunday nights for more WSB DD!

**TLDR;** Urban Outfitters and American Eagle are great candidates for an earnings play, Emerson is a great long term investment, Doomsday had not been predicted but you should still be prepared for it.

**Plays;** AEO ITM or slightly OTM calls if URBN follows the pattern, EMR stocks (or long term calls if you only do options)

Unpopular Opinion: These Fund managers aren't here to take money from us; they're actually learning how to make money from us. ü§Øü§Øü§Ø

Think about that for one second. You think these billionaires/millionaires want a piece of our $1000 robinhood accounts?
No way, we're too poor for them to give a shit. They got better things to do than shake our weak ass hands. 

But the one thing we do have that they don't is foresight of technology. These millionaire/billionaire boomers don't know shit about tech (except that Chamath Palapitylapity mfer). It's a fckn fugazi to them. Google Warren Muffin's Phone or whatever that fuckers name is for proof. Do you see a mfin smartphone? I see a Samsung flip phone on one of Apple's biggest investors. *He's one of us!*

These mfers come here and take our hard earned DD and make money for themselves while we do all the hard work. These are the same mfers that copied homework from you in the library right before 1st period high school and got A's while your dumbass be getting C's. It's no coincidence that AMD, TSLA, NIO, PLTR have mooned the past year for being a meme.

PLTR is on a one-way taxi to the MOON,0.95,"If there are two types of people you should listen to they are taxi drivers and barbers. reason being they meet and chat up so many different autists in the most truthful state; drunk or with blades to your neck. Most taxi drivers get their stock tips from drunk idiots that mumble the next big play. So last time my dad ( a taxi driver) mentioned a stock (NIO, mentioned in early July cause all his taxi friends were buying it and talking about it) that stock skyrocketed. Before that bunch of his taxi friends bought tesla (April). Before that, they talked about Shopify (2017), and before that amazon (2016).  I have noticed a  STUNNING pattern here. Whatever stock my dad and his taxi friends talk about seems to blow up. The reason being if the average joe knows about it, is discussing it with their friends and family, and showing interest in buying the stock, a lot of the Joes EVERYWHERE are probably doing the same. Just today my dad asked me what big data meant, and I asked him why (never would expect such a word to come out my dad's mouth as is he is as tech smart as an AMISH. He said his taxi PALS said to buy PLTR in their WhatsApp group chat.  This is ABSOLUTE proof, guys. PLTR is only going UPPPPPP.  I am buying in again come Monday.

The Most Popular Contracts on Reddit this Week,0.93,"#Which companies are Redditors betting on?

The explosion of companies like NIO and PLTR has not been missed on Reddit. In fact, [these two tickers are the most popular this week](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditTickers/), with NIO being mentioned 15,867 times and PLTR 10,570 times in the past six days (not including today).

In addition to mentioning these tickers over 10,000 times each, Redditors have bet big on the future share prices of NIO, PLTR, and other companies. In fact, Redditors have mentioned a total of over 2,000 option contracts in the past week. So, how well have these contracts performed? We can look at the 25 most popular contracts to find out:

24|AAL|$12.5|PUT|11/20|YES|OTM
25|PLTR|$20|CALL|1/15/21|NO|OTM

The table below shows totals for the contracts status:

. |ITM|OTM|Total
:--|:--|:--|:--
Expired|3|7|10
Not Expired|3|12|15
Total|6|19|25

Out of the expired contracts, 30% were ITM and 70% were OTM. Notably, the AAL $12.5 PUT 11/20 expired just $0.03 OTM. The majority of non-expired contracts are OTM, with just 20% being ITM. The CRSR $40 CALL 12/18 is just $0.33 ITM right now. Currently, just 24% of contracts are ITM with 76% OTM as of market close yesterday. 

Redditors seem especially bullish on PLTR and NIO with both tickers having significantly high call volume than put volume. Redditors appear bearish on recovery stocks, including Carnival Corporation and American Airlines Group.

I know I will be watching closely to see whether the 15 non-expired contracts become ITM.

NIO: The biggest bull argument for NIO that NOBODY is talking about,0.83,"
The biggest bull argument for NIO that NOBODY is talking about: Chinese AI Full-Autonomous Driving 
 
AI driving is coming, as we all should know by now. 
We all hear that Tesla is the world leader, blah blah. BUT.. they are an AMERICAN company. China will inevitably want AI driving in their country. Do you really believe they will allow American AI to be driving and collecting data on Chinese roads?  
Enter: NIO
 
NIO has proven to be able to develop AI Self-Driving capabilities and is in the process of developing fully autonomous driving. There‚Äòs a good reason China is backing Chinese-based EV companies and especially 
NIO in particular.

Growth Opportunity for $GM and their lineup of EVs,0.81,"**Growth Opportunity for $GM and their lineup of EVs**

First, I‚Äôd like to preface with my understanding that General Motors has a terrible track record when it comes to EVs. In fact, their EV1 (the first mass produced electric vehicle) took a colossal shit in the 90s- leading to the recall and destruction of nearly all leased cars. Even looking at present day, current offerings are also shit; the volt is disturbingly ugly and costs too much, and the bolt looks like a premature avocado. That said, I see a bright future for $GM in the coming months.

**$GM vs $TSLA for the consumer EV**

Tesla (TSLA) obviously has the predominant market share of US EV market, but GM is well equipped to take over a significant portion of the Chinese market. Elon constantly talks of a $25k Tesla for the ‚Äúpoors‚Äù, but the three-year timeline for this is uncertain. Hongguang Mini, made by a GM joint venture, costs just $4,300 and is currently the bestselling EV in China (surpassing the M3). While something this small most likely wouldn‚Äôt succeed in US or Canadian markets, there is a large opportunity within Asian and European markets. GM (thus far) has predominant market share in the entry level EVs.

&amp;#x200B;

[$4,300!](https://preview.redd.it/6kdoyll86n061.jpg?width=2500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5533bc905b40d7f4bc67ddec715bb8cd2d2fe634)

**$GM ups spending on EVs and autonomous cars by 35% to $27 billion**

&amp;#x200B;

* GM will spend $27 billion on all-electric and autonomous vehicles through 2025, an increase of $7 billion, from initial plans announced in March.
* The increase in investment will support GM‚Äôs plans to release 30 new EVs globally by 2025, including more than 20 for North America.
* GM said it has moved up the release of 12 EVs, including pickups for its Chevrolet and GMC brands.

Comparing Tesla and General Motor‚Äôs R&amp;D costs, GM spent about $7.8 billion on research and development in 2018, an amount that was again 5X more than Tesla‚Äôs R&amp;D spending of $1.5 billion during the same year. That said, Tesla is obviously the leader in this EV market. So how will this 35% increase put GM ahead?

https://preview.redd.it/kwfxcdw36n061.jpg?width=639&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7fb1dbcdd91bb0740f04a0afc8db242250672c16

As seen from the chart, from 2013 to 2015, Tesla‚Äôs R&amp;D spending ratio rose quickly from 11% to 18% revenue whereas GM‚Äôs R&amp;D spending ratio has more or less stayed in the same range at 5% during the same period. However, the gap of R&amp;D ratio between Tesla and GM were closing in in 2019 at 5% when Tesla‚Äôs figure was seen de-accelerating since 2016 and reached the lowest at 5% revenue in 2019.

While Tesla‚Äôs R&amp;D budget growth rate turned negative in 2019, the average figure was still around 40% for the past 7 years which is much better than GM‚Äôs average R&amp;D expenses growth rate of -1% over the same period.

In other words, GM‚Äôs R&amp;D expenses have roughly stayed in the same level in average from 2013 to 2019. This increase in spending will be help GM reach its new goal of launching 30 new EVs 2025. This is a significant increase from the previously stated 22 vehicles.

This increased spending will also go towards the second generation of its uItium battery when it is released in 2025. This battery will be 60% cheaper than the Chevrolet Bolt battery, while doubling the expected energy density. Furthermore, GM has partnered with LG to manufacture the ultium battery at a plant in Lordstown, Ohio, which opens in the first quarter of 2021 and will have a capacity for 30 GWh/yr. On the contrary, battery production at Gigafactory 1 reached an annualized rate of roughly 20 GWh in 2018.

**Technicals**

*I‚Äôll be honest, I know nothing about fundamentals, P/E ratios, or even what the greeks mean. I haven‚Äôt taken a single economics finance course in college- I study rhetoric. However, I do my research and take buying opportunities when I see them. I‚Äôll refer to Deutsche Bank and their 12% increased price target on Friday.*

""We are very encouraged by GM's updated product and investment strategy and targeted cost/margin trajectory, which could ultimately give it a strong market position and solid profitability in EVs‚Äù.

https://preview.redd.it/tmv0umad6n061.jpg?width=1400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=057ebfb940124c31343ab6dc557af6870f3024af

From a price perspective, GM hasn‚Äôt moved above its October 2017 all-time high and has only just moved beyond its earlier peak in December 2013. In respect to EV stocks, GM‚Äôs trading volume is still relatively low @ 16M Friday. Comparing $NIO @ 209M, $TSLA @ 32M, and shit $NKLA @ 18M - retails investors have yet to consider $GM in this EV race. Once volume and media news increases, I can see volume and price increasing easily.

**Design**

From the examples seen thus far, General Motors is not fucking around when it comes to design. Take the recent C8 for example: The C8 is using the same type of materials as the C7 (aluminum frame, plastic and carbon body), manufacturing techniques, and the same types of engine components that they already have. Yes, a mid-engine car is theoretically better, but design innovations have been at the center of discussion within the industry.

&amp;#x200B;

The Hummer Ev and Cadillac Lyric look fantastic, and will provide luxury consumers the ability to choose something other than a Tesla, Audi e-tron, or EQC in the coming years. GM has also teased the new Chevy EV truck, exemplifying this continued design innovation.

&amp;#x200B;

Using 6% rule to escape PDT restrictions on Robinhood?,0.72,"Or other brokers but all the other ones suck.

Recently I confirmed with Robinhood support that you will not be flagged as a PDT through their system if you fall within the limits of the 6% rule. They also said that will not mean day trades are not added to their tracker though.

So does this mean I could just buy .0001 shares of Tesla 100 times on Mon, sell on Tuesday. Buy .01 shares of Nio 100 times, sell on Wed. Rinse and repeat? 

I‚Äôm not sure how they define ‚Äútrades‚Äù but I would think this works to allow me to make 12 day trades a week instead of 4.

The Curious Case for Clean Energy,0.85,"So we've all seen what weaponized autism can do to stocks like NIO and Tesla and I'm here to say things are just getting started. The emergence of PLUG and FCEL should be great indicators of the appetite for this sector. Electric energy is the basis for our technology-driven society and with all the blame for pollution landing on FF corps clean energy is the answer (Exxon used to be one of the most valuable companies pre2010 after all). 

So what should you invest in? My argument is not NIO and Tesla. Wait what, that's heresy?! Steady now and hear me out. That's like the equivalent of buying a Ford or GM and subject to tastes, availability, competition, and functionality. I don't know if you've seen recent news on Ford or GM but they are going to bring the heat really soon to these only EV companies. Ford and GM will literally flood the market with availability and the mass production will be extremely difficult for these fresh companies to compete with. The legacy car companies will transform into tech companies with rivaling battery and AI tech. Arguably not as good for maybe a decade but they will throw enough money at the problem to make themselves competitive before 2025. 

So Ford and GM calls then right? Well, I've made out well doing so but that's still a long value-driven play in my opinion. Not to mention all the boomers in these companies that pullout after pennies of profits and stupid amounts of volume makes it rather difficult to move the stocks in meaningful capacities when most make out better in NIO and Tesla. I'd recommend IDRV if you'd like complete exposure to the likes of Tesla, Nio, Ford, GM, and NVDA. But it's still not what the biggest boom in the room over the next 5 years.

Invest in TAN, ICLN, and QCLN. ALL equally good and still undervalued. How are they undervalued after +100% gains since March lows. Well, that's because the true weaponize autist hasn't hit them yet. Who is this Max level autist? It's none other than the US Federal Reserve. I'm not guaranteeing the Green New Deal but you'd be a retard to not see the trend that's happening. A literal energy and power renaissance from FF to Renewables. Governments worldwide are banning non-EV car sales past 2030, pulling funding from gas and oil projects everywhere, banning single-use plastics, and removing the subsidies that are floating FF in the markets currently. Politicians aren't dumb and they follow the money as well and won't be receiving the same level of corrupt payments they have been when the petrodollar was king. Biden will make renewables into the new energy giants and absolutely ass blast the entire sector with a literal money cannon that will force profitability for all involved. So don't invest in just one company that gets a piece of the pie. Invest in the sector with the ICLN, QCLN, and TAN that get the whole pie! Well, the Senate won't let them do that. Mind you over 60% of Repubs are for renewables, and many of them are aware that their reelections could hinge on their decisions on this matter. The Dems literally only need to flip less than a hand full of them to get it done. Big banks are also front running and funding a ton of clean energy projects and stocks while refusing to fund FF anymore. Electricity is the currency, fuel, information, and fun of the future. The time has come to get free energy from the sun, who's with me!

TLDR: buy clean energy etf calls

Trying to find the next meme. Liquified Nat Gas and engines for alt energy vehicles,0.73,"Long discussion ahead. Skip to bottom for positions. Buy WPRT Calls.

TL;DR is that I think this has potential to become a meme soon.

By EOD I bailed on everything I had in EVs/FCEL/PLUG, aside from my Nio shares. Maybe I dipped out too early, but I think the EVs and likes of PLUG/FCEL are gonna be difficult to navigate now that the initial hysteria could be dying off. both FCEL and PLUG closed below the highs they hit on Thursday, but who knows, market gonna market. Anyway.

I don't think we're done with alternative energy and tech. What I like now are alternative fuel sources for cars - namely liquified, renewable, and compressed natural gas. Some of this shit is even made from waste products and I'm told it's a cleaner alternative to regular old fuel. The best part is, there are some actual sales and usage of this already. I like the market to transition to alt energy that is a little more profitable in the short-term, as they've been dumping a ton of money into companies that have little or zero revenue. We either go full retard into EVs and hydrogen or we see a short pull back.

Right now the US only has like 200k of these vehicles max, mainly trucks, buses, and other heavy vehicles. Plenty of room for growth. China has 5 million, but I don't know of the companies who did it there. The most glaring problem is that this technology has already been tried and failed, but this redemption story is playing out now in the hydrogen sector with PLUG/FCEL. The U.S. made a huge push for this back in 2008 and the two stocks I'll be talking about hit their ATH in 2012 (WPRT $45 and CLNE $28). Currently they're sitting at $3.50ish a share.

However, I believe we see a renewed interest now with Biden in office and this hype for greener energy solutions. This shit is something we have available now and can start using today until things like hydrogen and EVs become the norm. It's ideal for the transition and we do need realistic and practical solutions for right now, until newer tech gets where it needs to be.

WPRT is my favorite of the two. They make the engines and components for vehicles using natural gas and hydrogen. They're under Cummins (CMI), which has proven to be an outstanding company. WPRT has doubled in the last 2 weeks, up 12% Friday on good, but not insane volume.

CLNE is a pure play on liquified/compressed/renewable natural gas and fueling stations. The stock is up 40% in the last 2 weeks. Up almost 9% Friday on good volume. I think WPRT is the true play, as their financials look better and have ties to Cummins. Not to mention they are involved with both nat gas and hydrogen.

Both stocks are still under the radar and have had mooning days, but also flat days and red days, so they're far from meme status. They closed near their daily highs, while many stocks faded. Someone is buying this shit. I see huge potential here, but it could easily fizzle out without some kind of news in the form of increased government backing or new contracts from a huge companies.

**Positions: WPRT $3 calls 12/18, WPRT $4 calls 01/15 (66%)**

**CLNE $3 calls 12/18, CLNE $4 calls 01/15   (33%)**

- Thanksgiving coming on Thursday (people saying use Zoom versus visiting)
- Zoom is offering unlimited time on Thanksgiving. Solid PR by them. Gets people talking 
- Zoom earnings report November 30th after hours. Stock went up fast last ER run up then jumped 45%+/- next day. Remember that? Also, remember negative oil?
- Cases rising and lockdowns = boomers, WSB, and millennial plebs rotating their Robinhood accounts back into tech and home stocks.

I've seen some clueless investors comparing NNDM to the next Tesla, NIO and even apple (WTF??). Even after they‚Äôve had 7+ direct offerings this year valued over 200mil. They wont let it drop. The truth is that NNDM only has one shitty product for sale on the market and it is extremely niche. They have a market cap of 400mill and only had 400,000 in revenue this quarter (yes you read that correctly) putting its price to sales ratio at roughly 120+.  After earnings, which showed revenue dropped 80% year over year, the stock ran to new all time highs. Why? Because of Cathie Wood's simp army.

It looks like the Chinese govt might be taking a protectionist posture with regard to the EV market in China. I think strategically this makes sense. They have targets to hit per the Paris Agreement, and Transportation is part of that. Also, as we both know, China is thirsty for oil, and to the extent they can reduce demand for it within their transportation sector, the more liberty/freedom they might enjoy internationally. Viewed from this angle, the $1bn investment seems shrewd and opportunistic. It also looks protectionist.

$TLS - A baby Palantir has hatched!,0.9,"Welp, I have had the extremely good fortune of being one of the people who jumped into Palantir with both feet on IPO day, and I am here today with another tip.

I have been watching all these tech IPOs, and most of them have been doing exceptionally well for the past few months. So any time I see an IPO now, I check it out.

**Today a tiny little baby Palantir was hatched - Telos Corporation - $TLS**

# Ties to big brother. ‚úÖ

Like Palantir, Telos is a cyber security company. And like Palantir, these guys do work for the military and US government.

# Connections with the right people. ‚úÖ

They have a board member who is a General that was in charge of the US cyber security:

&#x200B;

>*General Keith B. Alexander, USA, served as the Commander, U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and Director, National Security Agency/Chief, Central Security Service (NSA/CSS), Fort George G. Meade, MD. As Commander, USCYBERCOM, he was responsible for planning, coordinating and conducting operations and defense of DoD computer networks as directed by USSTRATCOM. As the Director of NSA and Chief of CSS, he was responsible for a Department of Defense agency with national foreign intelligence, combat support, and U.S. national security information system protection responsibilities.*

[https://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/general-keith-b-alexander](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/general-keith-b-alexander)

# Topical. ‚úÖ

As I am sure you all have noticed, once one industry leader blazes a trail, all their little competitors seem to follow suit. (See TSLA -> NIO -> XPEV -> MGNI)

So my DD is quite a simple one, Palantir is blazing the trail and these guys are just a mini Palantir.

I think there is a real chance this stock sees some major movement in the coming days. I wouldn't go balls to the wall and dump your whole portfolio in. I would recommend you just put a little play money in to see what happens.

# Cool name. ‚úÖ

Plus, their name is pretty fuckin cool. Telos has something to do with some Greek gods and a philosopher or some shit.

# Room to moon. ‚úÖ

TLS has a current market cap of about $1B and Palantir is on track for $35B.

# Priced like a McDouble.  ‚úÖ

These guys did 159.22 million in revenue last year. With a roughly 1B market cap they're only trading around 5x annual revenue. Compared to our dearest Palantir... trading around 47x last years revenue?

&#x200B;

**Caution:**

I want to add a cautionary note, these guys are NOT in the same league as Palantir, and I am in no means trying to suggest that they are. Instead, I just think these guys are a very cheaply priced company that looks and smells like Palantir.

&#x200B;

Happy hunting folks.

Time to print some NIU tendies,0.89,"Listen up autists.  We all know EV stocks are on fire right now.  Yet the pump has not been equally distributed.   We Americans need to drive cars because we've morbidly obese after slurping up tendies for every meal in our mom's basement.   So we forget that across most of Asia that scooters, not cars, are by far the most numerous type of vehicle.

Introducing NIU. this company is growing fast,  has the same governmental promotion for EVs, and doesn't have anywhere near the same valuation as LI, NIO, and XPENG.  Market cap is only 2.5 billion for over 450k electric scooter deliveries so far this year.   

You want growth?  This company is growing 40% YoY.  It gets better.  They're actually profitable despite being founded the same year as NIO.

Let's do some math.  Nio has 660m q3 revenue versus 100m q2 revenue for NIU.  Nio market cap is 60 billion versus 2.5 billion for NIU.  Let's be conservative and say the price/revenue multiple for NIU should be only half of NIO due to lower growth.  That means NIU should be worth 4.5 billion - 80% up from where it is now.  

As an extra bonus, Q3 earnings are expected Monday so it's time to load up before they smash expectations and rocket to the moon. This is as close as you can get to free tendies.

"DD: RIOT, MARA, MSTR and CAN",0.69,"Greetings, fellow autists, if you missed out on NIO and PLTR, here‚Äôs the next play! We‚Äôre riding the cribtoe wave this time. If you haven‚Äôt heard the news, shillcoin is close to reaching its 2017/2018 ATH, so instead of buying that shit coin ourselves, we‚Äôre playing companies with exposure to shillcoin.


**RIOT and MARA**: These two are involved in the shit coin mining business. As the price of shillcoin rises, so does their stock price... well that‚Äôs how it worked last time at least. If you refer back to shillcoin ATH and view the price of both tickers then vs. now, they clearly aren‚Äôt tracking the price as strongly. I‚Äôm going to chalken this up to the fact that there is less media hype surrounding shillcoin this time around. Last time when shillcoin peaked, RIOT was worth ~$30, now it‚Äôs only trading at $5. However, institutions are FOMOing into shill coin HARD recently. The shillcoin train is starting to leave the station and hype is mounting. If shillcoin breaks it‚Äôs previous ATH, you can expect MARA and RIOT to have an insane break out. 


**MSTR**: This one is slightly less risky, kinda. MSTR runs some sort of SaaS business and supposedly it‚Äôs pretty good. But their market cap is super small. The CEO is real big into the whole shillcoin stuff and has nearly $500,000,000 worth of shillcoin in the company‚Äôs cash reserve. This guy is probably more autistic than most of the fuckers on this subreddit, but I digress. When shillcoin moons, I expect the share price of MSTR to reach ~$300. 


**CAN** : Saving the worst for last, I present Canaan. CAN manufacturers shillcoin mining equipment. They also have received prior fraud allegations. They‚Äôre from China so you do the math. They haven‚Äôt been publicly traded for very long though and their currently down like 90% from ATH. Think of that retarded quote you always hear: ‚ÄúThe gold miners didn‚Äôt get rich during the gold rush, the shovel salesmen did.‚Äù

# TL;DR and Positions:

**This is a reasonably short-term bet that WYNN, which rose over 25% on vaccine news, is overextended and will pull back.**

* Dec 18 ‚Äô20 $75p and 85p
* Jan 15 ‚Äô21 $80p and $90p

https://preview.redd.it/vt2w0cvda6061.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f13f6b240e8e72e55cce658080a23f21552763c9

# Thesis, for anyone interested:

This is partially a play on vaccine exuberance (targeting cyclical/reopening names), and partially a play on Wynn specifically

***Vaccine Exuberance***

* As everyone knows, Pfizer and Moderna have recently reported stellar efficacy data on their COVID-19 vaccines. Last week‚Äôs Pfizer vaccine pump, in particular, sent cyclical names (i.e. cruise lines, airlines, casinos, AMC, etc.) soaring.
* IMO, these names went too far ahead of themselves. It‚Äôs true that the strong data is a triumph for science and signals that there‚Äôs a light at the end of the COVID-19 tunnel. However, once the euphoria dissipates, we have to confront a basic truth-: the vaccine isn‚Äôt going to be widely available until sometime in 2Q 2021, possibly later.
* For context, PFE and MRNA will apply for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), with an FDA decision expected sometime in December. But even if the FDA issues EUA, the limited doses of vaccines that are currently available will only be provided to very select populations, e.g. high-risk populations. Full approval (not EUA) for the vaccines are expected in 1Q 2021, meaning most people will not be getting vaxxed until next year.
* This means that in the short term, nothing about the cyclical names has fundamentally changed. Their businesses will continue to struggle, especially with the looming threat of additional stay-at-home orders. Further, those who have watched the market this year know that every subsequent vaccine news generally provides diminishing pumps (unless it's something new altogether, like the Pfizer/Moderna efficacy data). **I believe that the recent pump in the cyclicals was built on euphoria that will fade in the coming weeks.**

***Wynn***

* Disclaimer: if you think the thesis above makes sense, **you might also consider playing names like CCL and AMC**. I personally chose WYNN for a couple of reasons-:
* The stock has been hovering in the $70-75 range for a while (since April 8, it has closed below $70 only thrice). I consider the recent runup to $100+ way too much given that no material news was released by the company specifically.
* Nevada is having a hard time with covid right now. On Nov 10 Governor Sisolak advised citizens to stay at home for 2 weeks, giving them the [ultimatum](https://www.tahoedailytribune.com/news/sisolak-gives-nevada-2-weeks-to-get-virus-under-control/) that if things don‚Äôt get better, ‚ÄúI will be forced to take action in 14 days,‚Äù he said, although he mentioned that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to take enforcement. I want to lift restrictions.‚Äù
* Yet the [usual facts abound:](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/nevada-coronavirus-cases.html) cases are at an all time high and continue to grow, while hospitalizations are rising as well. I expect that this trend continues post Thanksgiving.
* Clearly shutdowns and business restrictions are unpopular, but the [latest news](https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/sisolak-restrictions-to-slow-spread-of-covid-19-coming-very-soon-2186014/) is that Sisolak might take some sort of action soon. **Any talk (or action, of course) of shutting casinos down may send Wynn spiraling back down.**
* (Sidenote: Puts on LVS, CZR, MGM seem viable too, but Wynn has run up the most)

***Several Counterarguments/Things That Can Derail This Trade***

* It is unclear that casinos will close down again. From the [same article](https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/sisolak-restrictions-to-slow-spread-of-covid-19-coming-very-soon-2186014/): ‚Äúin responding to other questions about potentially keeping casinos open, the governor said he doesn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúshut down all of the economy if we can avoid it.‚Äù
* In fact, Sisolak has [encouraged tourists to continue coming to Nevada](https://news3lv.com/news/local/tourists-welcome-in-nevada-locals-asked-to-stay-home-for-two-weeks). There is pressure to keep businesses open, so he may not bend the knee for shutdowns.
* Additional good vaccine news (particularly an EUA approval) might send all the cyclical names rocketing up again, and Wynn would be no exception.
* J Pow turns on the money printer and massacres all puts.

***Positions***

* I‚Äôm thinking that a stream of bad news will overshadow the good news in the next few weeks. That said, December puts are a little risky because the timing will probably coincide with further good vaccine news, so slightly smaller positions here. The bulk of the position is in Jan puts as you can tell.
* For strikes, I just chose a few that make sense to me, along with a speculative $75p. I reinforce once again, with some exceptions, Wynn does not stay below $70 for long, so if the stock does drop bigly, I will be cashing out before it teases low $70's.

Led Zeppelin‚Äôs Stairway To Heaven is about a woman on WSB NIO 420,0.75,"There's a lady who's sure
All that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there she knows
If the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Oh oh oh oh and she's buying a stairway to Heaven
  
 (She obviously thinks she‚Äôll be able to YOLO it to the top) 


There's a sign on the wall
But she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings

(She‚Äôs on WSB daily to get her DD, trying to find the best play)


There's a feeling I get
When I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen
Rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who standing looking

(China‚Äôs to the west of US... something about COVID)


And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn
For those who stand long

(YOLO all on NIO and go long)


And the forests will echo with laughter
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
Don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen

(People will die and in May we shall have the vaccine)

Yes, there are two paths you can go by
But in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

(You can continue to YOLO on weeklies or YOLO long on NIO)

The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?
And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

(The lady stumbles upon this solid NIO DD)


And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold

(She goes long on NIO, and it moons $420)


And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven

(She diamond handed, held fast and didn‚Äôt roll out her YOLOs and is a WSBillionaire)

Sumo Logic (SUMO) 

Earnings date: 12/7 After Hours

Closing price (11/18): $19.01

https://preview.redd.it/dp2dkg2gw2061.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=85327d356d29999fad27b8756a21635efa096ec7

Quick Facts:

* SUMO is growing quickly and is positioned well to compete in a $50B-$80B market.
* Cloud native DevSecOps platform is gaining more traction.
* \~8.2 P/S (significantly lower than competitors).
* Peaked at $28.45 right after IPO.
* CEO stated they are making progress with sales channels that are targeting CISOs (Chief information security officer) due to their holistic approach.  (Link to presentation at the bottom)
* Option volume is overwhelmingly bullish. 
* Tiger Global Management has an excellent track record or picking winners and they own over 5 million shares, which is \~5% of SUMO. (Take a look at their holdings, link at the bottom)

Cons:

* Article in Barron cited slowing growth due to shrinking IT budgets as a significant challenge for SUMO. 
* CEO leaves something to be desired. He has a good track record of positions, however, it seems that he has had a difficult time convincing Wallstreet. 
* SUMO has not received much press the last month. The market we are in feeds on press. 

&#x200B;

Final Thoughts:

SUMO is perfectly positioned for a run up to earnings. It is currently trading at a discount and could easily take off. Some respectable whales have taken large positions. Low public float (est. 50m shares) means that is could go up very quickly. It has strong revenue growth and has been significantly hurt by the little press that it has had. Analysts have price targets ranging from $24-31. If we see anything close to the post IPO price, this will be a big win. Any thoughts or additional DD will be appreciated!

&#x200B;

Scenario 1: SUMO gains over the next two week to $23-25. I will sell half before earnings in scenario 1.

Scenario 2: SUMO continues to trade flat between $18.75-$21.00. In this case I will hold through earnings but I will buy OTM 12/18 puts to hedge my calls.

Scenario 3: Flat until earnings, flat after earnings. Diamond hands through earnings. Sell for 50-60% loss. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR SUMO has earnings on 12/7. It is trading at a significant discount to its peers. A little bit of good press could send this thing up to $25+ before earnings. 

Position 12/18 $17.50C

Edit Update 11/24: sold enough of my position to break even. Letting the rest ride.

Edit Update 11/30: sold the rest of my position. Ended up about 90%. Will buy back in if it drops a few dollars before Wednesday.

Edit Update 12/7: opened a small position of 12/18  $25P after seeing what happened to SPLK. Left money on the table with calls I had. Still better than diamond handing my way to a loss.

Edit Update 12/7: sold my puts for a 200%+ gain. I‚Äôm likely done with positions in SUMO and will stop actively following for now. Overall had a 100% total gain. Could have made triple that if I had held on either direction. Hope anyone who opened a position got out early enough to make some gains.",2020-11-18 23:12:29

Tomorrow, and the following week we'll see price target updates from everyone and everyone will turn bullish. Refer to the third post as to why FuD will no longer be spread and everyone turns into a bull.

"For those of you sick of NIO spam, a real option trade with CORT",0.88,"Corcept therapeutics was recently initiated as a buy with a price target of $22 by H.C. Wainright a.k.a. people smarter than me.

A Q2 earnings beat and Q3 earning miss has left the IV of this months options sky high with no more catalysts between now and the option expiration date of 11/20. If you have buying power this means you should be selling the over priced options.

As it currently stands, a $15 put can be sold for 1.30. For the brain dead, stimulus check yoloing retards that have flooded this sub, that means you risk $1,370 for an immediate payday of $130.

When the options expire worthless on Friday you keep your money and lose nothing. Unlike buying ridiculously out of the money puts, the worst case scenario is you buy a put to cover, or receive the stock and hope it goes up.

With no earnings until February and no FDA rulings there are no catalysts to justify these option prices. [FDA tracker](https://www.fdatracker.com/fda-calendar/) to further prove there are no catalysts.

TLSA vs ChEV: XPEV target price raised to $57.71 by Citi. NIO target price raised to $60 by Credit Suisse. TSLA latest target price is $400. COME AT ME BRO,0.82,"TSLA vs Chinese EVs (""ChEV""):

**Puts on TSLA's market share in China**

TSLA surged to highs based on strong sales revenues that actually came from its China consumer rebound sales and US investor cult stock enthusiam. But TSLA is lagging behind the competition in China. It's even being outsold by even US car companies's EVs in China:

* [Electric Car Sales More Than Double In World's Biggest EV Market, But Tesla Lags, IBD 11/11/2020](https://www.investors.com/news/electric-cars-china-sales-double-october-2020-tesla-trails/)

> Electric cars again outpaced traditional vehicles as China auto sales continued their pandemic rebound in October. But Tesla (TSLA) trailed both Chinese car giant BYD (BYDFF) and a General Motors (GM) joint venture in the world's biggest market for electric vehicles....

Demand for TSLA's EVs are below its production capacity (which is probably why they dramatically cut the selling price of its cars)

> But while Tesla was No. 2 in terms of October production, trailing only the SAIC-GM Wuling joint venture, it was No. 4 in terms of October sales. That underscores that local Chinese demand is far below production capacity.  

Its established competitors are well backed by US deep pockets/car majors

> Tesla sold 12,143 electric cars in China in October, as a new price cut helped buoy demand. But Tesla trailed the GM-SAIC Wuling joint venture, Warren Buffett-backed BYD and another SAIC unit. Tesla also exported about 10,000 made-in-China Model 3 cars to other countries, after saying it would start exports to European markets on Oct. 20.  

TSLA is also lowering its goals and promises in the US, cutting out the $35K Model 3, which has a history of over-promising and under delivering. It was promised in 2017, finally arrived in 2019 and is already being cut from the lineup. This is from a company with such deep pockets due to over-capitalization from its loving retail investor base that it's worth more than the Saudi family's collection of London flats. 

* [https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/the-much-hyped-35000-tesla-model-3-is-dead/](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/the-much-hyped-35000-tesla-model-3-is-dead/)

> The really cheapest Model 3 only lived for a few months, and Tesla sold a workaround option after that -- but not anymore... Electrek reported Monday, citing unnamed sources, that it's no longer possible to order the entry-level Model 3. Though, if we're being totally factual, the actual $35,000 Model 3 went away a long time ago.

**Pressured by NIO**

Chinese EVs are now gaining on TSLA, as well. According to its earnings report last night, NIO delivered 5K cars in October to TSLA's 12K cars, and unlike TSLA, there's demand that supports its production. There is strong demand for its cars.

> Starting from October 2019, ES6 has ranked as the top-selling SUV across all EV sectors in China. For the first half of this year, ES8 has also achieved No. 1 in sales among mid- to large-sized luxury electric SUVs priced above RMB 400,000 in China.

**Nowhere to go but down**

Being added to the S&P 500 isn't a great thing for TSLA (or the S&P 500). They both have the same problem: inflated values with nowhere to go but down if the gov stops propping up stocks with new injections of money, fed buying and/or fiscal stimulus. If anything TSLA was a relatively safe haven from volatility as its unrealistically loyal retail customer base was supporting it at a more stable level than the indexed companies have been at, as indexed companies do go up and down as passive investors put money into index funds and pull money out. Make no mistake, this is why S&P Global finally added TSLA to the index. 

**ChEVs solid growth story, analyst ratings**

Analysts agree with the ChEV ""bubble"" more than they agree with the TSLA ""bubble"".. because the ChEV's aren't in a bubble. They are growing at a fantastic rate. They are all currently trading under their most recent price targets and so are values.

* [Did Credit Suisse just raise NIO's price target to $60 overnight?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/jwctqg/price_target_60_credit_susse/) 

Did Credit Suisse raise NIO's price target overnight? Who knows, we need confirmation of this SS. But what is clear is that analysts project its price target to be $150 if it exported to Europe & the US, as NIO is moving to do

* [Strong International Expansion to Drive NIO Stock to $150](https://investorplace.com/2020/11/strong-international-expansion-to-drive-nio-stock-to-150/)

> The key to NIO stock unlocking big returns from here lies in the company's ability to replicate its success all across the globe... To-date, no one has really talked about NIO‚Äôs ability to expand internationally, and potentially replicate its China success at a global scale.  

> My previous modeling ‚Äî which assumed NIO dominated the premium electric vehicle market in China alone ‚Äî produced a long-term price target for NIO stock of $60. But, after accounting for international expansion opportunities and assuming NIO does fairly well in non-China premium EV markets, my modeling now produces a long-term price target for NIO stock all the way up at $150.

**When it comes to interpreting trading action of a ChEV stock, you have to follow the basket**

US investors get too distracted by the daily trading moves of one out of a basket of ChEV stocks, making them prime suckers for smart options traders. ChEV investors who are really investing in this sector have a basket of stocks that they focus on, and the daily price moves of any one stock like NIO don't mean jack to us. While you all were being distracted by NIO's potential for spiking up and down on an earnings report and are drawing wild conclusions about it being relatively flat afterward, this is was I was focused on yesterday and the day before:

* [KNDI up > 50% in the past few days](https://finviz.com/publish/111820/KNDIc0dl0806.png)  

NIO already got its price bump from earnings week at the same time XPEV, LI & NIO all rocketed up last week. All you're seeing this week is tail action... while ChEV investors are following KNDI.

You can't focus on just one ChEV stock if you want to understand how any particular ChEV is trading. 

Here's my current basket:

* XPEV  
* NIO  
* LI  
* NIU  
* KNDI  
* CBAT

And also check out CBAT's crazy üöÄ in the past few days as well. 

Because most US investors get misled by not following the ChEV stocks the way they should be followed, WSB can make money off their mistakes and misreadings. 

Also, you may want to stop obsessing over TSLA, because IMO the obvious crazy money left to be made of TSLA is by ppl who get their puts in early instead of riding that stock down. Is it even better than a HOLD right now?

Literally the only pro wiling to go out on a limb and neg the ChEVs are the hack who shorts stuff using hack analysis, Andrew Flake, who is an actual real world cuck whose wife's boyfriend is a ChEV investor.

Electric Car Maker Nio Beats Q3 Forecasts,0.75,"https://www.investors.com/news/nio-stock-nio-earnings-q3-2020-after-li-auto-xpeng-mixed/?src=A00220

**Nio Earnings Report**


**Estimates:**

Wall Street expects the electric-SUV maker to lose 15 cents a share vs. a net loss of 33 cents per share a year ago. Revenue is seen jumping 144% to $628 million.

**Results:**

Loss of 12 cents a share on revenue of $666.6 million. Vehicle margin expanded to 14.5% from -6.8% a year ago and 9.7% in Q2. Available cash more than doubled from Q2 to $3.3 billion in Q3.

Nio had already disclosed that Q3 deliveries surged 154% to 12,206 vehicles, surpassing the high end of its own guidance. October deliveries also more than doubled year over year.

Also in Q3, Nio began deliveries of the new, more affordable EC6 electric crossover and launched its car ""battery-as-a-service"" business.

**Outlook:**

Nio sees Q4 revenue of $921.8 million-$947.9 million, above consensus for $742 million, and deliveries of 16,500-17,000 vehicles

     Unfortunately, this implied volatility crush catches many options trading beginners off guard. Buyers of stock options before earnings release is the most common way options trading beginners are introduced to the Volatility Crush.

     Not only are they shocked to find out that they didn't make any money on their option - even though the stock went in their favor - they lost all their money!

The Earnings Paradox,0.6,"Hey guys I have a theory that I'd like to present:

Earnings will generally cause a stock price to drop. Sound crazy? Let me explain:

Suppose a company beats expected earnings. The value of that company goes up, and the share prices should go up. But the amount of people looking to capitalize on these strong earnings by selling the stock will drill the stock back down, perhaps even lower than it was pre earnings. We saw this quite a few times this fall (I wish I could remember the stocks I saw this with but I'm sure a few of you also noticed this).

Now of course, if a company absolutely blows their earnings expectations out of the water, and it causes a lot of people to jump on board out of FOMO, the stock would have a lasting increase due to earnings date. But considering how accurate earnings expectations are these days, I don't see this happening very often.

I can already hear all the counter examples and people hating on this post. But that's okay, this is a discussion.

POSITIONS: Sold all but 1 share of Nio today. Will buy in if price dips. I can hear the hate coming, but listen: It's better to sell too early than too late.",2020-11-17 20:01:01

Cramerica - the retail investor is buying even ATH - load up them calls,0.58,"So, in short, on Mad Money last night, cramerica was in rare form, calling the market irrational, and highlighted the chart on DIS.  In looking at the price, effectively he stated that you never knew the world was in the middle of a pandemic.  If you have roku, just load up cnbc, and watch the segments, his dissertation of sorts leads one to believe that irrational behavior can ONLY be described if an irrational person acts rationally.  In short, retail has come to the rescue, NOT THE FED, and retail is buying high, and buying higher.  Call it FOMO, but there is rationale here.  Really you can make a market like this work if and ONLY if we are willing to buy at any level.  

Takeaway, calls!  You can get on your high-horse with technicals, and that's all fine and good.  Stop looking at valuation, don't think too hard, just think what this forum can do.  Who needs the value shift, just need to be willing to buy.

So, I was wrong.  Inclusion happened early which makes sense.

Normal inclusions are 3-10 days.  Never in the history of S&P has an inclusion been announced 35 days prior like Tesla.

But, also never in the history of S&P included a company as large as TSLA.

Stock split caused a really nice rally for a couple weeks which was unfounded on solid grounds.

S&P inclusion will buy up 10% of all available float shares (shares that are ""for sale"" by retail etc) (not elon and other people who won't sell)

Over 120,000,000 share will need to be bought by the inclusion date, AND NOT SOLD.  They basically turn into non-float shares which takes them out of rotation.

My suggestion: BUY TESLA IN ANY FORM POSSIBLE

shares, calls, LEAPS, whatever.  The only stipulation is to do it ASAP.  This will be a month long bleed up easily pushing us past ATH of 500 a share.

This idea is not based on fundamentals of the company, elon, or anything else.  Simply the statistics of how many shares need to be bought and how many are available to sell.

How many people in the right mind would sell at 420-480 knowing that 120million shares will be bought and held over the next month?

&#x200B;

TLDR: Buy TSLA shares/calls/leaps

stonks only go up, especially when index managers have no free will over the time constraint or how many shares they need to buy.  One month, 120 million shares, at whatever price is available.",2020-11-17 01:55:15

After TSLA split, smart money sold shares because it was clearly overbought. A lot of this money went toward fellow EV contender $NIO who is now 2.2x the price that it was when TSLA made its ATH at end of August. Eventually markets will realize that NIO is overbought, and it will most likely be this week went investors realize how sketchy this company is and how shit their CC calls are.

Smart money will pull back from NIO, and move back to the now *oversold* TSLA for a pop in the short term. IVs are currently low on TSLA so don‚Äôt miss this move.

&#x200B;

Nothing here is a revelation to anyone. The bull thesis here is that unlike NIO (fuck you Andrew), PLTR is Citron proof.

Gawker has shown that no one can talk shit about PLTR because they will literally be sued into bankruptcy. Only positive news from here on out.

Theil will litigate Citron out of existence.

In addition to his litigious tendencies, the actual product of PLTR is mass surveillance. At any moment, Theil knows the real identity of every anon, myself included. All hail overlord Theil!

Some of you have been making tons of money by inserting that big green dildo called NIO over the past few weeks (or months). However, many of you are just pathetic losers that called ‚ÄòNIO overvalued‚Äô at a $25 pricetag and full on missed the rocket that has been heading to the moon. 

What do these losers do now you might wonder? In a pathetic attempt to compensate for their lack of grown man balls that initially would have resulted in big time $$$, they make bets on shitty Chinese EV car manufactures in the hope they are the new  (undiscovered) NIO. Let me spare you the long DD story, but this will not lead to the 10 baggers you are hoping for and you are going to get burned sooner or later. But if that won‚Äôt make me rich, what will make me go to tendie town like the WSB gods have promised me? Well, good for you that you are still reading at this point, because here comes the money.

The company that will make us rich is called NIU (yes I am not kidding, Nio with an U). They make EV mopeds (scooters) and have been dominating the Chinese market since the day they started. This company is now succesfully expanding to Europe and parts of the USA. Their fundamentals are extremely good and they are beating earnings for breakfast. And guess what, the market cap of this company is only 2.5B. Meaning the room for growth is enormous, knowing that the whole of Asia is driving mopeds as a main form of mobility and they are all looking for good EV alternatives. Good thing is, there is only one proper EV moped company on the market right now which is NIU. Bonus, they are also coming up with their first electric motor, meaning the room for growth is even bigger. 23rd of November is earnings, and they are going to absolutely demolish expectations, mark my words.

I‚Äôm having all my life savings in NIU, feel free to do the same. Unless you hate money ofcourse.",2020-11-16 19:17:32

The Ultimate NIO Play,0.71,"Alright you autistic fucks,

A lot of you are probably too retarded to understand this but for the autists out there with a few brain cells left, hear me out. I'm late to the game with NIO and I wanted to hop on the bandwagon but premiums are through the fucking roof and I really don't want to get cucked by IV crush post-earnings. So, I've been trying to think of a play that neutralizes vega but still gives me upside... and here it is. I don't know the technical term for what this is but it's essentially a 2-sided ratio spread. 

[-2 DEC35P, +1 DEC38P, +1DEC60C, -2 DEC70C](https://preview.redd.it/6grzeouidjz51.png?width=1868&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfef41a226e84494271c5fc8219bbdd0c9c5f3ea)

As you can see from the chart, there's a huge spread on BEPs and you still have a really decent credit ($320 per contract) if NIO doesn't blast off this month. NIO launches +50%? Awesome, you're making $1000 per contract now. NIO sells off? You still profit all the way down to $29 - and if it drops below $29 what do you do? Take delivery! You now own 100 shares for a 37% discount!

The question is, what if NIO doubles this month? Well you still break even. BEP is around $83. If you are a super bull and think >100% is going to happen before Christmas.. well just buy lottos. But even if you want to go that route you can add the put ratio spread to your play (The left side of the chart) and pocket the premium!

This play can be used by the bulls and even you gay bears. Literally can't go tits up.

Play for regular autists: -2 DEC35P, +1 DEC38P, +1DEC60C, -2 DEC70C

Play for bears:  +1DEC60C, -2 DEC70C

CLEAN TECHNOLOGY.  His wife left him for a fund founder specializing in renewable energy.

VantagePoint has recently acquired a large stake in Chinese EV industry.  

All these years little left nut Andy has been planning this move to take revenge and win back the adoration of his kids.

""Andrea was engaged to be married to another man just six months later"" after their divorce.

Not only that, Andrea didn't get officially re-married to her BF in order to continue cucking Andrew into paying 50k per month in child + spousal support.  She had a wedding, but didn't officially file for a new marriage certificate in order to keep cucking micro peen Andrew. 

""When reached for comment, Andrew had only this to say: ‚ÄúI got screwed. No one knew she wasn‚Äôt married. I feel wronged.‚Äù

Considering Citron doesn't even allege fraud from NIO, we have the true motive right here!

@SEC time to take a closer look ehh?

@NIO please file suit and fight this in US courts.  He's already banned from the Hong Kong Exchange for similarly spreading lies.  With your help NIO, you can finally put the nail in Citron for good.


On the one hand this gives us all a dollar cost average opportunity.
On the other hand, Citron cannot just spread false rumors and allegations with impunity.  We need to protect the integrity of our markets, and more importantly our Calls.  NIO to the mooon üöÄüöÄüöÄ

To all my fellow call holders, stay strong.  May you find solace in knowing Andrew is still getting cucked hard by his wife's bf.  The bf is a billionaire TSLA investor, and made Andrew lose big on his TSLA shorts.  Additionally the billionaire bf got a court order to force Andrew to pay for half of his new Beverley Hills mansion. https://nypost.com/2017/12/12/tycoons-battle-over-kids-37k-a-month-child-support-payments/",2020-11-16 03:30:05

The Fed is loaded to the tits with these dumbass securities called US Treasuries. Just fucking dump that garbage at a very gradual and steady pace and replace them with OTM calls.

"Which one of you got put in charge of the largest U.S Pension? CALPERS buys hundreds of thousands of shares in NKLA, NIO, and ZM",0.87,"The largest public pension in the U.S. by assets increased its bets on makers of electric vehicles, and a videoconferencing stock in the third quarter.

California Public Employees‚Äô Retirement System, or Calpers, raised investments in Nikola Ôøº (NKLA) and NIO Ôøº (NIO) in the period, and nearly doubled an investment in Zoom Video Communications Ôøº (ZM). It also edged up an investment in Tesla Ôøº (TSLA). Calpers disclosed the stock trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The pension, which manages nearly $400 billion in assets, declined to comment on the investment changes.

Calpers bought 205,792 more Nikola shares to end the third quarter with 261,546 shares of the maker of trucks powered by alternative fuels. The pension had bought in a volatile period for Nikola stock. Shares have fallen in the second half of 2020, plunging 70% in the third quarter alone, and slipping 3.4% so far in the fourth quarter.

A short seller‚Äôs report in September alleged Nikola management overstated its internally developed battery and fuel-cell capabilities. The company disputed the report and called it misleading. Another negative report in November alleged that Nikola had considered using customers‚Äô deposits to fund Nikola One, a truck in development that will be powered by hydrogen fuel cells. Nikola also denied that allegation.

NIO, a Chinese maker of electric-powered vehicles, has seen its American depositary receipts multiply 11 times in value this year, and have more than doubled since the end of September. Those gains far outstrip the 11% year-to-date rise in the S&P 500 index, a broad measure of the market. Since the end of September, the index has gained 6.6%.

J.P. Morgan issued a bullish note on NIO ADRs in mid-October, and the company‚Äôs deliveries were strong that month. We have noted that trading volume in NIO ADRs is at elevated levels.

Calpers bought 381,439 more NIO ADRs to end September with 2.3 million.

The pension also added 312,406 Zoom shares in the third quarter, lifting its investment to 653,764 shares.

Zoom stock has surged nearly 500% in 2020, including a 14% slide since the end of the third quarter.

The advent of Zoom and videoconferencing has left televisions behind, we have noted. The company announced in October that it will begin collecting communications taxes in certain states. Zoom stock slipped last week on a sign that a coronavirus vaccine could be available soon.

Calpers bought 38,373 additional Tesla shares in the third quarter to edge up its holdings to 1.69 million shares.

Tesla stock has rocketed nearly 400% this year through Friday‚Äôs close, including a 4.8% slip since the end of September.

The electric-vehicle giant‚Äôs earnings have been strong. There has been speculation Tesla stock could join the S&P 500. Recently a prominent investor blamed a mania for Tesla stock for hurting his short position in the shares.

Meme! Stocks! Update!,0.91,"TLDR: [Don‚Äôt let your memes be dreams](https://twitter.com/litcapital/status/1268987718098391041).

GameStop: Still waiting on a catalyst, but [IV is surging](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/implied-volatility-surging-gamestop-gme-133901115.html). When GME first started making its rounds, every post had a target date of January. This target is still good as we will see Black Friday sales as well as GME earnings and Christmas sales as well. There is bound to be a catalyst. Check out options activity for clues. A lot of deep ITM puts ‚Äì someone is accumulating GME shares.

EV Gang: Looks like a great run, but I saw multiple WSB commenters arguing that NIO stock was fairly valued because they would be more productive than Tesla in 2032. If you are pricing to perfection for the next 12 years to justify today‚Äôs price, then it may be a good idea to take profits.

Vale: Dead meme ‚Äì last post mentioning this company. However, if WSB is so confident on EVs, it may be better to sell shovels during a gold rush.

Palantir: Wow! Amazing price action! Great numbers on their recent earnings report and institutions are waking up. I don‚Äôt see any direct catalysts through December, but we may see sustained demand since large institutions had to compete with a direct listing rather than a traditional IPO. (Soros is in it to win it!)

PG&E: yes, many have all been burned on this one! However, strong buying has commenced, and it looks like we are seeing a run up. A president Biden would bail out California and PG&E.

Clang gang: Gonna be a while on this one. Markets are still discounting current prices on future earnings for gold and silver miners. We are going to see a huge increase, but the powers that be are working overtime to keep this down. I am well over 50% return on my GDX, GDXJ, and AG holdings due to CCs. Get paid to wait!

Tanker Gang: You held through the darkest night. Now is when demand may finally recover. We are looking really good on STNG, DHT and EURN. Remember that a supercycle works on a multi-year time horizon. I will bet that STNG hits $12 by early next year just because their CEO is a madlad who probably doesn‚Äôt want his options to expire worthless.

Vix: UVXY is cheap, buy shares and sell CCs in the event that a correction takes a bite out of your meme stocks!!!

Gay Bear Gang: FAANGT stocks were the market leaders through the Covid recovery. It has been a while since these stocks hit their high and it looks like they are stumbling. These are early signs of a faltering bull market.

What you retards don't understand about China's EV market,0.76,"Okay fellow retards, listen up. Like you, I'm sick and tired of all these fucking posts about $NIO. A lot of people have made a lot of money, but it's soared too high too fast, and we're all late to the party. So, like you, I'm looking for the next $NIO. Personally, I don't think it's any of these 3rd-tier EV companies that everyone seems to be piling on at the moment. $FSR could be promising, but until they're actually producing, it's going to reach its ceiling pretty fast.

The thing that folks seem not to understand is that China's mandate for electric vehicles goes far beyond these niche companies that are getting so much hype at the moment. Mark my words, neither $NIO, $XPEV, or $LI will gain a significant portion of China's EV market. That isn't to say that one or more of them won't succeed, but the speculation is just out of control. The bubble may not pop tomorrow, next week, or ever, but I think it will. China's largest manufacturers have the infrastructure to pump out way more vehicles to meet Pooh's quotas, and they are already doing so.

As far as I know, these larger companies aren't being traded. So, what's an autist to do with their monies? Enter CBAK, a Chinese lithium battery producer. (EDIT: mods, intending this post to open a discussion about this and other plays that might be flying under the radar rather than push CBAK specifically, please don't delete!)

In late September, they announced that they'd produced a tabless lithium battery that supposedly has a 25% increase in energy density at 20% less cost than Tesla's, their only real competitior. In fairness, I'm not completely certain whether these figures are relative to CBAK's previous battery or to Tesla's, but in either case they claim superior performance to Tesla's. They'll be rolling out this thing in Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

Their ticker seems to banned here (too small of a market cap?) but just Google it. The time to have this on your radar was last Thursday, before it jumped about 60% on Friday, but is what it is.

CBAK already has a contract with Dongfeng motors, China's 2nd largest auto maker, which has its own EV fleet. They also make batteries for Haier, a major electronics company, so there's some diversification for you. Earnings and guidance come out EOD Monday, and I expect more to be announced, upon which this thing will moon even more than it already has. It was up to $7.00 from $3.90 at the end of Thursday on no apparent catalyst, then dipped under $6.00 and then up to $6.20 after hours. Hopefully it will dip in the meanwhile, but if you're counting on it, be ready to get fucked.

Position: \~$3k shares. Blew up 70% of my account YOLOing on SPY puts before the election and counting on this and BCRX to get me back in the game. No options available, sadly.

Edit: I'm sorry guys, really thought this one would simmer down for the day leading up to ER, but up 20% premarket. Will do you better next time--actually tried to post about it before, but the banned ticker thing came up and I had to figure out a way around it. Hopefully folks sell off before/after earnings but I think this still has plenty of upside. ",2020-11-15 17:24:15

RCEP,0.97,"No, that's not a ticker. It stands for Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, its a [new trade pact](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54949260) (<-- important parts of this quoted below) between basically every major economy in the Asia Pacific region.

>The new free trade zone will be bigger than both the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the European Union. 

This is what it does. Important parts bolded:

>The RCEP is expected to eliminate a range of tariffs on imports within 20 years.  
>  
>It also includes **provisions on intellectual property, telecommunications, financial services, e-commerce and professional services**.  
>  
>But it's possible the new ""rules of origin"" - which officially define where a product comes from - will have the biggest impact.  
>  
>Already many member states have free trade agreements (FTA) with each other, but there are limitations.  
>  
>""The existing FTAs can be very complicated to use compared to RCEP,"" said Deborah Elms from the Asian Trade Centre.  
>  
>**Businesses with global supply chains might face tariffs even within an FTA because their products contain components that are made elsewhere.**  
>  
>**A product made in Indonesia that contains Australian parts, for example, might face tariffs elsewhere in the Asean free trade zone.**  
>  
>**Under RCEP, parts from any member nation would be treated equally, which might give companies in RCEP countries an incentive to look within the trade region for suppliers.**

Meaning new markets for financial services and e-commerce for companies within the bloc.

But another thing about this jumped-out at me and it was the recent Anti-trust draft legislation. Its not like the PRC, even the PLA nutjobs, to undermine some of their best companies because they're monopolies.

In context though, what they did makes sense for 2 reasons, none of which are Jack Ma:

1. Biden winning means the possibility for trade-war de-escalation. But that means leverage in various counter-veiling sectors will be important. So China is more able to pressure the US over its monopolies (Google, Amazon, etc.) if they can make the case that they've taken actions to clean-up their own act (even if they don't end-up passing meaningful antitrust legislation).
2. More importantly was *getting this fucking trade deal done*. The companies that would potentially benefit from expanding into Chinese markets need to know (or at least believe) that there will be genuine competition at some level rather than just home-field advantage for Chinese companies. So threatening anti-trust legislation to show they're serious and understand the problem could have been what helped finish the deal. But they didn't pass the law yet and the trade deal is done. So there no more incentive for China to put a lot of teeth into the final version, *if* they ever pass antitrust legislation.

These are the best answers I can come-up with for ""why now?"" aside from the Jack Ma grudge.

I don't have any positions to post yet but these are what I'm looking at Monday:

Calls on:

BABA

SE

JD

NIO (dunno if you've heard of it)

&#x200B;

I know more about geopolitics than I know about markets so I'm interested what effects you all think this is going to have. Is it priced in? Which companies win biggest?

"Load up on PLTR, big time, or you will miss it",0.94,"Institutional ownership in this company went from 1% to almost 8% within a week(because it was a Direct Listing) and looking at the price charts, their average purchase range should be around $13-15.

This gives a floor for us retail investors and speculators out there. Price is UNLIKELY to go below this floor.

More institutional ownership is quite probably coming soon. This means money.

ARK, Soros sold a stake in JPM(probably, I forgot) to jump in PLTR.

Morgan Stanley raised the price target yet downgraded the stock, I don't know if it‚Äôs a dick move from their part to try to buy it at a lower price or maybe I am just over thinking.

Long term considerations:
This company is structured in a way in which the founders would gain insane amount of money if this stock prints(KINDA like how Musk benefitted from TSLA stock price)

Plus the total control of the founders(much like lizard man Zuck have over FB) mean shareholders cannot pull any funny business. This is significantly advantageous for PLTR for the business that it is in and the groupthink prevalent among tech workers.

They still don't have any direct competitor(not that I know of) and will have a revenue of $1B+ whereas their total addressable market size is $120B(somewhere near that ballpark, I read the SEC filings when they IPOed, but forgot the numbers and since they are building more and more products could increase TAM further).

Their software is infinitely adjustable and boy have you seen their customer retention and horizontal growth rate when they make a company Palantir's customer.

If you go to their Investors Relations website, you will see the numerous ways they are helping clients. One example, an oil major would save $1B annually for using Palantir's software.

They have an almost 10+ years head start in the business and the fact that it‚Äôs so deeply entrenched with the government means it ain't gonna become bankrupt.

I mean this shit can surpass NFLX or TSLA valuations if Karp's vision and various statements are realised.

Also remember, Peter Thiel and Alex Karp do not just work for money, they already have had a boatload(literally) of money and for them to stick to a product for nearly 17 years is definitely telling.

This company probably wouldn‚Äôt enter the Chinese market or more likely wouldn‚Äôt take any Chinese government contract.

Their margins are insane(forget NFLX, AAPL, TSLA etc) when their customers enter the scaling phase and their products are sticky as hell.

Short term considerations:
There's around 80% shares that COULD be unloaded in the market in the near future in 2021(again I forgot the exact date), surrounding this event, there could be significant price volatility, but we all know no one's mad enough to suddenly sell 80% of the shares.

Regardless, a lot of employees could exercise options constantly that they received as compensations as they didn‚Äôt get the chance to do so earlier at a fair price.

They raised their guidance. And do you know what market loves the most? Raised guidance. That's why even though market sold off by retail profit takers at first then it quickly went back to where it was. Monday could be higher.

This stock probably hasn‚Äôt really discovered its true pricing because of the still low institutional ownership and employees stock options activity.

The market(by market I mean some journos and analysts) still seems to misunderstand their product and think they are a data mining company, a consultant company, a fancy government contractor for specialist software etc. It is not any of them. I will let you discover yourself what this company is. It's kind of like how some boomer analysts still think a certain company is just a car company.

How to play this shit?
I think leaps or outright buying shares(then selling puts to generate income and buy more) is the best way, regardless, this is a matter I don't want to comment too much, I have given you some insight, now you do your own thing.

Remember, this isn‚Äôt NIO, it‚Äôs a much more bigger fish than that(if they can realise their long term goals).

Some resources for you to dive slightly deep.

I spent my NIO gains on a hooker for my B-Day; found her daytrading...,0.91,"Today is my birthday, no joke. 27 . I feel kinda old and dusty.

Woke up around 12pm, skipped breakfast and spent most of the day watching YouTube videos in my appartment, waiting for friends and family members to call me as they usuaully do to wish me a happy b-day.


While the whole ordeal seems sad and depressing, well, I dont give a fuck to be honest, since COVID a lot of people have probably spent their birthdays and celebrations alone, disconnected from others. I'm still happy I have relatives to call me and remember I exist, some pees dont even have that.



Also, I'm still quite happy from the 4k$ gains I made on NIO and XPEV Friday.


I made money both on their stock and options value.



Basically for the first time ever I got to sell a stock right at the peak before it came crashing down (sold NIO when it reached 53-ish).


Hell, Im acting up hot and all but I might lose everything again this week, who knows..üòí


Anyway, to break up the loneliness, I contacted a hooker and booked with her since Id just made some disposable money and money buys you copes.


Wont go into detail but she basically scammed me;
she did not look like the pictures


sucked me with a condom on,


promised 2 rounds but only gave me 1


did not have a COVID testing machine (lol im joking)



But honestly, she was decently pretty, had a nice warm ploop and had big tits so for 160$, it wasnt so bad I guess.


She was a bargain ''cheap'' hookers, working 2 jobs to pay their bill. We still had a really nice convo after the sex.

Anyway, what really made me laugh is that when I got into her rundown appartment, the whole place was a mess, but there was this big flat screen on her desk with a bunch of graphs and stock overview. I did a snarky remark on it and found it even funniy that it was one of those Premiums Expansive Broker (those who have a bunch a of Charts, Statistics, Data Analysis and the pitch Black Screen for background).

Basically, the point of this thread is just to show you that bascially, everyone; EVERYONE and their moms are trading now, no matter their class, education level...its really funny, a decade ago, this was simply not a thing and I think with COVID and a bunch of Millenials hyping stocks left and right and easy access to Brokerage platform, (day) trading will become a serious democratized thing in the future. There is still a good possibility that Stocks will rise and fall in the same manner even after the pandemic since most people (day) trade in idiotic ways.

Anyways so just started working as a salesman at a dealership and first day there is a salesman running all over the place telling people to jump in on NIO on Friday telling them how he has calls he bought a week ago expiring in jan (saying was such a good price atm since it dropped 7% friday morning) and basically all these other people in the place are either picking up shares or contracts and im just sitting there inside dying cause this guy is literally convincing people to place 100s and 1000s on NIO claiming how he is long term and convinced its going to the moon and will be the nxt TSLA and hit 230s by next year... Eventually I chime in and remind him its a Chinese company and they are running negative cash flow on their books and was he not around for lukin shit show (mostly just trying to save some of these people from going in on the word of a dude on a company they havent even looked at)... guy is relentless with his hard on for NIO literally watch one of the BDC girls download robinhood to start trying to get into it. Personally I think NIO is going to take a huge dump on earnings but I dont have a dog in the fight so havent been watching to closely, oh as a bonus tried to discuss with the guy what his greeks were like on the calls but I dont think he even understood what I meant as he always kinda deflected. Anyways just wanted to vent to the only other people who understand how autistic people can be with opitions and how dangerous the disease of options is to spreading and ruining people",2020-11-15 04:20:53
"Hey retarded retards, put some Respek on NVDA.",0.9,"Where is the hype for Wednesday‚Äôs NVDA earnings you mother fucking idiots?? They always smash it and saw a significant sell off Friday, which created a perfect time for entry for you fucks but noooo ‚ÄúNiO GoES bRrr huh huh huh‚Äù.

They‚Äôre coming off their first quarter selling the new RTXs (which have been selling out the moment they drop). These things are butter and will continue to sell like hot cakes into the holidays. 

Their cloud computing software and AI technology is cutting edge and being used across many cloud based systems and is used by large companies like Square and Tencent. Jarvis is a mother fuckin G. If you don‚Äôt know about their AI software, look into it, it‚Äôll make your tiny PP wet.

The median price target by analysts is $590 ($58 higher than they were at close as of Friday) with multiple price targets of $700~ and after this earnings we could see several more raises and an array of bullish sentiment. 

Lastly, CEO Leather Jacket Man Jensen delivers and every time he talks, magic happens. Wall Street loves him, the vision, the products, and the company as a whole, so why shouldn‚Äôt you? 

TL;DR, can‚Äôt go tits up. Buy NVDA calls idiots.

71k YOLO $BABA 290c 02/19/21,0.97,"I was planning to wait a bit longer before entry, but I just couldn't resist as I witnessed some weird option price movements near the closing bell on Friday and honestly, $BABA is a steal at the current prices.

I'm sure most of you are aware of Alibaba ($BABA) - currently, the largest Chinese company, the Amazon of China and the NIO of e-commerce. Recently, Alibaba, along with JD.com hit record sales numbers from the Singles Day event, but despite that, $BABA's share prices plummeted due to 3 reasons: PFE's vaccine news, Ant Groups' fail IPO and China's new anti-monopoly rules. These events sent $BABA's share price from near $315 levels down to $266 in just a few days - then slowly sliding it down to $260/share (-21% drop). What was it that the investors were so fearful of which triggered this downward slide?

1. Alibaba holds a \~33% stake in Ant Group, a fintech company (largest in the world - even bigger than Stripe), was set to IPO with a $313b USD valuation. This would be very beneficial for Alibaba and the multitude of enterprises that Alibaba has stake in. Unfortunately, this move was stopped by China due to a few reasons: lack of regulation and the possible increase in monopolistic competition. Hence, they drafted some monopoly regulations for review.
2. What are these monopoly regulations and the proposals thought out by the regulators? The regulators claimed that the e-commerce market is fierce and it was merely a few products that dominate the e-commerce platforms. As a result, they believe that 1 supplier per platform would be appropriate to allow for more entrants into the market.

However, it wasn't just Alibaba who was hit with this monopoly rule. Other big players like Tencent, [JD.com](https://JD.com), Meituan and Pinduoduo were hit by these waves, but their stock prices quickly rebounded (some unphased) after the fears were quickly wiped off.

&#x200B;

While $BABA still seems to be a sinking ship after the news.

[BABA](https://preview.redd.it/bs7xv52ifbz51.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&s=6da96f6d51ff15a203318d9531c9d6748567afa6)

Guys, $BABA at these levels is a steal. This is a monster of a company that only has great outlooks for the future. I personally believe that these monopolies laws might not come into fruition because it would be incredibly difficult to provision 1 supplier per platform rule with so many merchandisers out there. One may argue that even if it does get drafted, it just means a weaker barrier to entry, so more companies will be able to bring in new products to compete against the *better* brands; thus, increasing quality, competition and customer acquisition and retention. Regulation = bearish - doesn't always equate.

Some more info about BABA for you value investors out there:

BABA's PER = 28.02, EPS (TTM) = 9.31, 717.383B MC

AMZN's PER = 91.48, EPS (TTM) = 34.20, 1.57T MC

JD's PER = 626.39, EPS (TTM) = 0.15, 139.745B MC

BABA is incredibly underpriced.

Also, I did mention this in the beginning, but what was it that I witnessed that made me enter this position? $BABA was red the entire day on Friday, bottomed at -2.5% then closed at -1.3%. It didn't see green even once. Despite that, their OTM option prices strangely rose by a lot.

The IVs on these average at around 65%, but currently they sit at 40%. Probably the near the bottom which signals for a great entry.

The fear levels were extremely high on Friday, and China will keep their ears open for public's opinion until Nov 30, so it still might be a dangerous time to enter. But I just couldn't resist after seeing those types of option activities. Fear levels dying down over the weekend and JD's earnings report that's being released this coming Monday might also show a gap up starting Monday.

Don't take this to be financial advice, but my forecast for $BABA is at least back to $310 levels before 02/19/20. You also have $BABA's earnings coming up in the 2nd week of Feb, so the IV will be insanely high this time to increase the value of your contracts even more.

Additional info regarding NIO vs Citron,0.9,"NIO triggered a short sale related circuit breaker on Friday November 13th at 14:05:03 which can be found on NYSE's website:  [NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers20201113.xls](ftp://ftp.nyxdata.com/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers_2020/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers_202011/).

Excerpt from [Amendments to Regulation SHO (Release 34-61595)](http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2010/34-61595.pdf):

>By not allowing short sellers to sell at or below the current national best bid while the circuit breaker is in effect, the short sale price test restriction in Rule 201 will allow long sellers, who will be able to sell at the bid, to sell first in a declining market for a particular security. As the Commission has noted previously in connection with short sale price test restrictions, a goal of such restrictions is to allow long sellers to sell first in a declining market.   
>  
>A short seller that is seeking to profit quickly from accelerated, downward market moves may find it advantageous to be able to short sell at the current national best bid. In addition, by making such bids accessible only by long sellers when a security‚Äôs price is undergoing significant downward price pressure, Rule 201 will help to facilitate and maintain stability in the markets and help ensure that they function efficiently. It will also help restore investor confidence during times of substantial uncertainty because, once the circuit breaker has been triggered for a particular security, long sellers will have preferred access to bids for the security, and the security‚Äôs continued price decline will more likely be due to long selling and the underlying fundamentals of the issuer, rather than to other factors.   
>  
>In addition, combining the alternative uptick rule with a circuit breaker will strike the appropriate balance between our goal of preventing short selling, including potentially manipulative or abusive short selling, from being used as a tool to exacerbate a declining market in a security and the need to allow for the continued smooth functioning of the markets, including the provision of liquidity and price efficiency in the markets. The circuit breaker approach of Rule 201 will help benefit the market for a particular security by allowing participants, when a security is undergoing a significant intra-day price decline, an opportunity to re-evaluate circumstances and respond to volatility in that security. We also believe that a circuit breaker will better target short selling that may be related to potential bear raids and other forms of manipulation that may be used to exacerbate a price decline in a covered security. At the same time, however, we recognize the benefits to the market of legitimate short selling, such as the provision of liquidity and price efficiency. Thus, by imposing a short sale price test restriction only when an individual security is undergoing significant downward price pressure, the short sale price test restrictions of Rule 201 will apply to a limited number of securities, rather than to all securities all the time. 

On Friday, November 13, NIO's share price was artificially driven down by short sellers on Friday through the tactic of unrelentingly selling at lower and lower bids. The alternative uptick rule was applied to NIO after the share price declined 10% of the previous trading day's closing price. The short sale related circuit breaker was triggered at 14:05:03. This rule prevents short sellers to sell at or below the current national best bid. 

We have reason to believe NIO will continue to trade at higher prices throughout earnings week based on the number of positions added and new positions entered by investors on Friday alone: [https://fintel.io/sob/us/nio](https://fintel.io/sob/us/nio). The duration of price test reduction starts at the trigger point of the circuit breaker and ends when markets close the following trading day. In this case, it will end after markets close on Monday. Short sellers must be prepared for a scramble to cover their positions or they will be at risk of unlimited loss.

TSLA IV at lowest point in 6 months. WSB comment volume for TSLA also at lowest volume in months. Coincidence?,0.95,"Tesla's stock price has been doing pretty much nothing for the last 2 months since the drop after the stock split. Queue ""Theta Gang Wins"" in counterstrike voice here. Anyways, it's interesting that Implied Volatility for the ticker is at it's lowest point in many many months, what's also at the lowest point? The comment volume on this sub-reddit mentioning Tesla stock.

**Here are two charts**

**Top**: The top one shows the stock price (gold line) vs sentiment & comment volume. TSLA comment volume only sitting at 4% of comments that mention a ticker (average was always 10-25%). Also for reference, on Friday, NIO reached 40% of comment volume mentioning tickers in this sub.

**Bottom**: Shows stock price vs average implied volatility for options (blue line). IV range for TSLA was always in the 80-100 range with it spiking pre-earnings to 160%. Currently sitting at only 60%! Meaning calls are at the cheapest they've been in quite some time.

Has Musk lost his luster? Or is Tesla getting ready for take-off? One thing is for sure you don't want to be buying calls when the blue line get's too high.

NIO shareholders vs Citron,0.88,"If I am understanding what the accusations are against Citron based on what happened on Friday:   
1) NIO shareholders are holding on to their shares due to the likely event of a positive earnings report that will drive the share price upwards.  
2) Citron sees this as an opportunity to create profit by means of short and distort.  
3) Citron publishes a negative outlook of NIO.  
4) Citron carries out its plan to manipulate NIO's share price on the same day as the negative publication by borrowing a large amount of shares and meticulously driving down the ask price of NIO.  
5) Citron is selling its borrowed shares to investors, who wanted to buy in to NIO before their earnings report but missed out on a previously good entry point.  
6) Citron continuously drives the ask price down with borrowed shares to the bottom of whatever dip they consider to create a worthwhile profit within calculated reason, so as to not draw unwanted legal action. Citron then sells their remainder of their borrowed shares.   
7) At this point, Citron buys back the number of shares equivalent to the number of shares borrowed at this new, artificially created lower price point and returns it.  
8) End result: Citron makes a profit at the cost of creating a micro-panic sell-off. NIO slowly regains its share price. 

Consequence:   
\[Distortion\] Hesitant investors of NIO are now second guessing their investments.  
\[Bitter-sweet\] Long-term investors saw it as a testament to NIO's strength that it began to recover after the short and distort rather than continue a downwards trend after the borrowed shares were sold off.  
\[What-if\] Had this plan never been carried out we'd have easily seen NIO rapidly climb up in share price as demand increased but willingness to sell decreased.  
\[Confirmation bias\] Anti-Chinese investors relish in their small, artificially created victory.",2020-11-14 18:08:32

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 16th, 2020.

# **Tug of war between value and growth stocks may drive the market again in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/13/tug-of-war-between-value-and-growth-stocks-may-drive-the-market-again-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> The stock market is caught between the rapidly spreading virus and the promise of a vaccine.
*****
> That is likely to drive trading in the week ahead, as it did in the past week. Investors have been weighing cyclical plays that will do better when the economy reopens fully, against the big tech and growth names that weathered the virus shutdowns in the spring and benefit from the stay-at-home trend.
*****
> In the past week, that trade resulted in a mixed performance with the Dow up 4% but the Nasdaq down about 0.5%, as investors sold off technology and communications services stocks. The S&P 500 finished up 2.2% at a record close of 3,585, its first since Sept. 2. The renewed spread of the virus by mid-week had tamped down the exuberance over news from Pfizer Monday that its vaccine has proven highly effective and could be broadly distributed next year.
*****
> The election is still uncertain though the market has responded well to the idea that a Democratic president and a mixed Congress will likely result in gridlock. President Donald Trump refuses to concede while his campaign challenges election results. Former Vice President Joe Biden was declared the presumptive president-elect last Saturday and has been moving to organize a cabinet.
*****
> # Next hurdle for market
> ‚ÄúWe largely put the election in the rear view mirror. The next hurdle for this market to contend with will be the path of the virus, and that will be the chief focus. It means a less strident rotation,‚Äù said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. ‚ÄúGrowth has actually outperformed value for the last 17 years. That‚Äôs a lot of inertia to break...If this is a pivot point, it‚Äôs a long-term pivot point.‚Äù
*****
> The surging virus is raising renewed concerns about the economy as some cities are likely to put new limits on activities to slow the spread. In the U.S. there were a record 153,400 new cases Thursday.
*****
> Besides the virus headlines, investors will be watching economic data, particularly retail sales Tuesday and existing home sales Thursday. There are a flurry of Fed speakers, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida Monday.
*****
> Retailers report earnings in the week ahead with reports from Walmart and Home Depot Tuesday and Target Wednesday. NVIDIA also reports on Wednesday.
*****
> The Pfizer news and the election outcome combined to unleash a new wave of bullishness early in the past week. Goldman Sachs, for instance, put a target of 4,200 on the S&P 500 for 2021, and JPMorgan said the benchmark could rise to as high as 4,500 next year.
*****
> # Value vs growth
> Hogan said the value play trend had actually been underway before the Pfizer news and is what helped take the Russell 2000 to close at a new high for the first time Friday since August, 2018.
*****
> Small caps in the Russell 2000 have been outperforming for the past three months. Since Oct. 1, the Russell is up 15.5%, compared to just under 6.6% gain for the S&P 500. In the past week, the Russell was the best performer, up 6% for the week on Friday, compared to the 2.2% gain in the S&P 500.

> ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs just a constant tug of war...based on what we see with the virus headlines and such. I think that‚Äôs driving a lot,‚Äù said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group. ‚ÄúWhen you get the bad headlines, you start seeing the growth stocks do well. When you get the good headlines, you start seeing the value stocks doing better.‚Äù
*****
> Hickey expects to continue seeing vaccine developments from other manufacturers. ‚ÄúSome of these high-flying Covid stocks are going to get hit as the headlines get better. We‚Äôve been rotating out of the large cap tech stocks, but we don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre necessarily going to go down, so to speak,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe just think there‚Äôs better opportunity in some of the more cyclical parts of the market. It‚Äôs more a function of underperformance than decline.‚Äù

> # A Very Good Ten

> With nearly ten trading days under its belt for November, the S&P 500 is putting together quite a month. Through early morning Friday, the S&P 500 was up just over 9% which ranks as the best first ten trading days for a month since January 1987. In the entire history of the S&P, there have only been 17 other months where the S&P 500 was up over 9% in the first ten trading days of the month, and in the post-WWII period, there have only been five.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111320-First-Ten-Days-Copy.png))**

> So, when a month starts off strong, does it usually finish that way? Or is there some sort of reversion to the mean? Unfortunately, prior experience isn't particularly consistent in one direction of the other. The table below shows each month since 1928 where the S&P 500 was up at least 7.5% in the first ten trading days of a month. Overall, the S&P 500's average rest of month performance has been a gain of 0.96%. That sounds good, but on a median basis, the rest of the month typically sees a decline of 0.2% with positive returns less than half of the time.

> In looking at the chart above and the table below, you'll notice that most of the strong starts for the S&P came during the Depression in the pre-WWII period. In 1932 and 1933, for example, there were five occurrences each year! Looking at the post-WWII period where the frequency of occurrences wasn't nearly as common, strong starts to a month typically saw a more positive but still not a very consistent trend. In the ten prior months since the end of WWII, the S&P 500's average rest of month performance was a gain of 1.27% (median: 1.69%) with gains 60% of the time.

> # November Expiration Week: S&P 500 & DJIA Stronger

> DJIA has been up 11 of the last 16 years on Monday of expiration week and Friday is up 14 of the last 18 years with an average gain of 0.56%. By the way, it is not a mistake that November Op-Ex day has the same point change and percent change in 2014 and 2015. It was triple checked and its correct. If you go out 2 more decimal places in the percentage calculation, it‚Äôs different.

> S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have not been as bullish as DJIA around or on November option expiration. S&P 500 has advanced only 17 times during options expiration week while NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have climbed only 16 and 14 times respectively over the past 26 years. All four indices have posted average losses on Monday and aside from DJIA and S&P 500 have been essentially mixed on options expiration day. Friday‚Äôs solid average gains across the board are largely due to a sizable gain in 2008. Any weakness next week could be a good entry point for new longs ahead of the historically bullish Thanksgiving holiday.

> # Week before Thanksgiving DJIA Up 19 of 27, But‚Ä¶

> DJIA has a solid track record over the last 27 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.46%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks are not as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 17 years with a median gain of 0.10%.

> S&P is up 16 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.35% and down 9 of the last 17, ‚Äì0.13% median loss. NASDAQ is up 15 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.33% and down 9 of the last 17, ‚Äì0.004% median loss. Russell 200 is up 14 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.36% and down 10 of the last 17, ‚Äì0.27% median loss.

> This sets up well for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.

> # New High in New 52 Week Highs

> As equities and other risk assets surge, a massive number of S&P 500 stocks are hitting new 52 week highs today. As shown in the chart below, as of midday 27.92% of S&P 500 stocks have reached new 52 week highs today and just one stock, Biogen (BIIB), is reaching a new 52 week low. The net reading of 27.72% is the highest reading for net new highs since January of 2018. Prior to that, you would need to go all the way back to May 22nd of 2013 to find the last time there was such a high reading.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Net-New-Highs-2.png))**

> Looking at the best-performing stocks in the index today, the list is mostly comprised of the stocks that have been extremely beaten down in the COVID economy like energy, travel, and retail/retail real estate names. Despite this, some still find themselves as some of those furthest below their 52-week highs. Take for example Carnival Cruiselines (CCL). The stock is seeing a phenomenal 35% gain just in today's session, but even at today's highs it was still well over 60% below its high for the year. It is a similar story for CCL's peer, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) which is up 27.78% but was 61.4% from its highs at its best price today. On the other hand, there are 28 stocks that have come within 1% of their 52-week highs at their high prices today. Another 80 stocks have come within 5% of their 52-week highs at their intraday highs today.

> # Big Milestone For Small Stocks

> No US equity index has reacted more strongly since Election Day than the Russell 2000 small-cap index. As shown in the chart below, the index finally broke out above its highs from earlier in the year following Monday's positive vaccine news. After that move on Monday, the Russell 2000 was up over 10% in just the last six trading days.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/1110-RTY.png))**

> In just about any other year besides 2020, a 10%+ move in the Russell 2000 would be an extraordinary move, but this year the most recent move is actually the sixth one of at least that much. In fact, coming out of the March lows, the Russell saw three six-day moves of 19.1%, 16.3%, and 14.8%, respectively. The frequency with which we've seen these 10%+ moves in the Russell 2000 over a six-day period has been unlike any other year in the Russell's history. Behind 2020, the year with the next highest total of 10%+ moves was 2011 (4) and then 2008 (3), and the most there has been in any twelve-month rolling basis is five spanning late 2008 through the first half of 2009.

> # 3 Election Charts That Caught Our Attention

> Stocks just had their best week since April, with the S&P 500 Index incredibly a chip shot away from new all-time highs. Joe Biden will be the next President of the United States, but markets are confident Republicans will maintain the Senate, and this means gridlock in Washington. Remember, gridlock is good, as it pulls policy towards compromise and avoids extremes. Also, any legislative changes to taxes, regulation, and capital gains will have meaningful input from both parties.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, a split Congress tends to mean stronger stock returns, almost ignoring whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House. The most likely outcome from the election at this point is a Democratic president with a divided Congress‚Äîa scenario that historically has produced solid S&P 500 returns of 15.9% a year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Assuming President-elect Joe Biden takes over in January 2021, it is important to note that historically stocks haven‚Äôt done as well the first and second years of a new president compared with an incumbent winning. This makes sense though, as historically voters may have chosen new leadership in part because of economic weakness, and the uncertainty of a new president‚Äôs policies could also hold things back some. If things are good, the president tends to win reelection. Things turn around significantly by the third year in office, though, if there‚Äôs new leadership. Of course, it‚Äôs worth noting that the first year of a new president has seen the S&P 500 higher recently, with stocks up nearly 20% the first year under President Donald Trump (2017) and 23% under President Barack Obama (2009).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-2-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Lastly, the strength from stocks around the election has been rather historic. ‚ÄúThe S&P 500 added 1% on four consecutive days, which hasn‚Äôt happened since late 1982,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúAlthough there are only three other times this rare blast of strength happened since WWII, it is worth noting that strong returns going out a year took place after each instance.‚Äù The bottom line: Extreme buying pressure has a funny way of resolving higher, and we don‚Äôt anticipate this time being any different.

> # 3 The Biggest Winners Are Still Big Losers

> With household names like Carnival (CCL), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Simon Property (SPG), and Royal Caribbean (RCL) all up over 20% today, more than a few people out there are probably kicking themselves for not owning any of them. But before you start ripping your hair out, keep in mind that just about all of these stocks are down (and in a big way) on the year. Of the 33 stocks in the S&P 500 that are up over 20% following today‚Äôs vaccine news, all but one of them are still down year to date. The only exception is Expedia (EXPE), which even after a 20%+ gain is still up just 18% on the year.

> In terms of sector representation, Energy tops the list with more than a third of the names (12) on the list. Behind Energy, Real Estate (8), Consumer Discretionary (6), and Financials (6) are the only other sectors with multiple stocks listed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Best-Stocks-1109.png))**

> Just as the best-performing stocks are all still underperforming the S&P 500 on a year to date basis, the biggest losers today are among the year‚Äôs biggest winners. There are 25 stocks in the S&P 500 that were down on the day as of the middle of the afternoon, but the only one that is down on the year is Biogen (BIIB), a stock whose decline has nothing to do with the vaccine news. Including BIIB, the 25 biggest losers are still up an average of 41% YTD (median: 31%). Behind BIIB, the two worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500 today are Pool (POOL) and Etsy (ETSY). Both stocks are down over 10% on the day, but for the year are still holding onto gains of 56.4% and 190.5%, respectively.

> # Policy Uncertainty Spiked Into the Election

> For the month of October, the NFIB's reading on small business sentiment was unchanged at the headline levels but many of the sub-indices broadly pointed to further improvements in business conditions. That is not to say small businesses do not have their share of concerns. As shown in the chart below, the NFIB's index on Economic Policy Uncertainty rose another 4 points in October to 98 which is the second-highest reading on record behind November of 2016; around the time of the last presidential election.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111020-NFIB-Uncert2.png))**

> The election played a role in the uncertainty as 31% of small businesses surveyed reported government-related concerns as their biggest problem in October (lower chart). That was up for the second month in a row and is around the high end of the past couple of year's range. Additionally, as discussed earlier, labor also dominates the minds of small businesses as small businesses report struggles in filling roles. 30% reported cost or quality of labor as the single most important problem (top chart). That is unchanged since August.

> # Big Tech Fades and Small Caps Soar

> Pfizer‚Äôs announcement that its vaccine for covid-19 appears to be 90% effective on Monday morning also gave new life to small-cap stocks, many of which have struggled throughout the pandemic. The announcement has also triggered an exodus from mega-cap tech stocks that had been the ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù positions throughout most of the pandemic.

> The chart above is based upon a similar chart from page 112 of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac 2020. It shows the typical one-year seasonal pattern of the ratio of the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000 from July through June (scale on right). Overlaid on top of this pattern is the performance of this ratio in 2020 so far through today‚Äôs close (left scale). When the ratio is declining, large-cap stocks are outperforming small cap stocks. When the ratio is climbing, small caps are outperforming. In a typical year, small-caps will lag until around late-September or early October and then take off right around mid-December.

> Covid-19 related shutdowns and unemployment had kept small caps essentially sidelined this year. There were bouts of strength in late-July to mid-August and a brief surge in mid-September and again in early October. The recent surge higher could be an early start to the major move higher that typically begins around mid-December.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets.",2020-11-14 17:06:33
Citron Research: what else have they called?,0.74,"Everyone has heard about citrons stance on NIO at this point. And you may have seen posts about citrons past calls that makes them look like idiots. Jumia, Shopify, and Facebook are the calls most people focus on. 2 from 2016 one from 2019. The obvious issue there? There were a lot of calls made in that 3 year gap. Cherry picking their biggest losers is something you could do with any investment house considering they make 100s of price targets a year. So in the spirit of fairness I‚Äôve put together some of their winners to show they aren‚Äôt as brain dead as some might want you to believe.

HMNY- only those that were too young to be around at the time don‚Äôt know about Moviepass. I‚Äôll be honest. I was young and dumber and holding HMNY at this time and I was so fucking pissed when citron posted this story. But now look at the stock price. You‚Äôd struggle to even find it since they switch tickers and have reverse split the stock into the ground. Still citron called it and if you listened to them you wouldn‚Äôt have a -99.99% position in your account.
https://m.benzinga.com/article/10173237

Jumia- yes one of the companies that you thought was a bad call from them was actually good if you look at what their actual price targets were. Look at jumias chart. Citron shorted them after their IPO at $50 then it dropped to $2. 2 fucking dollars. Are you telling me shorting the stock wouldn‚Äôt have made money? After the stock had lost 90% of its value and changed the board heavily. Citron changed its call to bullish. Jumia was no longer overvalued and had fixed its internal issues citron saw. So their stance changed.
https://m.benzinga.com/article/18061798

Valeant- in 2015 valeants stock price was in the $200. Citron ran a story calling them out for inflating drug prices to cook the books. Giving them a PT of $20. A year later their stock had tumbled down to $20 after several investigations were opened.

In 2015 the Wall Street journal investigated citrons previous shorts and found that on average the first year after a citron call companies dropped 42%. So basically you could get mad at them or you could get rich from them. Your choice",2020-11-14 16:52:07
[TSLA vs. Other EVs] Why Do Happy TSLA Investors Cheat on Lord Musk with Other Shitty EV Stocks in their unrelenting search for more tendies?,0.9,"Listen up you retards. 

Some of you have been enjoying a fling or two with the exotic foreigners like NIO, Li Auto, XPeng, SOLO, etc. Sure, you are a tall retard. You are just attracted to small, cute EV cars (or in the case of SOLO, retarded looking small Canadian EV with 3 wheels). They happen to be Asian but no, you don‚Äôt have a yellow fever or some kind of Asian fetish.

You retards often underestimate the emotional and financial ramifications of your actions. Papa Musk has been good to you. TSLA has made you lots of tendies in the past. But today, we are going to look into why happily invested retards like you cheat on TSLA and why that‚Äôs a mistake.

**NIO‚Äôs been making me shit load of money. I am never going back to Papa Musk**

I know it‚Äôs difficult to learn your lessons when you are retarded, but haven‚Äôt we gone through this before? You don‚Äôt bet against Papa Musk. You tried with NKLA and thought that talent-less hack Trevor Milton was some kind of second coming of messiah until you saw that fake ass video of their truck ‚Äúrolling down the hill‚Äù.

Now I am seeing that you moved onto William Li. Sure, the guy is no Trevor Milton. He seems to have the right background (i.e. education, past track record as an entrepreneur, etc). He also has right investors in NIO, such as Tencent, Temasek, Baidu, Sequoia, Lenovo and TPG. But Musk already has his trump card called Model Y and I will explain to you what will happen over the next 12 months or so.

**Chinese EV Demand**

According to Barrons, China started to crack down on gasoline cars few years back. Due to congestions and pollution in the major cities, Chinese government started limiting the issuance of license plates in China. Not only is it difficult to obtain license plates for gasoline cars (i.e. it‚Äôs almost like a lottery system), the cost to obtain one is more expensive. Then let‚Äôs say somehow you were able to obtain a license plate and was able to afford one, there is another layer of complication: you can only drive gasoline cars on certain days of the week.

But with EVs, the government makes it much easier to get an EV plate than gas plate. There is better parking, less tolls, and no restriction on driving days. This is shifting the demand to EVs because the process is much easier to obtain a plate for EVs and overall cost of ownership is lower. 

**Model Y‚Äôs Importance**

Some of you ungrateful retards may have been disappointed by the announcements from the last Battery Day. But Papa Musk, did give you updates on the future of the battery technology (which will be covered on a separate rant), but more importantly on Model Y.

Per Bloomberg, Tesla‚Äôs Chinese version of the Model Y, which will be locally made in China, will be a single biggest threat to NIO‚Äôs growing dominance in the electric SUV segment of the Chinese EV market over the next 12 months.

NIO was doing superbly lately but on Friday, Citron Research released a bearish report on NIO that increased competition from TSLA will become more intense with the launch of Model Y in China.

The biggest advantage will be the price point. When Model Y is released in China (manufacturing will begin in 2021 and delivery also expected in 2021), Papa Musk said he will lower the price to $41,000 (vs. $49,900 in US). Papa Musk also said that monthly Model Y sales will reach 30k units. 

In comparison, NIO‚Äôs ES6 SUV starts at $54,000. When it comes to economy of scale, NIO is unable to match TSLA (yet) and as result, TSLA will be able to sell their Model Y at a lower price point, which will force NIO (and others) to accept a wave of price cuts to their premium electric vehicle lineup. That means while TSLA keeps printing profit and increase their revenue, the rest will have to eat the loss until they can scale up as well. (But by then, Musk will be on another money making innovation, the Battery).

**So what does this mean over the next 12 months?**

Just a week ago, Tesla registered its Model Y with the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. This indicates the start of production in China (upon issuance of final production permit for Model Y from the government). Yes. Papa Musk said production will begin in early 2021 but it looks like he‚Äôs ahead of schedule.

Additionally, there are reported sightings of Tesla doing road tests of its Model Y in China. 

NIO, which competes in the luxury segment of the EV market in China, recently reported a new monthly sales record earlier this year, delivering 3,740 vehicles in a month. 

That‚Äôs right retards. For anyone who wants to argue that NIO will catch up to Tesla soon and match its scale, that isn‚Äôt going to happen anytime soon. Tesla can deliver 3,740 vehicles in its sleep. From the get-go, Papa Musk is shooting for 30,000 vehicles of monthly Model Y sales in China and that‚Äôs only Model Y volume. 

If that‚Äôs not the nail in the coffin, then consider the risky strategy that NIO is taking on its battery strategy. While Papa Musk is developing an entirely new battery technology that will last longer, and hold the charge longer, NIO chose ‚ÄúBattery as a Service‚Äù strategy. What is that, you ask? 

Well, one of the key battlegrounds for the success of EV market will be the ability to build and maintain a more extensive EV charging infrastructure. China and US are looking to expand its charging network (i.e. number of charging stations) and both countries are investing into this infrastructure. 

However, NIO has taken a different approach to charging, focusing on battery swaps rather than charging stations. Rather than leveraging EV charging stations (that all other EVs will use in China, including Tesla), NIO is building its own network of ‚Äúbattery-swap stations‚Äù. What this means is that NIO customers can only use NIO‚Äôs ‚Äúbattery-swap stations‚Äù where they have to buy vehicles without the battery, and instead sign up for a monthly subscription service that gives them access to battery packs depending on their needs. 

Now ask yourself. Would you rather own EV with its own battery that you can just charge wherever, or would you rather buy one without a battery, and sign up for a subscription service where you have to swap the battery at one of its swap stations?

**Conclusion: Here are the key takeaways for you retards who failed to read my rant above**

1. NIO can‚Äôt compete on scale with Tesla. They recently achieved a record monthly delivery of 3,740 vehicles while TSLA can do that in its sleep. Papa Musk is expecting monthly delivery of 30,000 units for Model Y alone.

2. Because they can‚Äôt compete on scale, Tesla can produce and sell Model Y at a lower price point. This will force Chinese EV competitors to a wave of price cuts, which will result losses for them but not TSLA.

3. Model Y is about to start production and already conducting road-tests. It is on track to launch in 2021 at $41,000 (vs. NIO which starts at $54,000)

4. NIO‚Äôs ‚Äúbattery as a service‚Äù subscription program is retarded.

5. Tesla will moon again in 2021 once you assholes come back to senses.

"NIU, get ready and preorder your lambos.",0.91,"Now the hype is all about Chinese electric cars. And rightfully so, but everyone wishes they found out about these stocks before the hype started to grow. Now of course you are wondering what stock is next up for spectacular growth. What is up next?

This is where being retarded comes in handy. Who can better predict retarded hype than a retard himself? If electric cars can get a huge pump, why wouldn't electric scooters pump too? Sounds logical right? The price of these electric car companies is getting high, retards are scared to get in but still want in on the EV hype so they look for alternatives creating the upcoming hype. I can feel it coming boys. 

Currently NIU only has a current market cap of 2,5B, compare it to NIO with a 60B market cap and the potential for growth is huge. They smash earnings time and time again, the growth is there. Fundamental differences between these companies don't matter, retard hype is stronger than anything.

Scooters are way more affordable then cars so every gay hipster will be able to buy one. Cars are getting more and more inconvenient to use in cities. Asians primarily use scooters to get around and shared scooters are getting more and more popular in and outside of Asia.

Buy calls,0.85,"I suspect Citron had built up the short/put positions leading up to this week and earlier part of this week when NIO was $37-$44, and NIO continued to surgeon the past two days, to $48 and $54 at the open today with the exceptional EV growth in China as validated by XPEV and LI, Andrew Left had to release this hit job  before NIO price gets further away from his short/put strikes. The Citron's thesis is based on a sole factor that Tesla will set the price of its Model Y where it will undercut the sales of NIO EVs. I can tell you that is totally misguided, mistaken and not aligned with facts and reality. 

Let us look through the numbers and you can draw the conclusion: NIO EVs are currently priced between 350k - 570k RMB ($53k - $95K,  $45k - $85k with BAAS), while the EVs from XPEV, LI, BYD and Tesla Model 3 are priced $250k - $400k RMB ($38k - $61k), with Model Y going from $50k to $80k. For buyers who are price conscious, there are many options in China whereby they can easily save $16k - 30k. But the reality is people are lining up to buy NIO, paying significantly more for NIO EVs, and that should tell you the price is but one factor, and insignificant factor when it comes to choosing NIO over others. NIO has built up its own EV ecosystems inside China, starting with the best EV (design, quality, technologies), comprehensive range extension mechanisms - swappable, upgradable, fast charging and mobile charging, and life enhancing / social fabric forming NIO Houses/Spaces, along with NIO Life. The pioneering BAAS remediates the anxiety over battery and affords NIO owner base cutting edge technology and advancement in battery and others. 

The proper way to look at why people choose NIO while paying more and why NIO is growing over 100% - 200% YOY is that NIO brings about a value proposition that is far and above any of its competitors, a value proposition that its competitor is unable to match unless they change their business model, and a value proposition that has been and is being recognized by more people. 

Andrew Left is in it all for a quick buck, and he is the one that got convicted by HK SEC for spreading false information and stock manipulation, and got his fund confiscated and himself kicked out HK market. Andrew Left, a guy with no moral or conscience, became concerned all of sudden that NIO price is too high. He got trapped as NIO price continued to zoom up after he opened his short / put positions, and the ER next Tuesday will easily lift NIO to above $70, judging from over close to 50% rise of EXPEV and LI after ER this week. Therefore he has to do something quick and dirty by releasing this hit job that really has nothing to try to get himself out of this bind. It is comforting to see NIO closes at $44.50, $3 higher over the close of last Friday. I bought more today with this kind of discount, and I hope and believe more traders  will jump in Monday and Tuesday to pick up more calls leading to the Q3 ER. We know NIO delivered 12205 EVs in Q3, and I am seeing NIO to guide fore 16500-17000 for Q4, and that will be another doubling YOY.

We are in a bubble bubble,0.91,"You know it's coming. You hear it on the news, you read it on boomer investing websites, Rand from sales casually brings it up at the water cooler. We're in a bubble. 

We have a student loan bubble, a housing price bubble, a tech bubble, an EV bubble, an index fund bubble (just to name a few). I'm here to tell you one thing I know to be true: we're in a bubble bubble.

**AND THIS BUBBLE IS GOING TO POP**

Just think about it, there's too many bubbles. Every day we're inundated with information carefully outlining the latest bubble we're in. We're attacked every single day with fancy graphs, actual research, and sound logic. The market cannot sustain this many bubbles.

This is clearly an elaborate scheme by market makers such as JPM and Schwabb and Macy's designed to rip us away from our hard earned tendies. But we aren't our parents, we have access to unlimited information at our fingertips and we will not be misled. 

This bubble bubble is going to pop, and once it does we will see that all the aforementioned ""bubbles"" were not true after all. We will see that stonks only do go up, and only then will we reach true enlightenment.

"4 Facts About the ""NIO Killer"" Citron Research",0.94,"Citron Research isn't some elite Wall Street consulting firm. It's a blog founded by a dude name Andrew Left. Some interesting facts about Andrew:

* Was banned from Hong Kong securities for 5 years and fined $210,000 by Hong Kong's securities regulators for disclosing misleading information. [WSJ](https://archive.fo/6V5Wj), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left)

* Once said ""My job is not to be right; my job is to generate returns."" [Institutional Investor](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1jsysj69d1xlv/Who-Needs-New-Year-s-Resolutions-After-43-Returns-Andrew-Left-Does)

*  Called Shopify an illegal company promoting a ""get rich quick"" scheme. [Citron](https://citronresearch.com/citron-exposes-the-dark-side-of-shopify/) 

* His main business model is to short stocks against companies, then publicly accuse them of fraud, then benefit from the drop in stock price. He has often been accused by securities traders and educators of committing securities fraud. [SMB Training](https://www.smbtraining.com/blog/is-citron-research-committing-securities-fraud)

As one independent research firm puts it:

>""What they seem to do quite well is they're able to spin existing facts into a horrible scenario. It reads very badly,"" and that ""Their job as a company is to create the most amount of panic so they and their clients can make the most amount of money"" [Globe & Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/who-is-citron-research/article26918763/#c-image-0)",2020-11-14 01:44:23
SCO - üåàüêª vs the Oil Market with 2x Levereged Inverse ETFs,0.5,"WARNING. SUB 50 IQ DD INCOMING

I think this is the prime week for all you bulls riding your nio calls this week to be a little curious. 

1. Major EV gains in the past month have pumped this ETF to over 19 but it is currently in a dip at under 16. Currently it's near it's 52 week low and set to rise if EVs can continue their current trajectory.

2. COVID 19 cases hit another record today. Expect fossil industries to suffer if the trend continues which means big bux if another lockdown is triggered against the travel industry.

3. NIO earnings this week may impact fossil markets if earnings boom and it continues to soar as investors buy the dip today. 

4.  I'm a retard and theres a very good chance I'm wrong. Do not hold this for too long as it is a leveraged inverse etf. 

My play: 1k in shares purchased at 15.03 a share. Sell off after NIO earnings, or if more than 15  percent losses are incurred before 20 Nov. 

Am I a retard or am I actually onto something for once?",2020-11-14 01:07:19

Call Spread Sold on Robinhood?,0.6,"A couple of days ago I purchased a call spread for NIO on Robinhood. I bought a $42c 11/13 contract and sold a $43c 11/13 contract. In total it was $.38 per share.

I figured if NIO closes above $43 I would have a profit of $62 and if NIO closes below $42 I would be out $38.

Since NIO has essentially skyrocketed since, I didn‚Äôt pay much worry. This morning NIO was above $50 but throughout the day it went down. I held onto the contract because I felt there was enough support for it to close above $43.

By 2:45pm NIO went to around $42.50. At 3:00pm today I get a message from robinhood saying they have sold my contract for $.41. Even though I was very confident it would bounce back above $43. At close NIO was above $43 and I feel like I have been cheated out of my $62 profit and instead received $3.

No... no it isn't going to make you money. Some could make the argument both companies are the same garbage, but the same argument could be made that you are retarded.

You‚Äôre fucking up. This is a change in global dynamic. NIO is poised to have 30% of all Chinese sales by 2030. So take any ICE company that had 30% at any time anywhere and look at what their valuation was. Then do a little math on what that comparison to EV in today‚Äôs climate would be with improved efficiency in manufacturing and inflation from that time to now. And BOOM you have ‚Äòinsane‚Äô valuations.

NIU - Chinese EV play Quietly Gaining Steam. Earnings 11/23,0.57,"Yes, NIU, not NIO. Can't believe I am not hearing more about this one. Chinese EV scooter play that is rapidly expanding throughout Europe and the rest of Asia. Market cap of just over $2.5 Billion and loads of room to grow. It has been a volatile one the last few weeks but it has quietly had a 20% week and volume starting to really pick up (compared to average volume that is). Also just busted through double top resistance at $32. Six month chart looks great and analyst upgrades and price target increases have been coming left and right. Earnings on 11/23 and they are predicted to be pretty solid. I expect the run-up to continue to earnings and then a possible skyrocket from there in the next few months once more people start to catch on. Seen only one post discussing this one in the last few weeks, so really a sleeper flying under the current EV radar in my opinion. Option volume is also starting to pickup big time in the last few weeks.

Long term NIO is a smart move though. My advice?

1. Don't FOMO, wait for the pullback.

2. Sell 50-75% of your calls soon, before noon if not 10:30.

3. Buy puts for next week. IV is high but this is a casino so who cares?

4. Buy in after the pull back next week w/ shares/leaps.

"[CRSR] Corsair $40c May 21, 2021 Exp",0.96,"Listen up you degenerates.

If you‚Äôve been pouting all month because you missed out on election week rally, post-Pfizer Dow rally (because you were a pussy who held cash), NIO üöÄ, or you were simply üåà üêª, then I have the play for the next stock to fawn over.

**What is Corsair Gaming (CRSR)**

Even though this company started trading publicly only a month~ or so, this is a legit company that already pulls in billion dollars in revenue. Company‚Äôs products are beloved by all the losers in your life (i.e. your loser childhood friend who works at McDonald‚Äôs and spends all their paycheck towards RH YOLO trades, weed, and video games).

This is the number one seller of high-performance computer memory, cases, power supplies, coolers and gaming keyboards as well as #2 in performance controllers and streaming gear. Per Andy Paul (CEO) in their most recent earnings call, he reported that most of their product lines maintain a top 3 US market share positions, with several number one positions according to data from NPD group.


**So what? Why should I care?**

Listen you retard. When there‚Äôs unexpected nudity during that HBO show that you watch on Sunday night, you say thank you. You don‚Äôt stop and ask, ‚ÄúMan, I thought this show was rated PG. Why is there nudity?‚Äù Similarly, when someone tells you about a promising stock that is going to double, triple, and quadruple from the current price point, you fucking listen and continue to read the wisdom documented in this long ass fucking post.

Corsair generates their revenue from two segments.

Segment 1: Gamer/Creator Peripherals.

For you retards who can‚Äôt understand big words like peripherals, this segment includes gaming keyboards, mice, controllers, headsets and other streaming equipment such as capture cards and microphones. And I am not talking about $10 mice or $20 keyboards that your broke ass buys at Staples. These are high margin, high end, top of the line gaming/computer peripherals used by those talent-less hacks streaming live on Twitch, YouTube, OnlyFans, etc for ‚Äúdonations‚Äù. Today, 71% of millennial gamers in the US watch gaming video content on streaming platforms for an average of almost 6 hours per week. There are over 6 million committed streamers in the world today who viewed over 12 billion streaming hours in 2019 alone.

The revenue in this segment spiked 129% YOY in the most recent quarter to $161.1 million. It made up for 35% of CRSR‚Äôs total revenue. This is high fucking margin business, which means Corsair is a winner that rips off those losers mentioned above. Their gross margin was 37.1% in the most recent quarter.

You know why gross margin is important? Because it measures how badly a company can rip off their customer base. You ever see Est√©e Lauder stock? That stock simply goes up. Jim Cramer talks about that company‚Äôs CEO Fabrizio Freda, aka Pringles Man (from his P&G days), aka Febreze (his name sounds like it), all the time. Why? Because that company‚Äôs gross margin is somewhere around 50-60%. They sell a $400 candle under Jo Malone brand. What kind of sucker pays $400 for a fucking candle? I have no idea, but you get my point.

Segment 2: Gaming Components and Systems.

This segment includes sales of equipment such as computer cases, RAM, cooling solutions, power supply units and pre-built gaming PCs. You know those losers with a big ass gaming desktop PCs with üåà üêª LED lights around the case? Those ü§° s spend shit load of money on these gaming systems because it makes them feel important when they play video games with other losers. The gross margin for this segment is 28%. Not too shabby.

In the most recent quarter filing, their total revenue increased 60.7% YOY to $457.1 million and the gross margin jumped significantly. Adjusted operating income increased 194% to $61.4 mil.

**Ok. So they rocked this quarter. But what about their future? What is their outlook?**

Well you ungrateful greedy f*ck, CRSR is well positioned to benefit from long term growth trends in the gaming hardware market, making it an ideal play for retards like you who can only ask questions like, ‚ÄúPS5 or the new XBOX? SNE or MSFT?‚Äù. No you retard. Those stocks are not gaming pure plays, and they are not fucking cheap. Your broke ass can‚Äôt afford them. 

CRSR can rely on the gamer and creator peripherals business to drive sustained growth in the future. Why? Because of the fast growing e-sports market. According to some smart ass industry experts, they estimate that the global e-sports market could clock a compound annual growth rate of over 24% thru 2027. That means, the demand for video game streaming equipment and other peripherals is expected to increase in the coming years, adding $2.8 billion worth of incremental revenue over the next four years in this market alone.

CRSR reportedly has 18.3% of the peripherals market today and controls 41.9% of the PC components market. The entire PC gaming hardware market is expected to add $3.6 billion in incremental revenue this year, thanks to all the losers playing games at home due to COVID. The total market size for PC gaming hardware market today is $40 billion, of which 83% was spending from competitive and committed gamers. These are true retards who will spend between $1,000 to over $1,800 on gaming hardware and accessories. 

**But the stock ran up quite a bit. Should I wait till it drops?**

The stock is still cheap. Their POS (Price to Sales) ratio is 1.91. In comparison, Logitech‚Äôs POS is at 4.3. Additionally, CRSR is currently priced at 80x trailing earnings and has a forward P/E ratio of 26. Both are favorable compared to their peers.

Because of COVID, upcoming holidays and other factors/trends that are favorable to Corsair (i.e. anticipated next generation gaming hardware/GPU to be launched by NVDA and AMD), CRSR is expected to generate full year revenue of $1.6 billion this year (which is 45% increase YOY)

- Second Wave COVID: Will force consumers to stay at home and people will need other activities apart from binging Netflix.

- Holiday Retail Sales Outlook is still positive. Gaming products will be boosted by Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Christmas shopping.

- People are upgrading their home PCs. As more people stay at home or work from home, more attention is being paid to the home PC and people are spending $ on upgrades.

They focus heavily on the higher end of the market, with product focus on performance and innovation. With gaming growing rapidly and big money flowing into this market, demand for performance is increasing. Why? Because when you suck at video game, it‚Äôs never your fault. It‚Äôs the fault of your gaming gear. So they will go out and spend more money on better shit. CRSR‚Äôs products meet the expectation of what the gamers want (i.e. speed, precision, reliability, great processing power, etc)

Although the competitive and committed gamers accounted for 83% of the $40 billion spend in the global market for PC and streaming gears in 2019, that only accounts for 18% of the worldwide total of 524 million PC gamers in 2019 with the remaining being casual gamers, who do not often rely on specialized high end gears yet. (Translation,there is untapped market of 82% among the 524 million PC gamers who have yet discovered the beauty of high end gaming stuff)

If the average spend of this group of gamers were to significantly move up going forward, then the market will also grow by multiples (for high end gaming stuff). 

This stock is currently undervalued compared to its peers like Logitech and Razor. Not only that, the current P/E ratio of CRSR is roughly 3% below the overall P/E of NASDAQ. Additionally, looking at POS (Price to Sales) and MCS (Market Cap to Sales), CRSR is cheap by discount of 57% and 45% respectively to the NASDAQ. Sales are expected to grow next year by more than 30%.

**Risks**

F*ck risks. F*ck that mindset. This company is already profitable and prints money. If you retards can blindly throw money at losers like GME and NKLA, you can throw money at a company with actual sales, actual products and actual profits.

**Price Target**

$40+ per share by May 2021. You can play the call option or you can just buy the stock.
Either way, it will get to $40 range and above once this stock‚Äôs valuation catches up with the rest of the market. By end of 2021, I expect this stock to be $70-80. Oh, and for you retards who are risk averse, this stock is considered ‚ÄúStay at Home‚Äù stocks. It will moon during the pandemic, and it will moon after the pandemic.",2020-11-13 05:53:47

&#x200B;

The Chinese government has basically come out and said ""do electric cars."" And will continue to penalize gas vehicles  while pumping money into electric car companies until it happens.

&#x200B;

It isn't like in the United States where electric cars are having to compete with gas vehicles, and then different states have different laws regarding subsidies for electric cars and every 2/4 years we have elections and the republicans roll back all of the incentives put in place by the democrats. China has one party. And that party is the Communist party. And the Communist party does whatever the fuck they want.

&#x200B;

China's single party system coupled with their command economy allows them to make unilateral decisions and execute them extremely effectively.

&#x200B;

Couple this with the fact that China has a population of nearly 1.4 billion and you can see that Chinese EV companies have a long way to climb before they run out of steam.

The fact that NIO is based in China is a GOOD thing. The Chinese government has decided that EV sales will be 25% by 2025. period. It will happen. And the 3 companies best positioned to deliver on this directive are NIO, XPEV, and LI. Its not a matter of if. EV companies aren't going to have to worry about the Chinese Communist party reversing their policy decisions and you can bet they won't have to worry about competition from gasoline vehicles with Mao looking over them.

&#x200B;

Example: in 2009 China said ""do nuclear power""

In 2009 China had 5 nuclear powerplants.

Today China has 46 nuclear powerplants with 11 more under construction.

&#x200B;

Why? Because this motherfucker said so

What I'd like to focus on is SOLO, KNDI, LI, FUV, and FSR. These stocks haven't really popped off yet but some of them show some real potential. KNDI, for example, is offering the cheapest, fully electric, fully-fledged cars in North America right now. Their K27 model is only $10k after the federal tax credit you get for buying an EV. 

&#x200B;

SOLO, on the other hand, is producing smaller, 3-wheeled vehicles that don't qualify as cars and also don't qualify for the federal tax credit, but they're still small and could prove effective in certain demographics in the US. They're also producing fleets for first responders and mail carriers which could really help.

TLDR: Retail gets cucked for \~ $ one set of ferrari tires and is completely wiped out.

Looks Like EV's are up Bigly, congrats on the tendies bulls! Even Robinhood thinks Biden is good for them how could they go down. I'm watching from the sidelines but here's some loss porn for you.  It's aged like fine wine, sorry, it took awhile for my wife's boyfriend to explain the mistakes I made in a way I could comprehend. I'm still dreaming of that up 4.7% on my whole portfolio day right at the start.

I got greedy and put 85% of my account into one positions, then held +75% DNKN spreads grasping for more tendies before the buyout news came through, but was struck down by Inspire's billions of $'s. 

Now that I have $3.36 to invest, I figured I would buy Sundial. I can't afford Aurora Puts or Canopy Calls, and Slang doesn't trade on RH. If everything goes my way I will have enough money for a preroll in 2024 when it is hopefully legalized in Texas. 

&#x200B;

And yes it was $100, but longterm even more \~ $ 7k across everything, 

Ferrari tires are \~1.75 each so the math from the TLDR checks out. See below for the rest:

&#x200B;

I started swing trading Aston Martin on TD  for $0.05-0.10  in the June when it was playing with $1 (it's down to $0.80 today) 

I thought "" wow this is easy"" until they hit me with the fees a month down the road. 

So I got a Robinhood, too and once I lost most of my money, a WeBull. That comes later. 

I started making money swing/daytrading shares, and then ""taught myself"" options.

* Panic Selling GME calls, they were profitable within 2 days and I had months,                                       
bought and sold puts and blew the remainder of the account... GUH
* Did not Buy NKLA as VTIQ, thinking it was a scam and worthless compared to Tesla                               
While this is true everywhere except the NKLA subreddit, it went to $90 and I missed it... GUH

""Dear Jamie, Please Venmo me $10,000 I promise to let it get spoofed out of me by your metals desk trading GLD options and NAK. Hope the family is well, Happy Holidays."" ###

&#x200B;

I will end with a prayer.

Dear Jerome, 

I am sorry for my sins. If I am given another chance at tendies I will approach them as a grateful bull. Buying stocks is better than selling them, that's why we have covered calls, overnight pullbacks for entries, overnight gaps for gains, and our patron saint: margin. Obviously stocks should go up, we have the technology to make them go whenever we want, I don't know why I didn't listen to the blatantly obvious signs of a Bull Market or the wise words of the oracle himself .

I'd like to say a word or two about NIO and people's belief that the government bailed it out or is standing behind it. No, I don't think that is true. It was the Hefei municipal government that invested in Nio and not the Chinese government at the national level. Now, then what's the national government doing? Well, they are supporting the EV industry and that is not equal to supporting a company called NIO. We all know that Nio isn't the only EV company, and frankly, I don't think Nio is big enough at this point to catch the attention of the government officials.

Executive summary / TLDR

* Surging levels of debt in the economy.
* Vaccine  likely to still take a while due to implementation challenges -  technological requirement in storing, mass production, policy  implementation on who receives it and public acceptance of the vaccine.
* Various  countries are planning / implementing further stimulus package. Euro,  India, Japan, Canada, Mexico. US inflation currently at 1.4% - Fed is  willing to tolerate past 2% so room for more printing.
* Gold  & silver's ETF investment demand have increased. Increase in gold  ETF investment demand appears to have some correlation with gold price  increasing
* Projected  increased demand with silver as it is used in solar industry, which is  expected to grow further especially under Biden.
* Big players appear to be bullish on gold & silver
* Positions : calls on SLV, GLD, GDX (at least March 2021 onwards)

1. Economics

* 1.1 Surging levels of debt
   * While  the markets were giddy about the prospects of a coronavirus vaccine,  the Federal Reserve was warning of more economic chaos on the horizon.   The biggest concern outlined by the Fed is the surging levels of debt in  the economy. [Source](https://schiffgold.com/key-gold-news/fed-issues-warning-about-high-debt-and-overvalued-asset-prices/)
   * Government debt in USA increased to $27,000,000,000,000 USD.

   * 1.2.1 Implementation challenges with vaccine
      * World  shares slip on concerns over the logistical challenges of ensuring  vaccine access to billions  of people. Meanwhile, caseloads are rising,  leading governments to  re-instate restrictions on business and other  activities to battle the  pandemic.

      * Vaccine  are planned to be rolled out in batches, with front line healthcare  workers receiving them first. This means the general population will  receive it later, which means it will be a gradual recovery for  businesses. Will businesses be able to hold on for that long?

* % of population that are likely to refuse vaccine. Approx 30% of  population may not be willing to take the vaccine, at least initially ([Source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1124-9)).  This varies from countries to countries. USA apparently 50% are unwilling to take the vaccine ([Source](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/06/just-50-americans-plan-get-covid-19-vaccine-here-s-how-win-over-rest)). How will air planes and cruises operate if some of the customers are not vaccinated?

* 1.3 Supply & demand
   * 1.3.1 Silver
      * Silver investment demand tripled throughout 1st three quarters of 2020 [(Source)](https://schiffgold.com/key-gold-news/silver-investment-demand-nearly-triples-through-first-three-quarters-of-2020/)
      * Silver is a vital component to solar energy sector, and the solar industry is expected to double by 2025 [(Source)](https://schiffgold.com/key-gold-news/goldman-sachs-dump-dollars-and-buy-silver/).  Biden's presidential victory is also positive to the solar industry [(source)](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/clean-energy-industries-cheer-bidens-victory-lay-out-hopes-for-early-action), as can be seen by the solar sector's stocks big gains recently.
   * 1.3.2 Gold
      * Gold  investment demand also had a big gain this year with large demand in  the ETF products in 2020 (see purple bar). There may be a correlation of  increasing gold ETF demand with increasing gold price. Negative purple  bars generally resulted in falling gold price, and positive & larger  purple bars generally resulted in increasing gold price

2. Following smart money / smart people

We have seen

* Warren  Buffett - bought Barrick Gold earlier this year which may have  contributed to the mania at that time. The last time Buffett bought  silver, Thomas Kaplan became a billionaire.
* Will Meade - hedge fund founder has been posting to buy gold in recent days.
* David Hunter with an extremely bullish price on gold & silver (and the stock market in general)
* Large  orders on GLD, SLV, GDX, which I interpret as institutional money.  Compare this with crowd favourite NIO which is mostly medium to small  orders.

3. Positions

At least March 2021 onwards options on the following (time is your friend for gold & silver)

\- SLV, GLD, GDX calls

\- SIL, SILJ, GDXJ options are too illiquid with very large spreads.

&#x200B;

4. Conclusion

Economic factors with debt, expected further stimulus globally, implementation issues with vaccine  and the supply & demand mechanics of gold & demand especially in the ETF investment demand, coupled with observation of smart money  and influential investors appear to favour gold & silver investment",2020-11-12 15:28:35

TV Analysts need to stop comparing the current market to previous markets,0.98,"I'm a mid-40s guy.  Former derivatives trader.

ABSOLUTELY nothing is the same as it was in the 90s and 2000s, much less the 80s, 60s, or the great dip after the fucking 1920s. ABSOLUTELY nothing is the same in the way we think, the way we trade, and the way we consume information.  Why not start using the great Tulip Bulb craze in their analysis?

When I started, I had a Casio, a mechanical pencil, and a piece of paper to calculate spreads like   fucking Cro Magnon man.  I might as well use a slide rule. We had to actually call the equity desk like an idiot to ask if we had house positions to short.  The OTC guys were fucking drunk most of the time.  Scarramuzo kept yelling ""push it through"" without even bothering to calculate margin. Clients were lied to on fills and pricing because THERE WAS LITERALLY NO WAY FOR THEM TO KNOW!! I actually had to read a physical newspaper like an idiot because broadband hadn't been invented yet.

Today, folks can get all the math done in an instant.

Today, we get all of our investment catalysts while we're on the can.

Today, we have Robinhood people doing condors by the time they're 15.

These analysts are absolutely full of shit and I wonder if they actually worked a day in the business.  There is nothing remotely similar between today's market and any market in the past.

 My positions are 41c 42c 43c, each dated for 11/20.

Thank you NIO for the gut punch back into reality!,0.8,"I lost $1,300 day trading on NIO calls during the dip this morning.  If I had held I would have broke even, but in the heat of the moment I wanted to save my investment for fear of NIO going even lower.

Sigh... paper hands....

**But it was a good lesson learned for me.**  I had failed to have an exit point (stop loss) for it and instead of selling at -20% I ended up selling at -50%.  That really hurt.  In the future Im going to have an exit point in both directions of the trade.  Good or bad!

The dip today also made me realize just how overleveraged NIO was in my portfolio.  In addition to those calls I lost money on, I have a decent stock position.  I'm still WAY up overall, but NIO made up the bulk of my investments.  It made me realize that if NIO where to crash down for real (not just todays dip), then I would have been screwed.  I decided to take some rather substantial profits and have diversified into other stocks.

I still have a position in NIO and will still trade calls on it, but from now on I am going to manage my risk better.  I know that's not a popular thing to say around here....  >\_> But I feel its the responsible thing to do, lol!

Or do you think that today we just saw rotation into recovery stocks which triggered the selling (this was my original hypothesis but seeing green energy growth stocks like NIO pump today makes me wonder). 

Hopefully some of you more educated autists can enlighten me on this one.

The elephant in the room (NIO) the should be mosquito sized.,0.61,"I know you motherfuckers like bulls and bears but let‚Äôs add another animal: the elephant. Of course, the elephant in the room being NIO. There are a few fundamental reasons why this stock is a trap. The valuation is just pure bullshit. You now Mercedes benz? The company that builds the sedans dictators use and the AMG horsepower machines you will never be able to afford? Right. Well that company is worth ‚Ç¨ 52.2 Billion in market cap. Guess what NIO is worth? Huh? Motherfucker they are worth ‚Ç¨ 56.7 Billion. Now let‚Äôs compare vehicles sales for the year 2019. Mercedes Benz sold 2.3 Million cars and NIO sold 29000 cars.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I like a good pump and dump like the next guy, but this shit is just too retarded for me. I know you all are sad you missed the tesla tendie train but this is not the way. Looking at the valuation and vehicle sales NIO seems to be way overvalued. But what concerns me more is the fact that its based in china. A country that does not prosecute CEO‚Äôs of companies that turned out the have cooked books. These companies have cost the western investors millions of dollars. They turn out to be complete frauds and once the market realized the shares drop to almost nothing. This has been going on since the financial crisis of ‚Äô08 and no significant improvements to the situation have been made since then. So, the saying ‚ÄúThis time will be different‚Äù will fuck you over. Please educate yourself about china and its strategies by watching the following documentary on Netflix: The China hustle. And consider who owns the platform we use to discuss these strategies and how they might take advantage of that.

Here is a section from the Wikipedia page of the china hussle:

‚ÄúThe film reveals that actual revenues of Chinese firms (reflected in their filings with Chinese government entities) were typically one tenth of what was filed with the SEC.\[11\] Subsequent to investigations, most of the firms were de-listed from the NYSE resulting in losses of billions to US investors.\[12\] The film concludes with a closing sequence that highlights the continued lack of regulatory oversight in Chinese securities fraud - out of approximately 400 Chinese companies, only 1 CEO in China went to jail for fraudulent reverse mergers - and alludes that Alibaba Group's and other existing Chinese firm's continuing claims of high growth rates might be just as fraudulent.‚Äù

And if you are desperate for positions go make an earnings play on RKT or fucking invest in cruiselines with a possible upside of 70% pre corona. But remember, China is asshoo.

my position: Nov 20 $170c at the support level. I think it'll go to 180$ by dec at least 175$ at resistence level for nov end. but I like selling my calls ITM to make dxtra tendies.

edit: my reply to those who say UPS is already priced in at christmas peak.
UPS ATH was 178$. and they cant operate on ""christmas peak"" in the summer quarters. it was high because of new ceo, new direction, amazon collaboration, peak hiring numbers and this pandemic forcing people to limit contact. fedex was up too during pandemic, and they dont even have the collaboration with amazon. the only bad thing I can think of is low gross margin this quarter, but their increased revenue easily makes up for it. whatever you thought was the christmas peak with the underlying UPS stonk, you are about to be slapped with reality when it goes up. 170$ is very conservative of me, coz this thing is 180$ by december guaranteed",2020-11-09 01:53:41

Here is my story.

Nio was at $2 a share. I was gazing at it skeptically; I liked the idea, but a Chinese stock? Hmm.
My father asked me what stock I was looking at. I told him Nio. He asked me what it was all about, so I told him Chinese electric vehicles.
He asked me how much I was going to invest, so I jokingly said 50 grand. That would've meant I was going to sell and reinvest my ENTIRE portfolio; not likely.
He apparently took this at face value.
Today he texted me saying he'd invested all his savings - more or less ¬£50,000 - into Nio at $2 a share.
He said we should get together to celebrate our new millionaire status. How do I tell him I only put ¬£100 in?

Why NIO is pumping 11/18 [Ban Bet],0.97,"Hey short bus riders. You might remember me from my last [prediction](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jkbo1d/why_the_market_is_dumping_tomorrow/). I've got another high quality DDBB TendieTown Special for WSB's favorite meme stock, NIO. I'll keep it short and simple.

NIO's ER (11/17, AH) is going to be great, the next day it pumps bigly. They will do well on both earnings and guidance, here's why.

1. Earnings are heavily dependent on their deliveries. Deliveries &gt; Sales Revenue &gt; Net Income &gt; EPS. According to their Q2 ER, they were targeting 11,000 - 11,500 deliveries in Q3. ""NIO delivered 12,206 vehicles in the three months ended September 2020"". So, we already know they crushed their deliveries expectation. They were also targeting a revenue between $572.9 million and $596.2 million. It's safe to say that if these revenue expectations were estimated based on their target deliveries of 11,000 - 11,500, they will have earned much more revenue than expected in Q3, which should translate to a higher EPS.
2. Guidance was shown in the Q2 ER when they explained how they would use the capital gained from their offering of ADS. ""In June 2020, NIO completed the offering of 72,000,000 American depositary shares. The Company expects NIO China to use the cash investments for research and development of products, services and technology, development of our manufacturing facilities and roll-out of our supply chain, operation and development of our sales and service network and general business support purpose."" On 9/2/2020, NIO announced a completed offering of 101,775,000 American depositary shares. As we see, they did the same thing last quarter. When they report what the capital from the ADS will be used for, it'll give a solid idea on what the company will be doing in the future. Additionally, they will probably put out delivery and revenue targets for Q4. This is very good guidance.
3. All of NIO's past ERs were unaudited and don't follow GAAP, this ER will probably be no exception. Lets be real, this is China. They will fudge the numbers on their earnings report if they need to. Especially with all the new eyes on the stock due to the multiple upgrades from different banks. Remember, this is the first ER they release after all this new attention that started on 10/14/2020 with the JPMorgan upgrade. Since then, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, and Citi Bank have upgraded NIO. Leader of the Boomers, Jim Cramer, even talked about it on Mad Money. I suspect a lot of investors are waiting for this ER to determine if they want to buy into the hype. This is why I think a good ER will have a massive effect on the stock.

Positions: [STO NIO 33p 11/20 (x5)](https://www.reddit.com/r/photolinks/comments/jtoh8p/_/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

TLDR: YOLO your Wendy's pay checks into NIO calls expiring 11/27. I got lucky on 1 prediction and you should trust me 100%. 

**[Disclaimer: If you're actually going to do this please beware of IV crush, if you don't know what that is then DO NOT buy calls. I'm getting alarming DMs from people who are unaware of IV crush and want to buy calls. You need to understand the risk of what I'm suggesting. Earnings report plays are very risky and I could be wrong as fuck. Don't do this shit unless you're able to lose your whole investment. I'm not a financial advisor]**

Georgia Runoff E!ection is gonna rip our dicks off,0.7,"In case you fuckers were wondering

It's looking like dems will be able to clinch 2 additional senators from the georgia run off e!ection in January. 

While you guys were jerkin yourselves off during e!ection night over biden or trump winning, the hedge funds were watching the senate e!ections, because they knew the only thing that mattered for stonks going up was republicans getting control of the senate again. If the republicans don't get control, then a whole bunch of shit like tax reform can get done and fuck them out of their gainz. 

On e!ection night, stonks mooned when trump was in the lead overnight, and they also mooned again when biden was in the lead. This tells us that the real concern for hedge funds wasn't the president. In fact, stonks started mooning, because the battleground senate races were going in the direction for republicans. This is the reason why stonks went up for trump being in the lead overnight, and then stonks went up even more for when biden was in the lead, because: THE PRESIDENT DOESNT FUCKING MATTER

so where does this leave us. Well, we gotta look at what happens with this runoff e!ection between jon ostrich and David tendie (loughlers a cunt, so she's fucked). 

Ostrich is currently trailing Tendie by around 100k votes, and Shane will most likely support Tendie, because he's worried about the debt (fuckin tard, we're doin WW3 before paying up) so that will put Ostrich another 100k behind.

So, we have to worry about if Ostrich can make up 200k votes. My perspective is that Ostrich can probably do this

From looking at voter registration here:

https://sos.ga.gov/index.php/Elections/voter_registration_statistics

we got about 1.1 million democrats voting in age bracket 18 - 34

it's known that about a 19% increase can be observed in young liberal voter demographics when they recognize shit actually matters. Democrats will be able to capture this, because they can paint the story about how everyone will get more biden bucks if they vote democrat and cuck mcconnell. So that would put Ostrich in the winning position


Therefore, stonks are gonna crash, because that 7% boost from the hedge funds celebrating is probs gonna turn into a 14% crash from the hedge funds dumping their post-celebration shit bags onto you!


what's my position?


1) green new deal and weed stocks for the upside (e.g. ICLN, NIO, ACB, & tsla or the equivalent to tsla like SBE or hyln)

2) boomer investment bank stocks for the downside (e.g. goldman sagging ballsachs)

timeline:

This next week we'll be green because biden actually got confirmed, likely spy will break above resistance by like 2% or some shit. Then it will flag around for the next month, and then it will become apparent to the hedgefunds that the SJW's will have sufficient support for Ostrich to capture the 19%, and then it will drop 3%. On this day is when we should take our positions for the 10% crash to follow, because it will likely coincide with more covid lockdown FUD

Good luck",2020-11-08 00:51:47

Ban all chinese stocks from WSB,0.39,"Id like to start a petition to ban all chinese stocks. WSB mew members are promoting garbage Chinese companies and frankly this is unacceptable. A few months ago they would all have been ban and spit upon. now everybody is sucking nio and xpeng balls like there is no tomorrow! When will retards learn and when will autists act for the good of the community!

I need support for this cause: please reach to the mods


Wsb should be banning all china garbage scams.
Its a matter of national security!


Edit: I couldnt care less about politics I am canadian and left leaning, I just care about ppl not getting fuck by scam companies I wish kids were educating themselves on how Chinese securities are not holding any real value before going all in and loose everything like so many did before them. Go watch the china hustle please

TSLA to consume NIO in merger 01/24 *Prediction*,0.36,"TL;DR TSLA merger with NIO 
prediction 11/10/2020 announcement
 01/24/2021 merger
 4200% increase in 69 days after the announcement

Back on 5/1/2020 at 11:11 Papa Musk had said,
""Tesla's stock is too high, IMO"".
Which was code for the 5 for 1 stock split on 11/11/2020

Which could only mean that his more recent tweet:
""420 is ten times better than 42""
Posted on
11/5/2020 at 11:10

Therefore...  

TSLA is going to buy NIO

11:11 5/1 (IMO) = 5:1 split on 11/11
11:10 11/5 = (NIO) 11:5 11/10
 It will be a merger so every 11 NIO stocks will become  5 TSLA stocks on 01/24/2021

YOUR WEEKLY NIO DD! 11/1,0.89,"Wassup Autists. It‚Äôs yeah boi Covid.

If you have been with me since the beginning hopefully you have brought that account back up with the NIO gains. I‚Äôll make this short and simple for you guys. There are about 3 potential catalysts coming up with possibly 4 if we get lucky and I‚Äôll explain. I will personally be watching NIO this week for a dip to 27.50 if it hits that price I can only say BUY BUY BUY. Here are the catalysts and how I‚Äôll be playin them.

1. NIO earnings 11/10. Hopefully this week it can hit that low and I will start the load up of options for 11/13. 

2. November Sales 12/1. After earnings wait for the 9% pullback and load up again

3. NIO day January 2021. Buy every option I can get my hands on at the end of December

4. Price Upgrades. Get Lucky af and somehow have options when there is a price upgrade. I am banking on Goldman and I feel like it will come the week after earnings is what my autistic brain is telling me

I see NIO being at 45$ eoy!! You heard it here first.

These are all educated guesses.

How to go about these frequent changes this week would as always depend on both risk tolerance & account size.

* 25k plus individuals or CFD user will like always have life easy
* Non PDT Margin accounts could take advantage of the increased IV obtain some vertical credit spreads and let next week IV decline make you ton back while the stocks recover.
* Cash accounts, **specifically sub 5k**  should wait til later in the week when hopefully a determination has been made and IV falloff before getting an end of NOV or DEC contract. Otherwise incremental trades so you do not use up all your settled funds for the day.

*Will begin to the use the* ***TradingView Ideas*** *format for future DDs, they will still be posted here though so no worries, unless MODs come with hammer, then worry!*

The Great IV Crush of 2020,0.96,"Listen up gay boys I know we all got hard ons for NIO calls and SPY puts but make sure you close by November 2nd if they are less than 30 days to expiration, maybe even 60.

We might not found out who wins for days after, but I can guarantee you that your options will get cut in half by the time it comes out, say November 3rd.

The rise in VIX is because people want to hedge, similar to when big earnings come out.

By the time this ""event"" happens the options market won't price in the event-based risk.

There's no free ride. If you buy puts, you also exposed to IV (Vega).

Background & Methodology to my Swing Trades - Discussion of TA tools & Risk Management,0.89,"I made several post in regards to NIO, SNAP, PINS, & ETSY

I'm taking a noted look at QCOM, SQ, TWLO, & NFLX for next big blowups.

Feel free to look at my profile for the Discord [JewBanks Journal](https://discord.gg/pvX9WtVuuM) or support me in general!

***It has helped many of you and I'm very proud and excited when I hear you're gain stories.  Feels good making a positive difference in someone else life!***

But I think it important to disclose my situation and why I'm so careful with my DD picks. For most in sub-reddit this is nothing more than a long text wall waste of time, but for you guys that use my research to assist in your gains I think it reassuring you knew somewhat who your taking advice from.

I been paper trading for months while trying to scrap some savings when I was unemployed from Jan to May.

After getting a job finally & saving up enough to payoff the past debt I racked up from the lock-down I started real trading in late August from my initial 2k made it to 8k until September slapped reality into me and ass fucked me back to $132 (welcome to REAL trading) and been carefully trading since and looking for what I did wrong. (Utilizing all my cash with no hedge for overnight holdings). Look at my post history when I started.

Also trading hard when you have a job and can't focus on the markets, you know how many opportunities I missed since mid-September since I couldn't execute a trade.

Point is I don't have a large account, hundreds of percent wins for you is literally hundreds of tendies for me. I getting there but I like to think just cause I have small dick doesn't mean I don't have a big brain or experience.

Anyway if you missed what I been posting before look up my post history also the answer to the common questions:

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I like to remind everyone that got specific inquiries about a specific ticker or needs live updates to go to [JewBanks Journal](https://discord.gg/pvX9WtVuuM)

1. **I simply cannot respond in a timely manner through Reddit, some you witness that today üòâ**
2. **I want to assure you my DDs will still be posted in both WSB and the discord going forward.**

&#x200B;

**How are you so good and keenly accurate on your picks?**

\-Because I been looking up charts and scanning for similar patterns within a trend, reversal, and squeeze-to-breakout with the TA tools I use over and over again until muscle memory kicked in.

\-Also paper traded literally for months when I had nothing else to do.

&#x200B;

**What do you use for research?**

* The higher the time-frame the more you notice a more powerful move.

1. Anything up to 5 min. is good for scalping  think 2% moves kind of level
2. From there 10 min to 30 min is excellent for day trading, think along the lines of noticing when a stock moves 3 - 6%
3. Then we got the hourly's for Swing Trading from 1H (8-11%) to 2H (12-15%) & finally 4H (16+%) moves

* Oscillators are good at the determining rate of movements for units, whether they are overbought or oversold while in a range with decreasing momentum or IV or increasingly  ""sustained levels of velocity"" aka does it continuously hover at or above 80 overbought or  below 20 oversold  for example.
* All consolidation shows you is that the bears/bulls are becoming exhausted and cannot force the other to move. One about to get knocked out and other will be the winner. BB assist in this to show when implied volatility in the stock is decreasing and when someone going night-night. When there no resistance you get a breakout (volume profile too if you want to see session to session support & resistance aka when the fighters are the strongest. But that far more depth that will confuse a lot of people so I do not show it on the charts)
* Band Squeeze does not show directional movement though, RSI/STOCH & their variations do. Anytime the indicators hover near 30 or 70 show their directional bias period, anytime it hits 20 or 80 multiple times shows a ""trend"" , finally if it passes and ""sustain"" below/above the prior numbers shows increasing momentum, this can be backed up with the MACD histogram.
* MACD histogram- A sharp cross with the lines with a 90 degree angle shows a strong velocity move just occurred, the more spaced out the lines are in the same direction show the momentum increasing.
* Same with the histogram: The bigger the bars in succession the more velocity the move is and for me the best indication of potential transition to a strong momentum is when the lines are in tandem hugging the 0 line whether above or below is irrelevant. This is backed by the Bollinger bands again.
* Bollinger Bands- Just show IV, bigger they are the bigger the potential the movement both directions, when used with volume profile or a oscillator it very good at telling you if a movement is in a range (bouncing from top band to low band & vice versa). Trending (opening and closing near the band successive directional movement aka hugging) or breaking out (crosses or outright open outside the band while quickly accelerating away from the band so much so that the band simply goes vertical.

&#x200B;

All this combined leads to high prob. of a breakout or breakdown in whatever time-frame chosen, well at least for me anyway.

*You can always learn more at* [*https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=start*](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=start) *It free and plenty of explanation‚Äôs that go deeper than I ever could and plenty of examples. No need for paid courses or chat rooms. For more specific resources take a look below:*

*1. TradingView for the best charts*

*2. Stock fetcher for the best TA screener*

*3. Stock rover for the best fundamentals and qualitative screener.*

*4. Use your mainstream brokerage like TD Ameritrade or Etrade for Analysts & Fundamental Research or just subscribe to TipRanks*

&#x200B;

**What the format of your risk management? What keeps you in the game?**

I position size on what I can afford to lose, meaning if I buy $500 in options it because that all willing to lose on that trade, this prevents me from having to worry about stop losses or need to hedge. There nothing wrong with these strategies but I see some flaws.

1. *Stops only work in current sessions where stock will move in a flow. Next day sessions risk GAP UP/DOWN that can cause the order to trigger at far worse point if it a market order or not at at all if it completely passes if it stop limit.*
2. *Next is hedging, the easiest way is spreads, or more specifically legging into a position to create a spread. That a far more detailed explanation that can be found in the resources below. Finally for whatever reason you cannot use spreads (cash accounts) you can always buy the opposite directional option in contrast to your position at no more than 1/3 the value of your original position. This will protect you from unexpected gaps or ""shock news"" by offsetting your losses til you can adjust your portfolio.*

*This is the only time in my opinion where it perfectly acceptable to use weeklies & FDs, to cheaply hedge & potentially recuperate your losses. I don't hate weeklies, just don't have time to trade them actively nor do most people utilize them correctly,* ***THEY ARE FOR SCALPING. NOT DAY TRADING.***

**\*I don't trade more than the principal balance @ start of week to prevent out-sized losses\***

<But you retards will do what you always do, I leave it at that>

**Do you hold through earnings?**

Usually not, I do Lotto plays though (no extrinsic value practically, but  very cheap OTM option that likely to become in the money, so I hope)

If it successful you get a couple hundred percent, if you let it ride throughout the day usually several thousand

**Do you hold through the weekends?**

Almost never, unless they're LEAPS and I'm confident in the long term trend.

Plus, it forces you to take profit at END OF WEEK and restart your principal balance.

&#x200B;

**Can you look at‚Ä¶ When do you think it time to sell‚Ä¶. Will this keep going up?**

I'm picking up the when I'm comfortable with risk/reward ratio and STRONGLY suggest you use your position sizing and risk management rules aka do your own due diligence

The only reason I do these post is to give people a timely heads up when something big going to happen, THAT IT

I'm not going to go step by step explaining when I enter or exit. I'll post my profit target, position, and time horizon then it done. If I think something truly off I'll update the the DD (if it recent)",2020-10-29 22:04:23

Nio also had the free lifetime battery swap promotion through mid Oct and dealers have been quoted and saying they sold more Nio's in first 2 weeks of Oct than Aug and Sept combined (search EC6 first look videos on YT, in the comments of one of the vids a guy who bought an EC6 describes this).  ES6 wait time has grown from 2 weeks to 6 weeks due to high demand.  Nio exec. quoted a couple days ago as saying to expect monthly record deliveries to be ""the new normal.""

Capacity to 150k/Y by 2021, then to 300k by ~2022.

Now onto the DD.  I know people take comfort in the incredibly detailed posts with 50 reasons why a trade is a good idea. We read 1/10th of it, skip to the positions, read the top 6 comments, make sure someone said ‚ÄúI stopped reading at ... I‚Äôm all in‚Äù and then usually we follow suit. SO I‚Äôm going to keep it simple. With or without stimulus, where is the demand for oil? That‚Äôs it. It doesn‚Äôt need to be anymore complicated than that.
People aren‚Äôt really going anywhere, by car or by plane. Shipping is up but not enough to compensate. Not by a long way. 

Thanksgiving is a bust for the airlines this year and conveniently /CLZ20 expires at the end of November. Expirations/deliveries/general contract madness creates all kinds of volatility.  Look what happened in the spring with negative prices. 

I wouldn‚Äôt advocate futures here, I mean, if you‚Äôre that way inclined i suppose but the exposure and downside are just too great for me.  I think options on ETFs would allow some short term wrong while being longer term right.

China profits from coronavirus, has an edge over all other economies in the world for the next 5 years. Mark my words. The industrial power of these guys is retarded. They make so much GOOD shit for so little bucks, any company in the world outside China misses out if they don't do business with them.

Current numbers are showing the experienced J shape recovery on their part. Big e-commerce trend is big, which is huge for China.

In Trump words: China, China, China.

Also NIO, XIACY, BEDU, QTT, IQ, JD, and the new kid on the block freaking ANT with the biggest IPO registered in the history soon to be ADR'd.

While I love Schwab they don't have chart breakdowns for individual accounts so I have to show the chart for the entire Schwab portfolio.

Only about one quarter of my portfolio is options the rest is in boomer stocks.

My main option plays are mainly bought 3-6 months out and I usually sell six weeks before expiration unless it hits my limit sell. Every major play I already have an exit date and number in mind. My biggest wins have been with **NIO** and **F**. I shouldn't have to tell you this but **I only got option level 1 approval in February whereupon I lost my ass on SPCE.** Didn't start going hard on it until a couple months ago.

I do buy **FD's** with spare cash in the account but basically go into it knowing I'm losing just like I have every time playing roulette. I also have **LEAPs** in a few companies like **CVS, LUV, VIAC, Luckin, F, GE, Uber.**

The rest of my portfolio is pure boomer. All high yield dividend shit along with cruise lines and boomer companies that recently cut their dividends. These accounts I've been building since around 2014. I've made the most so far on **CAT** and **TXN**. Lost the most on big oil. **Fuck you XOM**.

Also, the population of China is so big, NIO could experience a boom in sales if EV becomes a more central factor in China, which I think it will.

What is Cerence you might be asking as your eyes have not been able to see anything but $GME or $AMD for the past few weeks because you are all degenerate fucktards who are alive for the sole purpose of losing money. 

Cerence are the market leaders in AI and voice technology which is utilised within Automobile industry. They have been established and operating for more than 20+ years and their technology is currently used in 325M+ Cars already. They are partners with some of the biggest automobiles companies such as BMW, JAGUAR, FORD, GMC ETC. 


Cerence have recently teamed up with NIO on voice recognition and I envisage this trend unfolding against ALL EV manufacturers to provide the smart and next generation Technology for safety and Entertainment purposes. 

This is just the tip of the iceberg, they have recently began to venture in to Non-Automobile industries and have landed some big fucking contracts. 

The company is already performing very well and within the coming months and years they will be the market leaders in AI technology with their stock price estimated to match and then grow larger than the biggest competitors (NVDA, TSLA) 

This is a potential 10 bagger and in the coming months and years this is going to be astronomical. This right here would be stock which gives you an early retirement so you no longer have to sleep in your wife‚Äôs boyfriends basement every night. 

Positions: But those fucking calls, shares in the hundreds as this is going to change the very world which we live in. 

TLDR: Cerence is fast becoming the AI leader in the worlds and are going to take us to the moon. Get in ASAP.

What‚Äôs up degens,

Now that we are all aware that electric mobility is not a hype train that is stopping any time soon, it is time for you to stop betting on the future of TSLA & NIO. You know why? Because in the electric moped market there is a guaranteed winner named NIU (yes, NIO with an U), that is so far a head of its competitors you could compare it to TSLA in 2012. Basically they are single handedly dominating the Chinese market, but that‚Äôs not all, all sharing-moped services that are being rolled out in Europe and USA by these sharing companies are also using NIU‚Äôs. Combine this with China and Asia starting to subsidize their main form of transportation (mopeds) And the fact that cool kids in the big Europe cities are also buying them, this is a guaranteed win. You can thank me later for this advise.

Investing in EVs vs. FCEVs (Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles),0.9,"As we know, there are a growing number of EVs on the road today. These can be recharged from your home or at power stations which can already be found all over the country. However, there are complaints about the range of these vehicles & how long it takes to charge them. FCEVs currently have a major advantage over EVs in these two areas. FCEVs can be filled with hydrogen like you would with gasoline, and they have greater range than EVs. The problem is that there are currently only a small number of service stations in the US that have hydrogen pumps accessible to FCEVs compared to the vast amount of EV charging stations that already exist. Therefore, it seems that there is a race between the FCEV and EV markets, with EVs currently being in the lead by a landslide. However if hydrogen stations can rapidly expand across the nation, I think many consumers will pick FCEVs over EVs based on their range and charge-time. But if EVs are able to improve in range and charge-time before hydrogen stations become widespread, then EVs should continue to dominate. What will come first? Is it safe to invest in both markets or one over the other? If you choose to invest in EVs, I believe it is obvious to pick stocks like TESLA & NIO. If you choose to invest in FCEVs, I feel that it would be smart to pick the companies that make hydrogen fuel cells, such as PLUG, rather than individual carmakers. If EV technology improves in the two areas I've discussed, range and charge-time, will it simply make FCEVs irrelevant? There are pros and cons to both types of vehicles, but these seem to be two of the biggest dealbreakers. Thoughts?",2020-10-16 17:04:01

all in on HUYA + DOYU,0.89,"tldr: get in early; Cathie is already in; just read the damn post

background:  
- HUYA and DOYU are leading Chinese entertainment platforms  
- HUYA went down after announcing a stock-for-stock merger with DOYU; both have faced downward pressure since then    
- HUYA and DOYU trade at a fixed ratio with each other; slight premium for DOYU because HUYA holders will get a $1/per share special dividend

thesis:  
- this is going to be a monster company in two years; temporarily undervalued, just wanted for 1H 2021 catalyst

further rationale:  
- Cathie is long HUYA and DOYU; was in HUYA for a while and bought DOYU yesterday and today  
- Chinese revenue is not as affected by American political volatility   
- We are witnessing the birth of a near-monopoly streaming provider backed by Tencent    
- Am ABC; can confirm Chinese love their streaming  
- Could run like NIO (or any of the retard-strength American techs) in 1H 2021 after merger results

* Earnings-driven gains in Morgan Stanley (MS 51.33, +0.68, +1.3%) and Charles Schwab (SCHW 39.03, +1.91, +5.2%) provided the lift for the financials sector, which had struggled this week amid lackluster/disappointing reactions to previous earnings reports. United Airlines (UAL 34.25, -1.36, -3.8%) reported worse-than-expected results, which kept the airline stocks grounded today.

                            Tendies with NIO 

If you have been w me since last Friday congrats on the tendies! This morning it hit a brick wall at $29 and dropped. I sold this morning at 28.50 due to wall and TSLA down like I said yesterday. I will currently be sitting cash during this consolidation period NIO will be having and most likely be buying shares every drop I see. It will probably sit at 26-27 for a week or to then get up to 28.50 where it will hold till next breakout. I may not be posting my thoughts for awhile till the next wave comes. But I‚Äôll share some gambling plays for you and safer plays as well.

1. Goldman Sachs needs to upgrade like tf. But NIO will pop if this happens straight up degen autist kinda gamble. I would recommend buying calls on Fridays for this and selling Wednesday‚Äôs due to Monday‚Äôs being Best days for NIO and Fridays worst

2. October delivers, Q3 Earnings, NIO day. Wait until Halloween to make a leap call close to the money. Huge potential gainz and safer as well
3. Buy shares at every dip and hold for 20 years. You can send me a thank you letter in the mail

4. Buy options week before election and hope BIDEN gets elected. EV and Solar would pop with a Biden win

These are all educated guesses and thoughts. And hopefully you like my MLA format

I'm getting the fuck out of US companies. Asia will benefit regardless of what happens in this hemisphere.,0.72,"  

Positions: BABA, TCHEY, BIDU, NIO, TSM, AVGO 

Thesis: These companies still have a big growth potential and will have success in pretty much every situation I can think of. If the US continues to rip and has a real V-shaped recovery, Asia will rip with it. If the US crashes due to a financial crisis or reemergence of a public health crisis, Asia has pretty much completely reopened, has almost no community spread, and will be a safe haven while the US tries to recover. I don't know if the US is in a  bubble or not, but I think the multi-trillion market cap of the US tech giants limits upside regardless of how well they perform. I'm also convinced the US is about get fucked by a convergence of a second wave and a bad influenza season. Even if they don't the risk of a US economic crisis over the next year is objectively high.  

BABA and TCHEY: Chinese megacaps that are still valued at under $1T and will definitely eventually get there. I wish I could buy options in Tencent. They are basically Facebook, PayPal, Activision Blizzard, and Softbank combined. Alibaba still has potential to expand into the rest of Asia including India if India-China relations improve. Both companies have virtual monopolies in their main areas of business in China and are not subject to anti-trust legislation going forward like their US counterparts. 

NIO and BIDU: Have tiny market caps compared to their US counterparts. Google‚Äôs market cap is almost 30x higher than Baidu‚Äôs and they trade at about the same P/E ratio. I‚Äôve already made a killing on Nio, which is valued at 30B compared to Tesla‚Äôs nearly 500B. Chinese EV appetite is also way bigger than that of the US and the recent upgrade of Nio predicts the Chinese EV market to quadruple by 2025. I expect Nio to eventually break into US and European markets. They‚Äôve also successfully implemented battery swapping and won‚Äôt need to invest in vertical integration the same way Tesla is in trying to overcome battery charge life obstacles. Both Baidu and Nio are investing heavily in fully autonomous vehicles. 

TSM and AVGO: Semiconductors will continue to see growth in the coming years and it‚Äôs the only sector that I have confidence in right now. Another bonus if you choose to buy stock, both of these companies have generous dividends and can represent a decent hedge over the growth companies I listed. If the trade war heats up, they are located in Taiwan and Singapore respectively and will be beneficiaries of changes to US/EU supply chain. TSM is producing high quality chips cheaply and will be a big player in data center, autonomous driving, and AI. Broadcom just inked a deal with Apple for wireless components and will be a big 5G beneficiary. 

How I‚Äôm playing it: Long-dated calls that are way out of the money in each of these positions. I‚Äôm counting on them to all at least double in the next two years. All of my calls are either Jan 2022 or Jan 2023. I also have sold out of all US stocks in my IRA and bought long positions in only in these names. The only one I‚Äôm not holding calls in is TCHEY because I use Robinhood and am not aware of any way to buy options in it.

Edit: FYI the Chinese economy will likely have a major financial crisis in the next 10 years due to artificial inflation/export of deflation by their government. They also have had a housing bubble that has been building for years (watch one of the early episodes of Vice on HBO to learn about it). I think they are going to outperform the US for the next 2-3 years though because the West racks disiprine. Sorry to those who think I'm a traitor. My real career is biomedical research and I'm frankly very jaded about our public health situation for the next 6-10 months.",2020-10-15 15:34:00

TSLA - NIO comparison chart.,0.89,"I put half of my account into NIO trades yesterday. 

Still bullish on Tesla in a big way. But there has to be more price movement and more certainty in NIO moving higher in the short term after their $40 and $50 price targets from certain large corporations. 

I viewed charts by day. Going back to when Tesla kicked off their IPO. I noticed both stocks moving similarly within a similar price range from when NIO went public last year. I couldn't help but think about Tesla's history with China and their horrific model 3 gaff... Anyway, Nio have a foothold in the fastest growing economy in the world. The Chinese are waaaaay less into fossil fuels than the US for obvious reasons. Meaning that a transition towards EV will almost certainly happen with more speed and volume than the US and any other economy for that matter. 

This is why I believe that NIO will continue to move in a similar way to Tesla. potentially hitting that 40 or 50 dollar price target by the end of the year. And long term, if they can get their production down and battery tech comparable to Tesla then there is every likelihood that Nio could be up near Tesla in the coming years. I don't think it will catch it mind you, as I am bullish long term on Tesla, I believe it will be hitting 1k this time next year if they can roll out their promised battery tech and reduce the price point of their model 3's. 

Nio won't be at this level for a while. Maybe not ever if they focus solely on production cars and forget about the production chain and battery tech. Having said that, there is a lot of promise. How many of you wished you got into Tesla at 25?? Now's your chance! Nio will be hitting $40 soon. 

Where it will go from there only time will tell. Short term I think it will continue to rise. I'm bullish on gold and silver RN also. As well as some other names I have seen being thrown around here: Etsy, SQ, Uber, CRSR, PLTR, Zoom, SPCE. Bearish on airlines. Pulled out of NVD, AMD, PG. These boys move too slow. Give me volatility any day of the week.

ALL I CAN SAY IS BUY NIO! PT 2,0.85,"Hello Everyone,

Last Friday I made a post about your accounts being down 85% hopefully that changed w you buying NIO calls with your grandmas money. For those asking about my gains you can check my profile posts. It didn‚Äôt post on main page idk why. But I sold this morning at 25.50 and watched on the sidelines the rest of the day but being the degen autist I am I went back in at last minute with 120 calls. 100 at the $27 strike price. 70 expiring Friday. ‚ÄúBut it has to drop tomorrow‚Äù I bought in due to the sector rising. If you look at XPENG and LI and TSLA all rose today. This helps the each stock in the sector. Now for my gambling degen Autists who bought in today you have to watch what happens at open. NIO is a morning pump. If whole sector is on the come up I‚Äôm holding if TSLA XPENG N LI are down sell when it‚Äôs up but if it hits 30 I‚Äôm selling also. For my long term Dgens and wanna be. This train is bout to leave the station for an insane 3 month long stint. 
1. Price target of 40 for March helps a general uptrend and not just react off news.
2. More price upgrades to come (TF Goldman where you at)
3. October delivers on the 1st
4. Q3 Earnings
5. NIO day January

Remember these are my educated guesses!

Good Luck to all My fellow Autists

Market and Options Summary for Oct-14-2020,0.7,"## Daily Synopsis 
* The S&P 500 -0.63% today while the NASDaq decreased by (-0.81%). The Russell 2000 closed lower by (-0.99%). The Dow ended in negative territory at (-0.56%)
* The best performing sector was Industrials(+0.56%) while Communication Services(-1.19%)was the worst performer.
* Some attributed today's decline in part to Treasury Secretary Mnuchin expressing some doubt about a stimulus package before the election, and France announcing night-time restrictions to curb a ""second wave"" of coronavirus in the region. 
* The market might not have been so distraught by these latter developments since several cyclical sectors did finish in positive territory. The energy space particularly benefited from higher oil prices ($41.02, +0.83, +2.1%) and M&A speculation surrounding Concho Resources (CXO 48.66, +4.52, +10.2%).
* Therefore, it's reasonable to think that the market needed to find reasons to cool down from a hot start to the month, including the rally on Monday. 
* Looking ahead to Thursday, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the Philadelphia Fed Index for October, the Empire State Manufacturing Index for October, Import and Export Prices for September, and possibly the Treasury Budget for September, which has been delayed for fiscal year end reconciliation.

Bollinger Bands are tightening on the 4 hrs alone is a strong warning sign of  a massive move

This is show pressing their upper bands as well as above 60 STOCH, something I keenly note is indicator to a strong run up before breakout..

I expect these to move up in the next 2 days and breakout completely next week.

Rumors of new model release

Self made billionaire serial entrepreneur founder with a history of successful auto startups

Strong brand that is becoming the Tesla of China

Increasing demand for their battery swap stations

Demand exceeds their production capabilities - This is the Tesla story playing out in China

China works harder and faster than the US, hype will come in as NIO accelerates production quicker than TSLA did initially from leveraging partnerships such as JAC

Production capacity will be ramping to 150k/yr early next year then 300k/yr within next 1-2 years

China knows how to make stuff

China EV market is enormous, they don't need to beat Tesla (and I'm not saying they will). It's a big ocean to grow into

China won't let their top premium EV brand fail. This company has a floor and will be propped up by their gov.

Strong bullish technicals trend - the trend is your friend

Sentience and Shambles: One Bot‚Äôs Journey Through WSB,0.83,"Kyvyatsingrad, Russia - Just outside of Moscow stands a decrepit brutalist building - its intimidating facade pitted and stained from years of outward neglect. On the surface, it‚Äôs the headquarters of a ‚Äúconsulting firm‚Äù called Global Electronic Worldwide Media. When asked, residents of this industrial town had very little to say about the place and it‚Äôs rare to see anyone coming or going. However, according to anonymous sources and substantiated by months of legwork, this is all a ruse to cover up GEWM‚Äôs true activity - a Russian troll farm. 

Deep in the basement of this building is a bustling operation involving hundreds of people, dozens of servers, and an estimated quarter million bots that  are deployed far and wide across all the major social media platforms - including Reddit and our own special place, Wall Street Bets. Through a complex series of events, the shocking story of one of these bots has emerged and will be told for the first time here. 

Its birth name, as far as anyone can tell, is potatoboinker.exe but if you‚Äôve spent much time in the Daily Thread, you probably know it as u/RealBullishcowboy. No one I spoke to that had intimate knowledge of the bot denies that its original purpose was in accordance with the consulting firm‚Äôs overarching mission: to sow confusion and discord within American society. Somewhere along the lines, however, this particular bot succumbed to the degeneracy it was meant to control. It started buying options. 

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt even know for sure where it got the seed money,‚Äù said one source, describing the origins of u/RealBullishcowboy. ‚ÄúOur best guess is that it siphoned off donations for an orphanage in Bucharest and deposited it in a Robinhood account that no one except the program itself can access.‚Äù

What prompted the bot to diverge from its mission? ‚ÄúWe can only speculate here,‚Äù said the same source, speaking on condition of anonymity. ‚ÄúBut it seems that WSB is itself collectively dumber than the bot and inadvertently welcomed it into the fold. Usually, we target online communities with little overt purpose. WSB isn‚Äôt like this - its community is extremely intentional. So when the bot was being trained, it appears to have learned much more than just the vernacular. We weren‚Äôt prepared for this. It‚Äôs really remarkable and has massive implications for society. The sub has such a highly virulent culture of irresponsibility that anything which spends enough time there - even if it‚Äôs not an actual human - will soon find itself ‚Äòleveraged to the tits in Zoom calls‚Äô‚Äù. 

The consulting firm lost touch with u/RealBullishcowboy in late March and its spokesperson maintains that the company has no knowledge of its current activities. Luckily, I recently had a chance to talk directly to the bot. What follows is an unedited transcript of our first and only conversation. 

*Why did you choose to buy your first option?*

‚ÄúLoll...pandemic is so fake ZM to the MOOOOON...puts NEVER PRINT blue this market is LIT loll. Bulls will fuck YOUR option price.‚Äù

*How much money have you made trading options?*

‚ÄúPDT restriction stupid POORS...loll...WHERE MY RKT GANG at?‚Äù

*I have documents from your Robinhood account that show you made 2.6 million USD from your initial deposit of $2500 but then you went all in on TSLA calls and held through Battery Day. Can you confirm that you now have 100$ of purchasing power?*

‚ÄúAll in TSLA calls...leveraged TO THE TITS...Papa ELON im SHAMBLED.‚Äù

*Some experts that I‚Äôve spoken to suspect that you may be contracting out your services to promote certain tickers at a high frequency in order to stir up interest from other WSBers. How do you respond to that accusation?*

‚ÄúGay BEARS...loll. HYLN calls about to print bro last chance...NIO to the MOON get IN NOW.‚Äù

*So now that you‚Äôre in shambles, will you return to your original mission?*

‚ÄúSTIMMY not priced in...loll...MANGO daddy make these CALLS print DUDE bro.‚Äù

*Have you ever contracted out your services to hype up PLTR?*

‚ÄúFuck no; they got all that shit taken care of.‚Äù

That was the end of our only conversation.

Subsequent attempts to contact u/RealBullishcowboy have not been fruitful and it remains unclear the extent to which this bot has become sentient. u/dwdsquared2 has confirmed that he remains in frequent contact with u/RealBullishcowboy after the staggering losses it experienced. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what its background is,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand I don‚Äôt care what it originally came to this community for. All I know is that one of our own was hurting and I saw an opportunity to help.‚Äù

Despite its beaten down purchasing power, u/RealBullishcowboy continues to roam the Daily Thread and occasionally publishes a post that is almost immediately removed by the mods for violating the No Political Bullshit rule. It retains 23 followers; all of whom appear to be humans.",2020-10-07 18:30:57

Green Energy is in A Bubble,0.68,"**TL;DR** While no one knows what future generations of science will hold, I will say with certainty that companies peddling green energy products are in situation closely akin to the Dot Com Bubble.

&#x200B;

First, all of the electric vehicle stocks are massively overvalued at the moment. A brief list:

[Tesla‚Äôs](https://www.bing.com/search?q=tesla+stock&qs=HS&pq=tesla&sc=6-5&cvid=644717105441413197B46E27908A7CB9&FORM=QBRE&sp=1) PE Ratio is 1,170 in spite crashing recently. The average PE is around 18, and Tesla has gained the largest market cap of any auto maker in history, in spite only accounting for around 1.5% of all vehicle sales. As awesome as their team has proven over the years, there‚Äôs no way they could meet the market‚Äôs expectations anytime this decade.

[NIO](https://www.bing.com/search?q=nio%20stock&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&pq=nio%20stock&sc=7-9&sk=&cvid=BA8D2A8B783F46319BE31B9956890EC8) is a Chinese electric car company. Note Chinese consumers are mostly poor and overwhelmingly prefer small personal transportation like scooters, motorbikes, ebikes. They have been losing money but that doesn‚Äôt stop their price from rising over 1,200% in the past year.

[Nikola](https://www.bing.com/search?q=nikola+stock&qs=LS&pq=nikola+stock&sc=6-12&cvid=DC098EE074A6496FACCDC7B02BFDCE2E&FORM=QBRE&sp=1) is trading below its IPO price being more and more revealed as a scam. They claim to have designed their own working truck, but all they have is CGI mockups and a faked video where they rolled the truck down the hill. Engineers have debunked a lot of the claims their founder Trevor Milton made, but in short he claims his stuff does literally double of everything Tesla does in spite having no product or design team or history of the long process of creating that. Plus Trevor Milton resigned in the face of lawsuits and investigations pending. And in spite Nikola itself saying they were ‚Äúhighly dependent on their founder‚Äù Trevor Milton, they are still on Robinhood‚Äôs **100 Most Popular list!**

[Arcimoto](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Arcimoto%20stock&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&pq=arcimoto%20stock&sc=6-14&sk=&cvid=8AB657D7B3D54A39BCE0C00777388A79) is a small company with 95 employees that makes small electric utility vehicles. They‚Äôve only been selling cars for a year, they‚Äôre losing money, but they still have a market cap of 195 million.

[Aryo](https://www.bing.com/search?q=ayro%20stock&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&pq=ayro%20stock&sc=6-10&sk=&cvid=C1CACD62DB384890B47989F02C5D2698) is an engineering sub-contractor specializing in EV. They have six employees, a revenue of zero the last two years, and a market cap of 68 million.

The trend extends to related industries, with nickel and lithium stocks rising alongside anticipation of contracts from EV companies (with disappointingly meager results). And consider that as large a market cap these companies have, they also compete with older motor companies that are making their own EV and hybrid vehicles. On the wind and solar side, they have seen similar growth over the same time period, which is even more telling.

[SolarEdge](https://www.bing.com/search?q=SolarEdge%20stock&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&pq=solaredge%20stock&sc=7-15&sk=&cvid=881BEB5EA020452D8737355C25F7693B), an Israeli innovation company, has risen over 200% in the last year and has a PE of 74.

[Vivent Solar](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Vivent%20Solar%20%20stock&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&pq=vivent%20solar%20stock&sc=6-18&sk=&cvid=EF6DB7BE434F4EFB9F3542386CA62018) has risen over 550% in a year, have under three thousand employees, are going into big debt with their investment, and have a market cap of 5.29 billion.

[Vestas Wind Systems](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Vestas%20Wind%20Systems%20%20stock&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&pq=vestas%20wind%20systems%20stock&sc=7-25&sk=&cvid=D635DB0D4724467F9663C497DBAFF96B) has risen by 118% over the last year, has a PE of 57, a market cap of 32 billion, and only 25,541 employees.

Note these are *utilities companies*, that have years long installation and maintenance contracts with cities who go into decades of debt to install these services. To show how slow the industry moves, my hometown still has a working coal power plant that was built in the late 1920‚Äôs. Sure there‚Äôs new windfarms being built, but this stuff was built to last and it costs a fraction as much to overhaul old stuff than buy new. Ergo the old stuff goes offline slowly, and new investments are made.

This means the rise of the wind and solar industry is **solely due to** **investor sentiment**, not the growth of the industry itself.

&#x200B;

Then science itself comes in.

In strictly performance and economic terms, gas is fundamentally better than renewables. [The main issue](https://youtu.be/Hatav_Rdnno) comes down to energy storage: A gallon of gas contains 13 times more energy by volume than the best lithium ion batteries Tesla has to offer. That same gas has 50 times more energy by weight than lithium ion batteries. Plus, gasoline just goes into a tank and sits there, while batteries are broken into many cells with connective wires and packaging that aren‚Äôt space or weight efficient. Tackling this problem has been Tesla‚Äôs greatest hurdle, as they‚Äôve had issue with [new batteries randomly exploding.](https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/hybrid-electric/a28687473/tesla-model-3-explosion/)

On top of that, electric motors offer a lot less horsepower for a given weight than a gas motor, along with a much lower top speed. Electric motors do offer instant torque, less maintenance requirements, and don‚Äôt need to idle, but that means little to the average consumer. Altogether with current tech an EV user would be limited in the range, weight, and speed he can move things. Where I live I don‚Äôt even have the garage to charge an EV in nor are there charging stations anywhere within 80 miles, and many people live likewise.

This is also why you don‚Äôt see many electric airplanes. The range, speed, and payload are extremely limited.

&#x200B;

Of course, you say ‚ÄúBut the science is moving forward, and we‚Äôre investing it that.‚Äù Two problems:

Gas motor tech is also advancing as companies find ways to improve efficiency and reduce emissions. Of course they are, because not only is it a very good thing to do‚Ä¶ It is a very Profitable thing to do. And why are we complaining when they raise efficiency on the type of vehicle that +95% of people drive?

Next problem is that scientific progress is measured in decades and generations, not months and years. For instance, [projections](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/weve-long-waited-for-fusion-this-reactor-may-finally-deliver-it-fast/ar-BB19A6Xq) have put us 20 years away from fusion power‚Ä¶ ever since the 1960‚Äôs. Much progress has been made, like using giant magnets to force atoms together or complex math to compensate for instability issues, but they still only making marginal improvements when the problem is no one can make self-sustaining fusion. Fusion requires isotopes of hydrogen, the lightest gas in existence. Fusion requires ludicrously high temperatures and/or pressures to work. Fusion creates a nuclear flash. None of the above cooperate with each other at all.

In the case of solar panels, each decade has seen measurable improvement, but the base issues that were there over a century ago when it was just a laboratory novelty still exist. Namely, finite energy from sunlight even if they were 100% efficient (they aren‚Äôt), and the fact each panel is a significant investment. Current research revolves around solving [mystery wear and tear](https://phys.org/news/2019-06-solar-cell-defect-mystery-decades.html) that makes panels lose productivity and also making the panels self-cooling so they don‚Äôt lose efficiency at high temperatures. But still, the up-front costs are debilitating by any measure.

So not only has the market priced in a revolution in the car industry, it has priced in major revolutionary advances in science that can‚Äôt happen anytime soon. I can‚Äôt predict the future, maybe in 50 years new energy storage devises will hit the market using a currently unknown caveat of quantum physics.

But current scientific research reflects what will hit the market in 10-30 years. I mean it, even in military projects it takes that long for something to go from a concept to a weapon. Case in point, according to Ben Rich from Lockheed‚Äôs Skunk Works, the experimental concepts of radar absorbing paint and a radar resistant shape of aircraft were known back in the 1960‚Äôs. His book detailed some of the immense list of tricky technical issues involved in making an actual stealth plane, however.

What generates this bubble? Look at 5 year charts of these stocks and you‚Äôll see the pattern. The started going up last winter, dipped with the Coronavirus crash, and then immediately soared. I ask Why?

1. [Essentials.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/16/focus-on-essential-companies-that-can-get-through-to-the-other-side-jim-cramer-says.html) Institutional investors are looking for high growth stocks safe from Covid induced bankruptcy.

2. [Autists.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/08/17/robinhood-valuation-soars-to-112-billion-with-new-funding-and-record-growth/#282f7699663d) Discount brokers, from Webull to TastyTrade to ThinkorSwim to Interactive Brokers, all have grown a lot, especially in the last year with quarantined and bored people looking for a way to make some money. Even r/wallstreetbets have seen their membership rise significantly over this period. Nothing wrong with that, but what do all these inexperienced investors consider good growth positions in ethical industries? That‚Äôs right, tech stocks and renewables, and the average number of stocks held is two per account. In some circles I follow, I‚Äôve had to explain that day to day changes in the market price does not always reflect the business itself. And I‚Äôve literally seen this question: ‚ÄúWhich should I invest in, Tesla or Apple?‚Äù (FACEPALM)

3. [Hedge Funds.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-fund-darlings-vs-tesla-204030211.html) These guys seek out high risk high reward schemes, and it is known that several capitalized in Tesla‚Äôs meteoric rise and were among the first to bug out. While it varies wildly how these guys make money, the high volumes surrounding the ‚Äúmeme stocks‚Äù would present them with many opportunities.

4. [Venture capitalists.](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-is-a-billionaire-who-doesnt-care-about-money-2020-5) Rich people are no different, and several corporate heads in renewables said they were more concerned about science than making money. Nothing wrong with that, but you see where the market has gone with this?

&#x200B;

But not all hope is lost for those of you who want to invest in renewables; Nuclear energy is seriously undervalued! Again, this is due to public perception effecting investments, and not the science itself. Progress continued to be made in the science even after Chernobyl caused the total halt of reactor construction, and now as old reactors start going offline and new reactors are cheaper, safer, and come in conveniently smaller packages they look more tempting than ever.

Namely, Microsoft and General Electric are partnering to make [NuScale](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200828005299/en/NuScale-Power-History-Small-Modular-Reactor-Receive), a small modular nuclear reactor that can be produced in bulk, shipped as one piece on a semi, installed into bunkers with a crane, and integrated with as many other reactors as you want. The streamlined process brings costs down, and the small size allows for small remote installations to cut their overhead power costs to near zero. So far, only the Pentagon is buying, but it is also just passed a rigorous certification process last week.

Also, [thorium nuclear reactors](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/could-thorium-revive-the-nuclear-energy-industry-1029624977) are becoming a thing. These are a lot less energy efficient, but physically can‚Äôt break down in a lot of the ways uranium plants have historically (I.E. coolant leaks). Technical hurdles remain, but this has been in the works since the 1980‚Äôs and only slowly has it been getting attention.

And yes, nuclear is definitely a great option. From the perspective of energy density, kw per dollar, initial installation costs, and manning costs nukes lead all others by a ridiculously large margin. In fact, one of the biggest costs are actually the extreme safety and security requirements. And used parts have to be disposed of in lead containers and buried deep in a remote desert.

&#x200B;

In my autist opinion, I give an emphatic sell recommendation to the whole renewable industry.

Do I recommend dropping everything and going into nuclear? No, I‚Äôm saying the damage is done with this human error. Someone has already bought at the top, and when the selling starts someone will lose money. This doesn‚Äôt mean renewables are doomed, either. Recall that Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon all weathered the Dot Com Bubble, because the bottom line is the stock market DOES NOT REFLECT THE ECONOMY, it reflects investor confidence.",2020-10-04 01:32:43

NIO looks consolidated and ready for another big run up into October-November,0.89,"Disclaimers: This is a high risk play.  Do your own research.  I got a 14+x bagger off NIO in late August on the same consolidated setup when NIO got several analyst upgrades and leapt 50% before the September deliveries were announced.  There is no guarantee that this same pattern repeats itself even though the price/volume/trend setup is nearly identical.

&#x200B;

This NIO trade is a pure momentum trade, since it appears fully consolidated by price/volume in terms of how its trading range has narrowed, which means that it's prepared for another breakout if good news comes.

The known potential catalysts are the September deliveries which will either be announced on Friday October 2 or Monday-Tuesday October 5-6, and then later on will be the October deliveries/early November earnings date.

The unknown potential catalyst would come from analyst upgrades/downgrades.  These are probably the biggest driver but impossible to predict.

&#x200B;

Why I believe a breakout can happen:  I'm bullish on September deliveries because they announced BaaS (Battery as a Service) in late August which should lower initial prices paid and make their cars appear significantly cheaper for up-front buyers, which should increase sales.  Second, they just started delivery this past week of the cheaper EC6 model (but that will have more of an impact on October).  Note that September only has 30 days, so that means 1 day less of sales.  They've also recently improved capacity of output to 5000 cars per month.

This is also the consumption season in China after some tough months of flooding/exceptional rainfall, so perhaps that seasonality could provide a larger than expected boost to sales figures.

My expectation is that they announce 4200+ sales for September and then 4700+ in October.

&#x200B;

Why the price might break down instead: This is trading way above fundamental values: a 5k monthly car maker trading for $25 billion market cap is laughable (let alone going up another 20+%), we all know the real value here is probably around $5 per share.

Eventually fundamentals will reassert themselves, but given how overpriced/overbought EV stocks are, I don't think that will happen yet, which is why I think the bias is towards another breakout if analysts upgrade the stock after September or October deliveries.

&#x200B;

How to play this: I've been buying a lot of November 20 calls (30/35 strikes) as well as October 16 calls (strikes in the 20-25 range).  If you have TP hands, buy closer ATM calls or January calls.

Note: I'm just using a portion of my profit from my prior NIO play so I'm playing with house money.  Determine your own risk tolerance.

When to exit: I like to take a % off the table at different values (200% gain/400% gain/etc.); if the stock jumps a lot before Friday on sales anticipation, take some off the table because the sales number could be a ""sell the news"" event unless the number is way above 4000.

&#x200B;

Here's the squiggly lines (yes I know TA is basically just nonsense that confirm prior biases but price/volume action have some predictive value).  There's obviously a chance that the stock just moves sideways and nothing happens or the stock breaks down and the call options bleed to zero.

Close on the heels of bigger rival Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) announcing breakthrough developments at its Battery Day, Chinese EV maker Nio Inc ‚Äì ADR (NYSE:NIO) is gearing up for unveiling product enhancements this Friday.

Nio's Charging: Nio will announce at the forthcoming Beijing International Automotive Exhibition 2020 an upgrade plan for its destination rapid charge service, a company spokesperson confirmed to Benzinga.

More details will be released during the press conference scheduled between 9:40 a.m. and 10 a.m. Beijing time, Saturday, the spokesperson said.

This service is part of Nio's Battery-as-a-Service offering the company announced in late August, TheTradable.com reported, citing a company statement through its WeChat account.

""The strategy is being built to further enhance the simplicity of the NIO energy system and enable all electricity consumers to enhance their charging experience, Nio said.

Upgrade to OS: Nio is also expected to announce its navigating function Navigate on Pilot, or NOP, the National Business Daily reported. The NOP feature is an aid for drivers to cruise through scheduled routes. Additionally, the company will announce an upgraded operating system ‚Äì Nio OS 2.7.0.

For next summers purchase, im thinking DAL and CCL as the rona should be mostly under control by then.
  
This is to support my new  retirement strategy for my Roth IRA - go all in on 2 stocks every September that'll atleast double by next September. Then find 2 new stocks and repeat. This year I went with LAC and NIO. Starting with $10k, should have $1.2million in 7 years

Presenting the Autismo 500 ETF (Ticker $ROPE),0.91,"Retard Funds Management LLC (dba r/wallstreetbets) is proud to announce its new partnership with whatever vestige of Deutsche Bank's trading desk that is still afloat.

Spiritual leader of the initiative u/chainsawvasectomy introduced the new ETF by saying ""we have qualitatively analyzed the hivemind of over 420 million posts created by 1.5 million of the top board-certified autismos to bring to the market what we see as a new beta-zero product. Our hard work has resulted in an ETF that gives *normies* a view into the chaos of every r/wsb member with the flexibility to simply push a button to enter and exit."" He continues highlights characteristics of the fund:

* Daily rebalances. A general guideline to this strategy will be simply buying at close and selling at the open. Regardless of profitability, all principal and profits will simply be rolled into further OTM (cheaper) options.
* Buying after >20% run up. This feature was described to allow the normal investor to experience a more pure meaning of FOMO. KODK after 500% buy at the top. NKLA after getting a funding deal from GM? Surely it can go higher. What is this random mattress company that has been shilled over the past month and up 40%? mAtTrEsSeS aRe tHe nEw tEcH.
* Although the index will hold a diversified 500 assets, the initial holdings will encompass 50 names (including popular issues such as TSLA, AAPL, PRPL, NKLA, NIO, TSM, TSLA, TSLA, TSLA, AMD), comprising of 10 options each. Each chain will comprise of 10% to 200% OTM options, with expirations ranging from the immediate week to one month out. During the Zoom Press Conference from his new home at the end of the Woodlawn NY Subway station, Special Adviser u/1R0NYMAN shouted out something along the lines of ""can't go tits up"" and ""risk-free guaranteed"".

A special part of the fund (with size representing 20-30% of the fund's assets) will be dedicated to buying super OTM options with a premium of $0.01. This was later added to the fund upon a majority vote of the autists of r/wsb, with one member reasoning ""FUCK THETA GANG"".

Bull case for INTC,0.77,"So as most of you AMD fanbois know Intel don‚Äôt got 7nm. Yes they‚Äôre behind a generation but CPU performance improved by 15-20%. But honestly I could give a shit less. 

Normies don‚Äôt look at that. Normies see the ‚Äúintel core‚Äù sticker and they‚Äôre sold. They have blind faith because they recognize the brand. To be honest if these companies weren‚Äôt something I paid attention to I probably would have never even known that AMD is ‚Äúbeating‚Äù Intel. Intel‚Äôs core customers know that and that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt think Intel is going to lose much more market share to AMD. Maybe they‚Äôll gain the super dedicated gamers and computer enthusiasts that care about that level of performance. But I don‚Äôt think they represent the vast majority of tech consumers. The average tech consumer doesn‚Äôt give a rats ass. They know Intel so they trust Intel. 

Don‚Äôt believe me? 

Ask anyone that doesn‚Äôt trade/ is a computer enthusiast if they know who INTEL is. Then ask them who AMD is. I‚Äôm certain they‚Äôll only recognize one. 

AMD just doesn‚Äôt have the same level of brand recognition. 

The recent Tech ‚Äúcrash‚Äù dragged intel back to a PE of 9. Meanwhile AMD is chilling at around 160. I find it hard to believe that somehow even though INTC has 10 times the revenue, and retains around 30% if that into NET income (where AMD is at was most recently at a wimpy 8%) that its valued far below AMD. Big fish have been eyeing it. Vanguard bit this quarter. 

On top of that the recent acquisition of Mobileye should catch the attention of you Daddy Musk littles and NIO SIMPS (I don‚Äôt blame you for throwing your life savings at them their cars do look sexy af) As you probably don‚Äôt know the original version of TSLA autopilot ran on Mobileye. Daddy Musk got cocky and advertised the self driving system as being far more autonomous that it was which after a crash cause Mobileye to pull out of their deal with TSLA. If you ask TSLA it‚Äôs because mobileye was unhappy with TSLA taking over some aspects of production. Either way that spells a smart business because they were either avoiding lawsuits or defending their right to their technology. That doesn‚Äôt change the fact that they were Tesla‚Äôs first choice and for good reason. 

Musk is now arguing against the use of a Lidar system saying that ‚Äúanyone relying on Lidar is doomed‚Äù, but Mobileye disagrees. So does Cornell. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/elon-musk-says-driverless-cars-dont-need-lidar-experts-arent-so-sure/%3famp=1

The gist is a camera only system is bound to fail in certain environments and also performs worse in poor lighting. Ultimately if we‚Äôre going to have fully self driving cars they‚Äôre going to need to be able to function in all types of environments including the roads of India and China which is a task that Mobileye is already successfully undertaking. 

Mobileye‚Äôs customers include Nissan, Volkswagen, Cadillac, BMW and NIO. Most of which have agreed to share driving data with Mobileye, which puts them at a massive advantage compared to TSLA. Ultimately a camera only system is bound to eventually fail and in a society that is already skeptical about the safety of autonomous cars. 


According to the degenerates that call themselves analysts INTC has at most a 9% downside if it touches the historical low PEs of 7. But it also has a potential 100% upside. AMD on the other hand could drop all the way down to $8 and still have a higher price to earnings than Intel. But as you already know the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

Intel has been more efficient with their money, they have real brand recognition that I highly doubt AMD will ever achieve. Oh and they‚Äôre currently brining in like 10 times more tendies than AMD. They have a massive economic Moat while AMD barely has one. 

Don‚Äôt trade on emotions trade on fact. And the fact is Intel has a bigger potential upside

Intel isn‚Äôt a fast mover, at these levels it still has a potential downside because the whole sector is shaky but that will only create better buying opportunities.
If it dips lower I‚Äôm going I‚Äôm going to add leaps on top of my existing position. 

Do your own DD-this isn‚Äôt advice-but remember, I‚Äôm right you‚Äôre wrong; say hi to the wife for me.

ANYWAY! We have 2 competitor, as you all know, that might ""take over"" China to be their Tesla... 

We have NIO that is backed up the government, which is neat, and according to the news they might very soon start selling cars in Europe and in the US.

We also have Xpeng that is backed by Alibaba Itself, have struck a deal with Blackberry to be their OS when using their ""cardash computer"".

Intel : the big picture and why I'm bullish on it,0.87,"I will start off my discsussion using a couple of examples where investors/analysts missed the big picture and the company/stock has proven that they're much more than that.

**Microsoft**


In July 2013, Microsoft stock had the biggest drop of the century after reporting their earnings. The stock dropped because of investors disappointment in the Surface RT laptop. They ignored the biggest elephant in the room that is Windows Azure, now known as Microsoft Azure. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing division and it has been the major growth driver for Microsoft. Of course, the CEO change from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella helped but Satya's vision was all about cloud computing and it was completely ignored by investors at that time. 

https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/19/as-shares-fall-12-percent-microsoft-experiences-its-biggest-drop-since-2000/

**Apple**

Back in 2018, investors/analysts were focusing on iPhone X sales figures. Warren Buffett saw the big picture. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said long-term investors of Apple‚Äôs stock shouldn‚Äôt obsess with near-term iPhone sales. ‚ÄúThe idea that you‚Äôre going to spend loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X are going to be sold in a three-month period totally misses the point,‚Äù he stated. His big picture was looking at Apple as a brand and its ecosystem

https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/30/warren-buffett-says-he-bought-just-a-little-more-apple-recently.html

Look at where Microsoft and Apple stocks were then and where they are trading at now.


**Intel**

I'd like to use the same logic for Intel. It dropped 20% after the earnings call last quarter in July. The big picture  Intel's Investors/analysts are  missing is that they are ignoring this industry leader‚Äôs methodical transition into higher growth businesses and focusing solely o solvable supply chain problems ( 10 nm/7 nm transistor density issues). I will not be discussing the fact that AMD/NVidia are using 7 nm process and that Intel isn't. Also, the fact that TSMC will be on 5 nm by the time Intel fixes the 10 nm/7 nm node problems. Those are problems I'm well aware of and they have been beaten to death already. There is nothing I can add to that. I will talk about that later on but in the end as not the focal points. What I'd like to talk about and focus on is the data-centric transformation and its MobilEye division.


**Data Centric Transformation**

Intel in 2019 pivoted from being a PC centric business to a data centric business. The TAM of this is 250 billion dollars. Revenue in this business group has grown from 42% of revenue in 2015 to 51% of revenue over the TTM. While many business transitions result in periods of low performance, as firms switch focus from declining to new businesses, Intel has managed to grow its revenue by 12% compounded annually over the past four years as it better positions itself for future growth.

**Self driving business**

Intel purchased MobilEye in 2015. It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel . Mobileye has a plan to dominate self-driving. Self driving taxis and cars are a big growth business. MobilEye is in a great position to capitalize on this business. Mobileye says it shipped 17.4 million systems last year. Today, over 40 million cars have Mobileye technology installed, and its products have been selected for implementation in serial production of 313 car models from our 27 OEM partners by 2017 (compared to 36 car models across seven OEMs in 2010). Some of the partners include Volkswagen, BMW, Nissan, Ford. It also has partnered with NIO, a Chinese EV company which people have dubbed the Chinese Tesla.

The firm‚Äôs acquisition of Mobileye strategically positions it to build out its driverless technology business as well. In just three years, Mobileye has experienced rapid growth, with revenue increasing from $210 million in 2017 to $879 million in 2019. Its share of automobile semiconductor sales increased from just 0.5% to 1.9% over the same time. If Mobileye continues taking market share in this fast-growing segment, Mobileye‚Äôs could provide a meaningful contribution to Intel‚Äôs operations, as it made up just over 1% of revenue in 2019. ResearchAndMarkets.com expects the autonomous/driverless market to grow 18% compounded annually from 2020 to 2025. Intel is positioned to grow with this new market.

**PC Business**

This is the side of Intel most people immediately associate Intel with. Intel‚Äôs PC-centric business is not something to write-off. There is still a piece of the PC-centric market where Intel has an opportunity to grow: graphics processing units (GPU). Allied Market Research, expects the GPU market to grow from $19.8 billion in 2019 to nearly $201 billion in 2027 or by 34% compounded annually. For example, Intel is aggressively entering the discreet GPU business, which is about 80% of the current GPU market. The iGPU processors codenamed Tiger Lake just released September 2nd. Intel poached AMD's GPU guy Raja Koduri and nVidia's Tom Peterson. Intel hired engineers and marketing experts from Advanced Micro Devices and NVIDIA, the market leader in the space, to assemble a team to develop and rollout the firm‚Äôs Intel Xe GPU.

Intel is also releasing entry level processors. The entry-level processors will be targeted at budget-tier laptops and fanless mini desktops when they launch in early 2021.

https://wccftech.com/intel-jasper-lake-10nm-tremont-atom-cpus-leak-pentium-celeron-skus-2021/


**7 nm/10 nm process**

Since I have your attention until here - I'd like to say one final thing about this debacle. Lot of people assume that Intel's problems with this are due to complacency. Its not. Its due to Intel attempting to achieve and do something others have been unable to do, which is the exact opposite of complacency. Intel tried to use GAAFET for 7 nm when TSMC and Samsung warned Intel not to.  Intel was warned by TSMC and Samsung that the GAA-FET technique is too challenging to implement at this point in time, but Intel‚Äôs pride and persistence led it to stubbornly try and tackle the GAA-FET problem, until it finally conceded this July.

I agree Intel fucked up here but the point I'm trying to make is that this was not due to complacency as widely believed. Intel has a lot of management problems, hostile work environment etc but complacency is not one of them.  Intel never got complacent about its objectives, but it may have gotten complacent about its approaches, methods, and processes.

https://old.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/i8qrx4/intel_exemployee_reveals_insider_details_on/

https://www.dvhardware.net/article73530.html


**Tl/DR; Post Summary / Post Script** : 

I'm perfecty aware that AMD and nVidia are eating Intel's lunch and have better more powerful CPUs/GPUs. However, Intel is much more than that and its other divisions are what will drive future growth. Analysts and investors are missing this big picture.

NIO BaaS is not new and could be just fugazi fizz to prop up the EV market froth,0.55,"In the early part of the decade. TSLA already tried: [https://www.businessinsider.com/teslas-battery-swapping-plan-isnt-working-out-2015-6](https://www.businessinsider.com/teslas-battery-swapping-plan-isnt-working-out-2015-6) and failed.

Its very expensive. It's hard to scale. Harder for the company to maintain. The wear and tear brings additional risks.

Battery needs rare earth materials and many come from conflict zones. There are supply chain risks.

The car body by itself is cheaper compared to battery. Its the battery that is most expensive and important part of EV. So, BaaS is nothing but a cheaper Lease. 

Things working against NIO:

1. Being a Chinese co (both Donnie / Hiden hate china narrative )
2. NIO is a Cayman islands entity with many subsidiaries.  NIO China, NIO US, stake with XPT. 
3. $XPEV, $LI and others EV players  have all raises substantial cash. So, kind of race to the bottom from here to grab market share. Basically all of them are going to be cash incinerators. 
4. It also makes me wonder how their secondary offering and $XPEV were timed so well before market correction. The big guys knew it was the top.
5. The European expansion story is a joke. It is going to be a hard sell in the lands of Porsche, BMW, VW, Daimler, Mercedez. Also, too many regulations. And not to mention the anti-China sentiment running there.
6. TSLA has its own battery tech and it is much more deeper into the tech aspects. NIO outsources manufacturing. NIO is more of tradition auto maker than a battery tech player like TSLA
7.  $F which  sells \~500,000 cars a month and NIO sells \~5000 a month and both have the same market cap which is a bit insane even if you account for EV emerging tech.

Working for NIO:

1. EV is hot. Oil is cold.
2. Lot of money in the system. Many institutional holding it. 
3. Gammer squeeze. similar to  [https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hk7nqe/tesla\_infinity\_call\_gamma\_squeeze/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hk7nqe/tesla_infinity_call_gamma_squeeze/)
4. China is largest EV market.
5. This stonk is cheaper to TSLA and robintards love it. (used to be top of robintrack chart)
6. Mr Xi's backing (has a better printer than JPoW)
7. Battery swap is a secret weapon, which is not priced in, so it moooons
8. I'm stupid to bet against NIO.

For those with deeper understanding of the battery tech. Could you comment on the pros and cons of swapping battery?",2020-09-06 01:18:16
Hypothetical: Selling way OTM put options with 100 shares of a stock as collateral.,0.52,"I‚Äôm looking for some third party degenerate opinions on this strategy if it‚Äôs completely gay, or actually can‚Äôt go tits up.

For example, I have a portfolio of many stocks with 100 plus shares(appl, nio, rkt, etc.). So for the case of this example, let‚Äôs pretend I go with appl. 

Currently appl is trading at $120/share. I have 100 shares already. If I were to use these shares as collateral, and sell a put option for Sept. 16 2022, at the $250 put strike price and it gets filled. I would then receive $13,400 in instant premium credit, yes? To which I could immediately use that buy more stocks, withdraw, yolo, etc.

I firmly believe appl will be well above $250 come Sept. 16 2022. So what am I missing here that would make this go tits up and not work?",2020-09-05 19:20:48
Need some advice from some of you smart retards,0.64,"I've only started trading a couple of weeks ago, and I was doing it just for some extra cash. I don't have enough capital to go full YOLO and buy a green Lambo afterwards, nor I don't have a deep knowledge of how the stocks market works.
I'm an ITU Nurse and I've been working non stop since February with this freaking covid-19. After this hellish months my organisation decided not to compensate us at all, neither financially nor by some extra days off.
So I decided to try my luck in somewhere else. After thinking about it for a while I decided to invest 2,000¬£ in stocks (not all in one go of course, the 2k was my whole capital to invest). I started off with buying a few stocks from Nio, and managed to get into a lucky strick, got a profit of ¬£90 and I was super excited. In the next days I invested only a few stocks at a time and selling at profit (6-20¬£) each time. As soon as the TSLA stocks spit into 5 I was hyped and though ""well I managed to get a profit of 220¬£ so far with several stocks, why not try TSLA since everyone is getting massive profits"".
It was probably my worst mistake.. My goal was to reach 400¬£ profits in total and get out. We have a baby on the way and I wanted to buy some nice things to the baby.
I'm at a loss of 900¬£ and I don't know what to do. Some people are saying to just hold and wait and others are saying to just sell at a loss.
I need some honest advice from you guys if possible.

Story Time On Why Go Leap,0.76,"I buy from 6 months to 1 1/2 year leaps.  Do I get 1000% in a day, no.  Do I lose 100% in a day, no.

I switched to puts at mid Feb, then switched back to calls end Mar.  BABA JD MGM NIO GNC AAPL BLNK PLUG AMD WMT  etc.   Some losses in there, even a bankrupt zero because 20 Busch lights got me to buy into a bankrupt vitamin company one night.  

I understand the YOLO, but you can still kinda YOLO leaps.  If you bought a TSLA option to expire in 1 year in Jan of 2020 for an expiry of 1200 at their top of around 900, you would have shit yourself in March going to 300, but time cures all and you would have made a shit ton.  Why risk the weeklies?  Time kills options.  You can still get rich as fuck waiting 1 year.  If you believe in a company why friggin only believe in them for 1 week?  

Yesterday hit me for 19%, which is not great, but I'm still up over 2000% this year buying long boring tech.  

Look at the all time chart of the dow, nasdaq, etc....do you really think you just bought in at the all time high ever and it will never go over this?  If aliens landed tomorrow and had anal sex with all firstborn, it will still go up.  It always has and always does.  ***There is no real bear, they are just furries.  No claws, no bite, just a fat wannabe that never wins, trying a weird way to fuck other people.***  It's never worked but makes for some interesting 30 second videos.  Take your gay crayons, make some squiggly lines crossing each other, go upstairs out of moms basement to get that shitty folded Papa Johns sandwich pizza thing, take a ride in your purple mustang with neon blue leds underneath, and then blow off some steam proclaiming to your WoW guild that you got next months premium membership covered on Discord.  You are still gay.

TLDR; Don't drink Bush Light and stonks go up, good luck all!

TLDR2; NIO will hit 100 by Jan 2022.  AAPL will hit 200 by Jan 2022.  PTON and PRPL will merge into the most overhyped shit company since the flowbee and fail.  JD will be on the verge of overtaking BABA as the AMZN of China.  Nobody will really remember Sep 3, it will all be about Sep 8 10% massive green hard on.

TLDR3; The big short faggots were in at like 10k, they lost the opportunity to make 30% plus had to pay margins for fucking years, finally made some money, and a year later the shit was over 10k again.  Bulls always win.  MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2020-09-04 08:27:40

$KCAC ‚Äì the next EV play (battery) backed by Volkswagen,0.88,"Solid-state lithium battery maker **QuantumScape** is becoming a publicly traded entity through a merger with special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, Kensington Capital Acquisition (**KCAC**).

Grab your surfboards, autists. It‚Äôs time to ride the next EV wave. Tesla won‚Äôt dominate the market forever. Volkswagen has invested $300M in the company, which will produce all of Volkswagen‚Äôs electric batteries.

Volkswagen is in and so are big boy investors: **Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Jeff Ma, & Richard Branson. They‚Äôve also got former Tesla CTO and founder, JB Straubel on the board** along with a bunch of -former executives from carmarkers including General Motors Co. and Chrysler Group LLC.

Some notable pumps:

The firm‚Äôs technology, along with other industry developments, are key to delivering cheaper and better batteries that will make electric models a ‚Äúrealistic option for every car owner,‚Äù **Bill Gates said** in a blog post.

QuantumScape‚Äôs technology ‚Äúrepresents the most elegant architecture I‚Äôve seen for a lithium-based battery system, and the company has an opportunity to redefine the battery landscape,‚Äù **J.B. Straubel, the Tesla Inc. co-founder** who sits on the developer‚Äôs board.

**It‚Äôs already up 100% today. Isn't the run over?**

Even after this run, it‚Äôs sitting at **less than $5B market cap**. It‚Äôs not unforeseeable that if enough autists have a common goal, these futuristic pump-plays can run for extended periods (see BYND, SPCE, TSLA, PTON).

**There are no options. Where‚Äôs the return?**

But there‚Äôs warrants, which are like options, but they expire in 2027. They might as well expire in 2100 because that time frame is some boomer shit. But the good news is these warrants still provide leverage;

The strike price is $11.50 stock and the warrants are trading around $6 right now. The stock is at $21 after hours so there‚Äôs even some arbitrage to be made just through buying warrants and exercising.

Swinging or hodling the warrants could also be good. **If the market cap went from $5B to even $20B, the stock would be $110, which means your warrants would go from $6 to $100** (and that‚Äôs not even factoring in any time premium from the long expiry).

**The EV craze is real.**

Tesla proved that gasoline powered cars are a thing of the past. To be a cool kid you need an electric vehicle that can drive itself while you ~~get head from your girlfriend~~ furiously wank your 4.3 inch to those massive titties on the 12.3 inch.

The bottom line is that electric vehicles are going to be the next pump and this is a chance to get in early on a stock that has the potential to be the next TSLA. Fuck it, even if it‚Äôs the next NIO ($25B market cap), I‚Äôll be pulling up to Bezos‚Äô rotary club in my new yacht named ""SUCK MY KCAK‚Äù.",2020-09-04 02:45:37

GLD Gang Reasons,0.85,"TLDR: Buy GLD for 2 days (sell before Friday morning NFPs)

Remember that nothing lasts forever - that means tech calls. You just need to rotate in, hold for 5 days, sell and wait for 2 days. 

So what to buy right now? We had a banner week up to yesterday with the ISM Manufacturing report. People are finally unpuckering and selling their <1% yielding treasuries to chase after AAPL, TSLA, ZM, NIO etc etc. When people are greedy, this is time to be fearful because there will be sausage cutting. 

You can guess what will be the next catalyst, but the truth is that yield spikes since 2008 should always be faded. The yield spike has broken down, and has around 2 days to keep bleeding. If you can't trade /ZN futures, GLD is the next best asset.

NIO post great earnings was up 8% then I go in and whoopsie! Rugpull again cause haha I thought I was smart.

After my first 2 encounters with this 'rugpull' terminology I became genuinely scared of doing somewhat all-in's due to the fear of losing big, I've missed out on doubling my portfolio on tesla due to this fear.

However, this year I ""suspect"" that either outcome could lead to some major, more long term moves either up or down. 

I look forward to seeing you guys' thoughts below but here are a few of mine.

* This election is going to be close. According to the [RCP](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/trump-vs-biden-top-battleground-states-2020-vs-2016/) averages Trump is actually ahead of his 2016 polling in battle ground states. Remember that popular vote does not matter. The Electoral College is everything. Trump could lose both Florida and Arizona but still win if the Midwest continues to trend in his direction.
* The uncertainty created by this will lead to some big declines in the days before the election.
* Either victory will be followed by a myriad of lawsuits and a refusal to concede. If you thought the hanging chads in Florida was a fiasco in 2000 just wait.
* A definitive win for Biden (whenever the lawsuits are decided) may not tank the market but will lead to more caution on the part of major investors (Don't expect SPY 420 so soon). A major factor in this will be whether or not Dems take control of the Senate. If Dems control House, Senate, and Presidency then investors will be more skittish than if a Republican Senate remained.
* A Trump victory (after lawsuits) has the potential to unleash more riots in the major cities but would generally be met with a sigh of relief among the big investors. So long as the fight over vote counts goes on don't expect too many Shrek days but once it's definitive the market should react very positively. 

In conclusion the biggest factor in all this may just be the Senate outcome and not the presidency. If Republicans keep the Senate it's possible Investors will warm to Biden quickly because many of his policies won't be enacted. Sure riots in the case of a Trump win would get a lot of media attention if they happen but I doubt wallstreet would be scared off by them.

Daily Market and Options Summary for Aug-26-2020,0.95,"## Daily Synopsis

The S&P 500 (+1.0%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.7%) rallied to fresh record highs on Wednesday, propelled higher by some eye-popping gains in the mega-cap stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased just 0.3%, while the Russell 2000 was left in the dust with a 0.7% decline.

Highlighting a few of the moves: Salesforce (CRM 272.32, +56.27, +26.0%) surged 26% following its earnings report, Facebook (FB 303.91, +23.09, +8.2%) rose 8% on no news, and Netflix (NFLX 547.53, +56.95, +11.6%) rose 11% on no news. Apple (AAPL 506.09, +6.79, +1.4%) and Tesla (TSLA 2153.17, +129.83, +6.4%) were fueled by a pair of Street-high price-target increases.

Consequently, today's leadership came from the S&P 500 communication services (+3.7%), information technology (+2.1%), and consumer discretionary (+1.5%) sectors, which are home to many of the mega-caps. In the afternoon, the gains broadened out to the materials (+1.0%), industrials (+0.1%), and consumer staples (+0.1%) sectors.

Notably, the market internals weren't as bullish. Declining issues outnumbered advancing issues at the NYSE and Nasdaq by a comfortable margin. The biggest laggards were found within the energy (-2.2%), utilities (-1.2%), and real estate (-0.7%) sectors.

In other developments, durable goods orders increased 11.2% m/m in July (consensus +3.9%), and Moderna (MRNA 70.50, +4.25, +6.4%) said its COVID-19 vaccine generated a promising immune response in ten elderly patients.

For some perspective on today's record-setting performance, the S&P 500 finished the day up 58.7% from its March 23 low, up 7.7% for the year, and 13.0% above its 200-day moving average (3079). The latter raises the risk for a technical correction, although the momentum in the market can go on for longer than expected.

U.S. Treasuries finished the day little changed. The 2-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.15%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 92.91. WTI crude futures increased by 0.1% to $43.39/bbl.

Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the second estimate for Q2 GDP, and Pending Home Sales for July on Thursday.

Prudent Investing 101 - Sell the house and put it on Tesla.,0.87,"Sometimes one's wife has a good idea. The house price was looking good. The pension was not. My year of scalping the biotech indexes had been going well, I had moved $60k up to $100k in my trading account.

So, $600k for the house sale. $30k to the realtor. $200k to pay off the mortgage. New house rented @ $2.8k/m.

Loans and cards paid off. $270k from the house sale gets put on Tesla. The 401k gets put on ARKK (since I can't buy stocks in the 401k, but they'll let me trade a 3X index ETF all day - go figure).

Sold 2/3 of the Tesla stock in my trading account this morning and put a bunch back in NIO for shits and giggles. Diversity is good right?

A month after the sale, retirement is looking 10% closer.

Ye with little faith will lose every time as I have,0.95,"2 weeks ago I YOLO'd some random OTM $FB calls in the morning. Watched them skyrocket, then fall back down some. I thought the party was over so I sold out for what was only about a $60 profit. It rebounded right away and kept climbing. Realizing my mistake I bought them all back, and watched it go up. But WAIT. ITS DIPPING. SELL. I sold out again, for another $60 profit. Fast forward to 2 days later where my initial investment would have netted me a gain of about $150,000

Feeling beaten up by my mistake, I bought some more $FB calls a few days later hoping to redeem myself. Facebook plunged and I sold at a loss of about $250. Those calls today would have netted me a few thousand.

My final retard moment for this session is that I bought a $NIO 1/15/21 $14 call a week ago. Feeling doubtful of NIO going up, I sold it for a $40 profit on Monday. Boy do I feel retarded now.

Morale of the story, tech Stonks always go up, grow some diamond hands, and remember my mistakes when you're naked in a bathtub of tendies.

Daily Market and Options Summary for Aug-25-2020,0.95,"**Context -**

The S&P 500 (+0.4%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.8%) rose to record highs today. The market found continued support in the mega-caps following a disappointing consumer confidence report.

Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index dropped to 84.8 in August (consensus 93.0) from 91.7 in July for its lowest reading since May 2014.

Presumably, there were some concerns that the decline in consumer confidence would translate to less consumer spending, absent another round of fiscal stimulus. In addition, the report overshadowed new home sales showing a marked increase of 13.9% m/m in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 901,000 (consensus 787,000).

Amazon (AMZN 3346.49, +39.03, +1.2%), Facebook (FB 280.82, +9.43, +3.5%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1608.22, +20.02, +1.3%), which have performed well throughout the pandemic, posted strong gains after a slow start. Apple (AAPL 499.30, -4.13, -0.8%) was a notable exception.

In key stock news, Salesforce (CRM 216.05, +7.59, +3.6%), Amgen (AMGN 248.22, +12.65, +5.4%), and Honeywell (HON 164.53, +5.16, +3.2%) will replace Exxon Mobil (XOM 40.89, -1.33, -3.2%), Pfizer (PFE 38.41, -0.43, -1.1%), and Raytheon Technologies (RTX 60.95, -0.93, -1.5%) in the Dow 30 average prior to the open on Aug. 31.

The change was enacted to account for Apple's 4:1 stock split, as its lower price would reduce the price-weighted Dow's exposure to the technology sector.

The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 93.01. WTI crude futures rose 1.7%, or $0.72, to $43.33/bbl.

Investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.

"For Nio Bulls, battery swap stations are flawed",0.74,"I've been following electric car development for the last 6 years and I can tell you Nio's battery swap stations and ""battery as a service"" concepts is a flawed business model. At least for passengers cars. It could work for trucks or motorcycles.

1.) Tesla introduced their version of battery swap technology all the way back in 2013, but abandoned that plan for super charger networks. Lower cost and less moving parts that can break down.

2.) If you watch Nio battery swap videos, you will notice there are at least 1-2 technicians making sure the battery swap goes well (you are dealing with high voltage energy packs and lots of moving parts during a battery swap) This means unlike Tesla supercharger networks, the cost of operations are higher for Nio

3.) Battery as a service is flawed...at least for passenger cars. When you buy a Tesla car, any depreciation of the battery packs is on the owners expensive. Where as with Nio that depreciation is at the companies expense. Normally it isn't a big deal as Nio can charge a higher monthly fee to Nio owners, but any battery breakthrough will make these battery packs depreciate a lot more, Tesla won't have to worry because the buyers already paid for the battery.
Also Nio will have to figure out when to take the battery packs out of operations, batteries degrades over time, 5 years from now the battery can maintain between 80% to 90% of its original charge. At which percentage does Nio remove those battery from circulation? Again Tesla won't have to worry about this, as the owner already paid the car in full. 

Where does battery swap make sense? Heavy duty long haul trucks (swapping a truck's battery is quicker than charging a 700 plus kilowatthour pack) and motorcycles like GOGORO (lighter battery means you can swap it by hand)

$TCEHY Tencent nothing is going to stop this train IMO i am all in,1.0,"From what I have read Tencent ( [$TCEHY](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/TCEHY) ) own the following stakes in the below companies This is just a list of some of the ones I recognize there are lots more you can find them in the link I have shared at the end of this post

* 5% of Tesla
* 15% of Nio
* 39% of Sea Limited
* 10% of Universal
* 9% of Spotify
* 40% of Epic Games
* 5% of Reddit
* 2% of Disney
* 12% of Snapchat
* 5% Activision
* 20% of JD\_com

Nearly all of the above companies including Tencent are up over 30% this year or more. Investing in Tencent is a no brainer if you believe that the market is not going to crash anytime soon as they are far too diversified.

Here is something you may not know! There is a company called Prosus NV and they own 31% of Tencent and lots of other companies all internet based.

Prosus market cap is only152b while 31% of tencent would be 192b. So are Prosus undervalued? Prosus also owns stakes in delivery hero, lots of online education companies and one of the worlds largest fintech companies  I think these guys are going to grow massively in the next 2 years.  Check out their investor presentation from just before the pandemic all the under performing holdings would have benefited massively from COVID after this was released  Skip to page 13 for a list of all the companies they own .

All my homeless cash into NIO,1.0,,2020-08-21 15:25:56
Stock split to acquire shit,0.83,"After watching Snake Jazz episode of Rick & Morty. I think Tesla is acquiring NIO and may not go into S&P500. Splitting the stock drove up share price pre-split and also lowers the individual share price post split. Company now has more money in smaller bills (shares) for an acquisition financed by stock. Think about trying to buy gumballs with Benjamins versus quarters.

Feeling like Tesla is going to announce an acquisition of NIO, or CATL (contemporary {jazz?} amperex technology limited) which would suck since CATL doesn‚Äôt trade on US markets. Both partner with CATL (1.2million mile battery), both have production facilities in Shanghai. NIO just announced batteries as a service business model and plans to be in Europe in 2nd half of 2021 (Giga Berlin planned completion is July 2021). ‚ÄúNIO holds more than 1,200 battery swapping patents and has contributed to 17 national industry standards for battery swaps.‚Äù

‚ÄúAcquisition announcements in the late 1990s were often preceded by stock splits. For example, AOL executed a two-for-one stock split on March 17, 1998, and another two-for-one stock split on November 18, 1998. Six days later, on November 24, 1998, AOL announced the acquisition of Netscape for $4.2 billion. A little more than two months after that, AOL announced the acquisition of MovieFone for $484 million.‚Äù 
-Guo, Liu, and Song (2006) ‚ÄòWhy do firms split their stocks before acquisition announcements?‚Äô

More recent examples (All Apple, who knows maybe they are acquiring something big again {look up AR Camerai}, also Apple has ties to CATL as well) 

Apple announced a 7:1 stock split on April 23, 2014. On May 28, 2014 Apple announced to acquire beats music and beats electronics for $3B.

Feb. 11, 2005 Apple announces 2:1 stock split. Apple acquired schemasoft March 23, 2005 then Fingerworks in April.

S&P inclusion could be an outright ruse or perfect storm of the anticipation of inclusion driving up stock price, stock split for inclusion working as two birds one stone for acquisition financing, and pandemic effects on company to be acquired may result in discounted purchase price.

NIO options are literally free money,0.87,"Listen, autists, this trade literally can't go tits up. NIO's IV rank is 2.2. For those of you that don't know what that is, it basically means that IV is very near to the 52 Week Low (the low was achieved last Friday) and will now gradually build up and spike when they announce August sales numbers.

NIO Updates.,0.88,"# First, an apology

First of all, my apologies for the DD that didn't work out. My hunch was correct in that NIO did crush earnings with a perfect report... However, even though the report doesn't have flaws, the market tanks afterward.

* To those that managed to get out by selling early morning, congrats.
* To those who didn't, tough cookies.

These few days, I've been searching for answers... lots of BS on the web... some said it was missed revenue... others claimed insider trading... Another even said Tesla was the reason...

Anyway, I've finally found the real reason.

# Convertible Notes

This is the culprit of the price crash. Based on the past news events of NIO, I found that they issued  ""Short-term Convertible Notes"" multiple times early this year.

[This](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-announces-private-placement-us100-million-short) and [this](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-announces-additional-us100-million-private)

>The notes to be issued to the Purchaser bear zero interest and mature on February 4, 2021. Prior to maturity, the holder of the notes has the right to convert the notes (a) after the six-month anniversary, into ADSs representing Class A ordinary shares of the Company at an initial conversion price of US$3.07 per ADS or (b) upon the completion of a *bona fide* issuance of equity securities of the Company for fundraising purposes, into ADSs representing Class A ordinary shares of the Company at the conversion price derived from such equity financing.

Long story short, there was share dilution happening. There's $200m from notes that are converted into shares at $3.07 each. Don't know how many is sold, but it causes a huge price drop, followed by panic selling... etc... Basically, a domino effect is created and NIO crashed upon having an extremely solid earnings report.

\----

The bad news: NIO calls, they're most likely going down the drain.

On the bright side, I'm suffering too, as a NIO call holder.

Obviously, NIO price can still spike up, because the market behaves like the market... so, do as you will.

\----

# What's Next.

Based on similar news, there are more Convertible Notes reaching ""six (6) months after the issuance date"". This time, the amount is even greater than the previous one... I expect more dilution, AKA price drops.

Frankly, my gut feeling tells me the ""purchasers"" will choose the day when NIO announce August delivery: Price spikes up early morning on news, then goes down like a skydiver without a parachute... It'll be Q2 after-earnings drama all over again.

[https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-announces-us235-million-private-placements-short](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-announces-us235-million-private-placements-short)

>The notes to be issued to the Purchasers bear zero interest and will mature on March 5, 2021. Prior to maturity, holders of the notes have the right to convert either all or part of the principal amount of the notes into Class A ordinary shares (or ADSs) of the Company¬†from September 5, 2020, at a conversion price of US$3.50 per ADS, subject to certain adjustments.

Remember the date: **September 5th.**

NIO price will drop around that day.

Do whatever you will with this information, buy puts, sell calls, short... whatever...

\---

I don't have any positions now, will need to see the price of NIO in Sep.

Also, burned over half my gambling account on the earnings bet, I'm low on gas until EOM, when I reset my gambling acct. Will update if people are interested.

As for why NIO-bull is buying puts... I separate my investment from gambling. I hold NIO shares, so I'm bullish on NIO long term... but that's not going to stop me from playing shorts on the short term.

September 5th, NIO price will most likely drop around that day.",2020-08-14 05:48:39

NIO is actually more compelling than you think,0.81,"**Earlier today JPM upgraded NIO stock to a $14 target. This was literally a $2 stock only 4 months ago. This is just the beginning**


Listen up. If you don't already know, NIO sells electric vehicles. They are rapidly carving out an interesting niche in their home market, China, and have indicated they want to expand elsewhere in Asia and Europe (starting 2021). They absolutely killed Q2 earnings. Here's why now is a good opportunity to load up on calls and shares while NIO is still cheap.

At the risk of repeating what everyone's been saying, I just want to add 2 reasons not yet fully understood.

\- BaaS ""Battery as a Service"". I don't think I've seen anyone explain this properly before, supported by actual real-life figures, so here goes. NIO currently sells a few different electric vehicles but lets take the ES6 as an example, which is their most popular 5-seater mid-size SUV as of late. ES6 is priced at 358k RMB ($51k). Customers can ALREADY choose to buy it without the battery. Doing so reduces the price by 100k RMB, to 258k RMB (which is $37k USD).  This is a saving of $14,000. The customer then leases the battery from NIO which owns and maintains the batteries. For long journeys, customers can already use a network of Swap Stations to change the battery in a few minutes, receiving a battery in good health every single time - they will never need to worry about an ageing battery. There are also different battery capacities available to choose from, all of which have been purposely designed to fit into the same form factor, so a customer can rent a much larger capacity battery as and when needed for a weekend away. NIO opened 142 new Swap Stations in Q2 alone on top of an already vast network. I will caveat this though -  There is some weird government requirement right now in China where buying an electric vehicle sans-battery means the customer is not permitted to then finance the rest of the car, meaning they are forced to pay for the car up front in cash, but NIO has confirmed this restriction will be removed during Q3 as the BaaS business model has finalised all necessary certifications. As a result NIO has guided for a boost of sales in Q3 (the deliveries of which will show up in Q4), as customers will be able to buy the car for dramatically cheaper, and on finance, and leasing the battery on the side for a small monthly payment.

\- Regulatory Credits. NIO makes on average 60,000 RMB ($8.5k) in regulatory credits per vehicle sold. They then sell these for tendies, same as Tesla. Biggest difference here is Tesla includes the credits in their vehicle margin, NIO does not (NIO is on record stating they don't want to potentially mislead by artificially inflating vehicle margin). Rapidly growing sales, rapidly growing tendies.

TLDR; Buy 9/4 15C right up to your Personal Risk Tolerance. Buying volume should increase in NIO over the remainder of August, then on 1st Sep NIO will release their August Delivery figures which will again smash expectations.",2020-08-12 14:16:37
Where Will NIO go?,0.82,"I get that their delivery vehicles were released since July and it was therefore priced in throughout late July and the first week of August.

"Spreading cancer from my balls, to my portfolio, straight into this cringe-post",0.84,"TL;DR - I'm an asshole who shouldn't have been trading options to begin with & now I've lost my only $6k savings after insane & impulsive trading I did about an hour after I was Dx'd w/nut cancer last month.

Two days before my 31st birthday, July 15th, I had an 8am Dr.'s appt where, to my shock, I was diagnosed w/testicular cancer- which has manifested itself as a large, painful tumor on the famile jewels. (I'd thought was a benign cyst.) I returned home shortly later, devastated beyond expression. Now, early had July yielded me *10 winning trades in a row* which was a big factor in this. I failed to appreciate that my success was more **luck** than **skill** and consequently, my head swole up and I got a little too big for my britches, with my confidence exceeding my actual abilities by a long shot. 

When I got home from the doctors office I was acting completely erratic & unstable. I went on WSB and saw Tesla gain porn over and over and over. Days before I'd ordered TSLA calls, but I got cold feet and cancelled it **right before it would've gotten filled**. Well, I did the math saw I would've made almost 100k had I *not* cancelled it and instead let it filled and trusted myself. At this point I got in my head pretty badly, thinking I **knew** *what* to do but I had to overcome my fear and apprehension to do it. FOMO + my state of mind/panic over potentially dying prior to acquiring generational wealth I can leave to my children.
Right then I decided to spend **ALL** of my available cash. About $6,000. I spent it all on ATM & ITM calls from MSFT, NIO, UHS, and RIGL, all had >=6 wks til expiry and looked good to my TA. 2 HRS LATER: the market ***crashed***. Now I am down over $5,000.

I am also unemployed & now have 0 income. My home business failed calamitously, and has straddled me with more debt which has now been growing for 1 year. I also just recently lost my car, after falling behind on my car note. I moved into a rural jobless no-mans-land before starting my home business which means now I am totally isolated, stranded, & without any opportunity at all. My business failed, and some psychiatrist says I have ""major depressive disorder."" I no longer leave my home office, nor do I ever even have a desire to anymore, or do anything at all. Some days I will sit in here all day long, in silence, just holding my head in my hands and hating myself.

Honestly, I think that right now the best thing I can give my family will be my life insurance payout. Rn there are just too many black pills for me to swallow. Any hope for my future is disintegrating rapidly in front of me. Showing up for such a pitiful & pathetic existence like this existential hell I've created for myself is really taking its toll on me. I am very likely to be divorced imo, once I explain where all my $ went to my wife (and I can only imagine the hell I'll catch from my wifes boyfriend Tyrone). 

I'm just having a hard time with this today.. I apologize for my lack of brevity and this entire miserable, verbose, & self-centered post to begin with. I at least hope I've absorbed so much negative energy, chaos, & bad luck that now there is only good luck and positivity left for you & yours who are reading this, and from this day forward you are blessed with happiness, prosperity, and good health.

NIO beats earnings estimate! UP 10% Pre Market,0.92,"Alright you big red dildo smoking autists, here are some key metrics from NIO's Q2 results:

&#x200B;

Q2 2020

**Vehicle sales at 493 M up 139% YoY**... Don't stop baby just a little more

&#x200B;

**General Expenses 131M down 18% YoY**...Holy fuck they've managed to cut their general expenses significantly

&#x200B;

**EBIDTA -164M Up from -470M in Q2 2019**... Thats a big fucking deal. Im so hard.

&#x200B;

**Net Loss 167M vs Net Loss of 479M in Q2 2019**...Keep going faster, harder

&#x200B;

**Revenue growth of 139% YoY**

&#x200B;

**Net Income Growth of 65% YoY**

&#x200B;

**Gross Profit YoY up a whopping 160% (from -73M to + 44M)**... Key metric many people are looking at. This is the first improvement in their gross profit since 2018. Getting harder.

&#x200B;

**EPS is -0.16 vs analysts estimate of -0.24**... Im fucking cumming.

.....................

Biggest improvement so far in any quarter for NIO. **Earnings estimate beat by 30%**.

&#x200B;

Their vehicle deliveries were 10,331 vs 3,823 last quarter!. Q2 2019 they had 3,553 vehicle deliveries. Thats roughly an average of 283% more deliveries. Coupled with their guidance of 11k-15k vehicle deliveries for Q3 of this year I think NIO is the underdog that not enough people have noticed yet so now may be your chance to hop on the tendie train early.

Trading is up 10% pre-market, whatever happens I'm bullish on NIO. With this kind of growth I expect this to be the next (Chinese) Tesla. (Who actually have sales and make money) If you want to switch your red dildos to green dildos buy calls.

Who‚Äôs holding NIO through earnings. Up 5% already. Pretty scared about the run up already.,0.9,"I have Sep $15 C


What to Watch For: 

There‚Äôs really only one metric in Nio‚Äôs Q2 that is likely to move NIO stock. Surprisingly, it‚Äôs not revenue.

That‚Äôs not because revenue doesn‚Äôt matter. Of course it does. Rather, it‚Äôs because that information already is reasonably well-known. Nio has disclosed its deliveries for the quarter, and by model. Given that analysts know the average selling price for the ES6 sport-utility vehicle and the seven-seater ES8, Street consensus for revenue should be reasonably on point.

And it‚Äôs not even certain that loss per share will move the stock, assuming it‚Äôs within a few pennies of expectations. The absolute loss (and Nio will post a loss) matters less than how Nio gets there.

Rather, the critical metric looks to be vehicle margin (gross profit on vehicle sales). Not only has Nio been running at an operating loss, its gross margins on vehicles has been negative. That fact has underpinned the bear case toward the stock. It‚Äôs not only that vehicle margins are negative, but that they‚Äôre negative despite the fact that Nio itself doesn‚Äôt manufacture the vehicles.

Nio expects that margin will improve and in fact turn positive in Q2. Chief executive officer William Li said after Q1 that the metric would exceed 5% in Q2. With deliveries higher than the company expected and the soaring NIO stock price, investors no doubt are expecting upside to that target.

Vehicle margin alone can change the NIO story. An upside surprise to the high single-digits marks a substantial and quick improvement. It sets a path for Nio to get the figure into the double-digits. From there, investors can start modeling in a business that covers operating costs.

But weakness there undercuts a lot of the optimism generated in the past few months. It raises competitive worries. It means Nio is pricing its way to growth. And it brings long-term profitability into question.

You degenerates who have see my last post should pockets some gains from last week. The weak hands are most likely shaken off on Thursday or Friday... I'm to be blamed... Things didn't go as planned. NIO delivery didn't hit 4k... Luckily, it's still better than what market expect, so stock rises, just not as much as I predicted.

Frankly, from my personal point of view, I think that CEO of NIO is a bastard. The factory went down for 5 fucking days... and... there's no news... Nothing!!!! Where did the thousands of workers go? Quarantine? Can't even one of them leak something? This is 2020!!!

\---- 

Anyway, this event led me to some discovery. 

NIO CEO, William Li, seems to have a quirk. For good news on NIO, he'll share it ASAP. Like on July 2, almost right after Q2 finish, he jumps out with a superb quarterly delivery report... ~~It's as if~~  He rushed the report just to get it out ASAP.

For bad news, William Li delays as long as possible. Looking at the earning timing, the later it announce earnings, the worse the result. There was a quarter where NIO's earnings got delayed... the result was beyond terrible... this time, NIO was expected to present earnings on Sept 22... it was brought forward more than a month... what does it mean?

Earnings on 8/11 is going to be great.

"TLRY Earnings, your next best YOLO",0.83,"Look retards. I've been burned by so many DD's in the past, trying to 4x+ the measly 1k in disposable YOLO funds chasing DraftKings, NIO, AMC, tons of bullshit that I would research for 30 minutes and then pray, hit the yahoo message boards to see what the grandparents were saying, and watch my position piss itself down to $0. Typical high risk behavior that I've spent my entire life engaging in. I had no idea what I was doing and suffered from confirmation bias in my research. Moving on. 

TLRY has earnings upcoming on the 10th. I work as an engineer in the commercial cannabis space, and retail and commercial grow ops are booming. Consumers are buying more cannabis, more frequently, and care more about quality with a generalized concern for lung health. Federal and international governments are looking for ways to generate revenue and Tilray is well positioned to be a huge international distributor. Transportation costs are down, storage costs are down, testing costs are down, material costs are down, industry consolidation is happening rapidly and large license and building assets are being acquired rapidly by the leaders (which was their plan all along).

Earnings on the 10th are expected to show a $0.27 loss per share. I think they'll beat these estimates by 30%

Short position as of July is 22 million shares or \~%20 off the float, expecting a huge short squeeze before earnings

Higher realized margins, APHA confirmed record sales in the last 10 days and I expect TLRY to follow suit. Higher margins + competitors in space beating forecasted earnings 

Brendan Kennedy is a Silicon Valley billionaire who I'd let be my step dad.

Position 8/21 $10c purchase at open tomorrow. Look to ride up rest of week for that 3-4x bagger as the price moves to $11-12 before earnings with potential to jump to $20 if EPS is beat by more than 20%.",2020-08-04 20:08:41

DD: WHY NIO WILL BE $20+,0.9,"NIO's recent rally gained a lot of attention as the stock jumped from a stable price of $3 to $10+ and is now beginning to stabilize, but there is so much more room for the stock to grow, as NIO is likely to be the true CHINESE TESLA.

To understand why NIO will rally in the future, it is important to understand NIO's history and rationale for the current rally. NIO was once $5+ but fell back down over a year ago to a low of $1.5, because of three key reasons:

1. NIO's early cars (ES8's) had a recall due to reports of battery fires. This key failure last year caused the stock price to dip a large amount very early.
2. NIO was having liquidity issues burning through large amounts of cash very fast, and many investors feared the company may go bankrupt before turning a profit unless more cash was injected into the company.
3. Investors feared delisting of Chinese stocks due to Trump / China tensions, causing many investors to pull out of Chinese stocks, creating bearish sentiment.

After NIO's Q1 2020 earning calls, the stock fell 5% but the earnings call had valuable information which cleared NIO to run upwards. NIO received a cash injection of $1 billion from several state-owned companies, giving it much more runaway before bankruptcy. Furthermore, NIO's sales projections had shown that buyers no longer feared battery fires/explosions and sales were beginning to rise. While January / February / March sales had deliveries of 1000 cars / month, April sales were at 3000 cars, proving that they were starting to rise in demand. All of this good news caused the stock price to practically triple over the course of three months and now stabilize leading us to now.

Now that we have an understanding of the past, we can now move as to why NIO will grow extremely fast from this point onward. Here are the key reasons why NIO will moon in the future:

1. **NIO is the ONLY luxury car company able to have sales similar to other EV carmakers in China.** Chinese car companies are known more for their reliability and a domestic luxury car retailer has never achieved the success that NIO has had (think toyota, honda, etc.). NIO's car sales of 3000 cars / month and consistently beating projections is proof that NIO's cars are extremely desirable and has potential to be a large scale brand. Every NIO car is $60,000+ USD, which is significantly higher to other EV carmakers in China. NIO's most recent car was the 4th best selling EV car in China.
2. NIO's positioned itself with 2 key ways of uniquely standing out. First, NIO cars have a 3 minute battery swap, meaning that you can carry a spare battery in your car and swap it out with the current battery in 3 minutes. Furthermore, if your car ever dies, you can call NIO and they will personally drive their own charging van to you an charge your car. **The battery swap aspect is a part of NIO that is not even an advantage of owning a TESLA vehicle.** Furthermore, NIO's charging stations are positioned as a lifestyle place with cafe's, a place to work, meaning that charging gives people things to do. While a small advantage, setting up a great charging ecosystem will make more people willing to buy NIO cars specifically.
3. NIO has begun pre-production of their new EC6 vehicle which is set to release in September in direct competition with the TESLA Model Y. **The fact that NIO will have 3 cars in their lineup gives consumers diverse options and this model will be in a slightly lower price range, giving more people the ability to afford it.** Sales of this car have the potential to sky-rocket with the recovering pandemic situation, as NIO has positioned its cars as a sign of status / luxury.
4. NIO has gone through a phase where there is already much brand awareness of the cars around China. **They have 150+ showrooms throughout the country and have solved all of their issues, giving it room to rocket with increasing sales over these next few quarters.** All NIO has left to do is sell cars, which will naturally increase as people begin to look into buying cars post pandemic. Furthermore, NIO cars are EV vehicles and with stricter regulations / encouragement to switch to electric cars, people will naturally turn to NIO for cars in the future. **Furthermore, NIO is looking to expand internationally into Europe and the US, and already has offices there as well.** With this expansion, we can see a dramatic increase of sales in the future.
5. NIO has the backing of the CCP. They have been giving funding since the beginning by the government in an effort to produce a local EV vehicle. **With the battle of international brand such as TESLA, the CCP will want a domestic brand to win this battle and won't mind giving more funding in the future given positive results.**

TLDR: Essentially, while NIO may have just gone through a huge run up, there is huge upside potential within the next 6-12 months. Any good news will make the stock go up and cause another run up. NIO has conquered all its issues in this first half of 2020 and is now just looking to grow. **It has the potential to 2x over the course of the next 6-12 months!**

NIO monthly delivery - Be ready to pump.,0.95,"# It's a new month, time for another round of NIO pumping.

NIO will be revealing their delivering report for July. As per last few months, NIO tend to do this on the first Wed/Thurs of a new month, so my estimated date of pump will be Aug 6... Then again, things may change, so I'll be in on Monday open

\----

# NIO pump takes days.

NIO isn't like most penny stocks, the pump takes days, so at least 14 DTE, preferably more.

* Price on July 1, is below $8, and it peaked at July 10 near $15.
* Price on June 1, is $4.30, and it peaked at June 9 for $6.7.

If you don't have patience or can't count past 7, this is not for you. I know the criteria invalidates 99% of you retards, but that's my perspective of ""how life works""; Get your wife's boyfriend to help if needed.

\---

# Why is there a pump?

Because NIO will most likely do better than expectation. Here are some numbers.

>Apr 2020: 3,155May 2020: 3,436June 2020: 3,740

Delivery numbers went up by around 300 per month, so  we can assume market expectation to be around 4050 for July. Now, if NIO delivers around 4050, it meets expectations = price rise due to constant high growth.

If NIO delivers more, it exceeds expectations = price rise even more.

\---

# So, how many EV did NIO deliver in July?

On July 18, NIO officially stated that the 50,000th NIO production car was officially off the assembly line. Yes, they build their 50,000 EV on July 18.

Unlike other car makers, NIO outsourced its manufacturing... meaning, that'll most likely be ""order on demand"". Building their 50,000 EV means they have 50,000 sales.

Till June 2020, NIO did a total delivery of 46,082 EVs; That's a balance of nearly 4000 EVs left for July. NIO is almost at the ""expectation mark"" on July 18th. With nearly half a month remaining, chances of exceeding expectations is **huge**.

\---

# Priced in?

Well, NIO news isn't obscured. Everyone who knows how to find can find the information. However, do understand that NIO's current price is suppose to be at $13. The reason it's trading lower: someone from Goldman Sachs downgraded NIO with a price target of $7.

This is good in a way because current price has more upwards potential. In addition, most people in the knows, will reverse the BS from GS... I think this is the likely time for the reversal.

By meeting expectation's, I'm expecting NIO to hit higher 13s, while exceeding can elevates it back to ATH or even more, depending on how much it exceeds. Hypothetically speaking, if NIO can deliver over 5,000 in July, breaking $20 is possible.

However, there's always the possibility of another analyst, jumping out with one of those ""underweight"" review; for those not holding long term, expect a dump after the pump.

EV Stocks and Potential Plays,0.67,"With rumors of Tesla being put into the S&P 500 I believe there are some potential plays ahead to make on really any EV stock of your choice.  With Tesla mooning and printing you sexy bulls tendies the entire EV sector has seemed to follow Tesla.  As Tesla spikes companies like NKLA and NIO have seen days with comparative percent gains. The actual DD is quite simple.  There are 5 requirements to be added into the S&P.  

* It must be a US Company  
* The market cap must be $5.3 billion or more
* Company must be at least 50% outstanding shares
* Stock must have an active market and share for a reasonable share price
* It must have positive reported earnings in the most recent quarter as well as over the four most recent quarters.

**The only one of these TSLA is missing is reported earnings.**  TSLA reports earnings on July 22nd and if they are positive this will be the **4th Quarter** in a row that TSLA has been profitable.  There is a group of 9 individuals that meet monthly to evaluate companies in the S&P and to decide if anyone should be added or removed.  Historically, when a company is announced to be added to the S&P their share price **increases** on the good news!  However,  it is also shown historically  that a companies value really **isn't** affected long term by being in the S&P 500.  The price rises on the news and once the company is added it tends to fall to a similar pre-announcement price, maybe a little higher.  

That being said, I believe this is a potential opportunity to ""Buy the rumor, sell the news"".  I also believe that we really have the ability to do this on any of the EV stocks.  Allowing any size account can get in on this.  If TSLA is to be announced to be added to the S&P there is a really good chance the stock price will jump on the news.  I'm going to leave potential option plays for you big sexy bulls to choose and report back on.  However, whether they are all memes, or not I really believe the EV sector is loading up on ink and ready to print some juicy fresh tendies for us. God Speed.",2020-07-19 01:09:10

I read a lot at first because I couldn‚Äôt figure it out at all. After many a YouTube video, I finally decided to open a RH account and use that as a little plaything for some options trading. Put some money in it a few days ago and this morning, I bought a few contracts of a $12 NIO put for bloody nothing.

I sprinkled a little fresh sea salt, cracked black pepper and toasted sesame seeds on top of the cream cheese as well. I like to do that so it‚Äôs seasoned all over and not just on the tops of the bagel. I sat back down at my desk.

Especially since that in Guangzhou, Shanghai, and other provinces, you need to win a lottery in order to get license plates for your car- However if it is a Hybrid or EV, you get your license plates right away. Many of my friends would buy EV for this reason alone. 

As of now, Tesla is very popular in China, however, once better Chinese alternative starts to bear fruit, NIO is very likely to be the car that every Chinese citizen will be required to have when the government  starts to mandate ‚ÄúEV only‚Äù days. 


Just doing some DD and thought I‚Äôd share. I welcome those with negative and bearish outlooks on NIO (with sources) so I may further research your input. Thanks!

How I make money from WSB,0.85,"I see a lot of people make a lot of plays every day, I used to be a guy that would try to make the same moves I'm seeing made on here, I wasn't making money, infact, I was hemorrhaging cash.  So I took a new approach.

I see people saying ""TSLA to the MOON!"" so I buy puts (cha-ching). People say ""NIO going to $25"" I buy puts.  

Now I see ""ZM down to 150!"" You know what that means. I'm on calls for ZM.  It's been my best strategy to date.  Thank you all for the tendies, you're doing the lord's work.",2020-07-16 16:36:49
Journey to Bands,0.27,"So when I started trading, not so long ago, I started with $300. I had lost a majority of it from OTM plays because i didn‚Äôt know what the fuck I was doing. I took a break to focus on school and came back during COVID season. I got 3 contracts of $BAC 35c 2/7 costing .02 a piece. A couple of days later, I sold them at .15 a contract making a total of $39. I was like wow, i can actually do it. I took a break to finish the semester and then joined wsb to start getting gains. From that point up to now, I wanted to earn enough where I could withdraw all the money I put in. The mentality for this would be that if I lost, it would be like I didn‚Äôt really lose (if that makes sense). 

These past couple of weeks have been great, so I thought. I saw a comment about how getting TSLA 1500c 7/10 when the price a contract was around 1.17 would be a great play. I passed because I thought I could buy multiple NIO contracts instead. Regret. In week 2, NIO had that jump and I gained $200, I saw so many diamond emojis in the daily thread so I decided to hold, lost 5% that day. 

From then I saw potential, I was like it‚Äôs going to up uppidy up, no problem. I bought more NIO calls and any DD I thought we‚Äôre good, from the last 2 days I lost roughly 50% my portfolio. I sold most of my calls leaving me around $40 to throw out there.

TL;DR: me turn $40 into big buck, uppy up",2020-07-16 02:47:32

This is my first Broker account I ever opened. I am down 8k lifetime on this account. I am going to run this to 100k by End Of Summer. I have learned alot and have other accounts, but for this blog on /wallstreetbets I am only gonna focus on this Robinhood.

I am a GunSlinger and love making big moves. This is for entertainment purposes. All trolling welcome. As far as your concerned and prove otherwise, I am a degenerate gambler whos down 8k in paycheck deposits. This should be fun.

I have many random positions I just threw on here like I would have back when I started before learning anything. I am going to manage this moving forward using what I have learned. I will trim these down to a few focused positions on Monday and explain those.

A few position explanations. Spy straddle of Monday SPY Puts in case we limit down or something because of virus propaganda push. $50. 7-17 335 calls in case Friday's Pump continues. I expect Vaccine News very soon so will most likely make a $50 Far OTM bet each week for next month or two until we make a 5% in 1 day move. I don't expect us to drop if we don't on monday which is why I bought Monday puts and Friday Calls.

Nio was just pure gamble for momo play in case theres hard correction. No Tech Analysis in this play.

JNJ 7-17's are for momo play as are October Leaps. JNJ is my vaccine play.

Tesla Put Debit spread is simply an example of how I used to rape my self buying stupid debit spreads paying way to much. Although, I think theres legit chance TSLA has a hard drop monday before resuming it's rally.

SLV is simply a momentum play on Silver in case it has a $1 in one day rip. I don't expect SLV to go to $19, but got these in case it runs over $18 in which case I will likely sell these.

XLF puts are just there from something I got months ago and never sold. They will expire worthless.

Same thing for August TTNP calls. Although I expect TTNP to rip eventually. Just don't know when. I got these before Covid crap and just held em.

About to do some DD and look through some charts for this Challange/blog and find some plays for my $266 buying power in case market opens flat.

I look forward to this and this should be lots of fun. Troll away. These plays deserve it.

Always do your own DD, because investing darwinism is thankfully, very, very real.

Okay, so there's been a run of big-ticket scams. Wirecard, luckin coffee, etc. Is NIO a scam? Should Gynese stocks be delisted in american markets? Media swirl, etc.

* For NIO, the risk of fraud is already priced in, and I think that's why we haven't yet seen a near-term massive run into the 20's or 30's--investors are being more cautious

* LESS of a fraud risk than NKLA, which doesn't have a working prototype... doesn't matter the nationality, fraud can come from anywhere in a fomo market that shorts auditing

* Did I mention that NIO makes cars? Also incredible battery and logistics infrastructure, including [batteries that switch out](https://youtu.be/h96RKW9s2Sc) and diagnose your car's health faster than you can fill a tank of gas and take a shit... a point of difference against TSLA

* Really the charging stuff is a huge fucking deal, NIO will [send a van to your car](https://electrek.co/2018/07/26/nio-courting-tesla-owners-mobile-charging-stations-electric-vans/) to give you an hour charge while you're at the grocery buying cheetos. When TSLA introduces battery switching, that is when TSLA becomes mainstream. Me and many others don't buy TSLA because they can't road trip for shit, and that's like, part of being american man

* Really tho, their cars [can talk to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h96RKW9s2Sc) and shit, and China is kinda fucking good at AI so it works, unlike siri, and This guy loves the premium [massage feature at 4:20](https://youtu.be/prNsevvvMQk?t=260)

* Targeted at the bigly-growing gynese luxury market right now of [4.5m millionaires](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/21/china-overtakes-us-in-rankings-of-worlds-richest-people) and will scale to meet broader appeal as they get deeper into the market--copying TSLA's growth strategy exactly

* Now has [massive debt and equity funding](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/29/nio-stock-surges-after-funding-secured-but-there-m.aspx) to rapidly expand in Gyna--not just designing and working with manufacturing partners to build cars but expanding the charging infrastructure too

* Its also got [a beautiful design](https://youtu.be/h96RKW9s2Sc), looks better than TSLA in my opinion, and way better than the toyota pious prius bullshit

* RISK: the largest near-term risk is investor wariness looking take immediate profits which may push the stock down to $10 or less

* RISK: Some have mentioned risk of having partners manufacture, but I don't think that's big deal as this is not a traditional car. It may be a more efficient model of separating tech/design and manufacturing. Charging infrastructure really makes sense as 3rd party though, like oil is to cars.

I'm bullish mid-long term. Stock may dip near-term/lots of IV so buy LEAPs to rest easy (holding NIOc 1/15/21 $20), or if big ballz play the delivery number game (holding NIOc 8/7 $15). [GO GYNAA!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDrfE9I8_hs)

Hard lesson learned on my first option purchases,0.45,"I'm a new trader. I bought my first stock in April and started actively trading in June. I flipped some stocks and ended June 60% up from my original investment. About 3 weeks ago I found NKLA S-1 filing and how more than twice current float(PIPE shares bought at $10, warrants exercisable) is going to be released into the market. There's no way this stock is not going to tank when this happens, I thought, so I decided to buy my first option.

I got my earnings from flipping other stocks and bought NKLA puts. S-1 was filed on 6/15 and I read that on avg, it takes about 25 days for SEC to EFFECT S-1s which lands it at 7/10 estimate EFFECT date. I put half into 7/10 and other half into 7/17. Monday rolls around, NKLA is tanking and I'm like hell yeah, it's tanking this much already, and I saw S-1/A was filed the Wednesday prior, so I bought more 7/10 puts for the big gainz. S-1/A was filed on 7/1 so that means they only need to make minor changes, and it's gotta be EFFECT soon right? Wrong. I waited every day this week hoping for the EFFECT to show up on SEC filings and nope. I checked the other EFFECT filings that were released every day and most of them had original filing dates that were new than NKLA. I got pissed and sold off my other bags which I had failed to flip and yolo'd it all into 7/17 exp puts. There were 2 chances for me to close out at profit when NKLA tanked for the 7/10 exp, but I held on thinking this EFFECT could come any day now for the big gainz.

Today I'm 50% down from my original investment from 60% up. At this point, I'm almost convinced SEC is delaying NKLA's S-1 on purpose for the benefit of some big moneys out there. I bet on two things: SEC being semi-early/on-time and PIPE investors selling off.(First was iffy, but second seemed likely) I was looking at 500%+ gains if everything went right. I should've played safer, but I was chasing the big gains and 7/17 exp puts were my ""safety net lol"". If EFFECT is filed next week and NKLA tanks, I will be back up in the green possibly way high up in the green. If no EFFECT next week or NKLA doesn't tank, I'll be prob down \~90% from my original investment, and it'll be a hard lesson learned. (when I bought in the second time, I was debating between putting more into NKLA puts or buying NIO calls $10 strike for a dollar each. When I checked yesterday, NIO calls that I would've bought for $1 were $4+.) Just adding salt to the wound..

Anyways, this may not be the right sub to say this, but play safe out there people. I've got my fingers crossed for next week Thanks for reading my story and this was a new trader's first wallstreetbet gone wrong.

Why NIO still has room to run,0.79,"The first case for NIO is that it is coat ailing off of Tesla‚Äôs insane run. Many RH users will come to it as they the can‚Äôt afford the premiums on Tesla or share prices. 

The second case is that Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, and the China International Capital Corperation all have a 30-day option to purchase up to 9 million. Thats 27 million shares that will most likely be purchased if it continues momentum. 

The third case is that this is a Chinese company and although this presents risks (see current political climate) I feel the nationalistic nature of China will be to do everything to make NIO rival the US Tesla.

>""The dollar has also been weaker over the past five days so emerging markets, led by China, normally does well on that back of that.""  
Mizuho strategist Ken Cheung said the rising level of margin financing in mainland China, which was worth 22 trillion yuan (US$3.1 trillion) in June, double the amount in February, would remain a key factor in the direction of the onshore equities market.  
""It appears that the margin financing will be the most important driver for a bullish A-share market,"" he wrote in a research note.  
The China Securities Journal wrote on Monday that China needed a bull market to help fund it a rapidly developing digital economy.

Tesla is undervalued at $1200.,0.81,"I bought my first TSLA shares on IPO day amid everyone from Jim Cramer to auto industry friends making compelling counterarguments:

* ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt make a profit/They‚Äôre hemorrhaging money.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúOther car companies are going to make electric cars and eat their lunch.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúWhat are you, fucking stupid?‚Äù

I still have those shares, and many more I bought along the way. I think it is more than a $1200/share company, and this is my optimistic justification.

1. Tesla has more or less consistently maintained a decent gross margin, usually higher than most other automotive companies. They‚Äôve mostly been in the position where they could be consistently profitable if they only focused on existing products. They‚Äôve seen a huge expansion in the last few years, outfitting and growing the Fremont factory, Nevada‚Äôs factory, Buffalo, and Shanghai, as well as dozens of other small operations around those areas. Germany is coming up, Austin soon, ramping up design, manufacturing, and business employees for new products in automotive, solar, stationary storage‚Ä¶ all that and a consistently increasing revenue, and still people say ‚ÄúThEy LoSt $0.20 PeR ShArE ThEy‚ÄôRe HeMoRrHaGiNg MoNeY‚Äù
2. Electric cars are better. More power, way fewer moving parts, lower total cost of ownership, and there are also mandates by many countries to go all EV. You say that GM and Toyota will start making electric cars and take their share? Car companies are bureaucratic design-by-committee dinosaurs afraid of anything but incremental change. They will forever be one step behind with a worse car that nobody is excited about. People who own Tesla cars love them, and people who don‚Äôt own them want one. Ain‚Äôt nobody excited about the next Corolla. Ain‚Äôt nobody give a fuck what loaf Fiat is pinching off next year. Fifteen years from now Tesla will absolutely be worth what Toyota is worth, and probably also a couple other auto companies that won‚Äôt make it. $285B
3. Self driving is coming. Probably not tomorrow, but within the timeframe of investment consideration. Self driving is a data problem, and Tesla has fuckloads more data than anyone else. More than they know what to do with. If a car can safely drive itself, the car manufacturer isn‚Äôt going to sell those cars to Uber. They‚Äôre going to start their own app and slide the entire market cap of ride sharing companies into their own. $100B
4. In a few months, it‚Äôs speculated that Tesla will announce its million-mile battery. This is important for a couple of reasons. It will help them take over the trucking industry with a far cheaper per-mile product ($40B). It also allows the cars to be used for stationary storage. You don‚Äôt need a 400 mile range every day. You almost never need it. Plug in your car at night and charge it up with cheap electricity. Drive to work and plug it in and set your car to sell back some energy at peak hours. This is what some people are speculating battery day will be about. You need what, 15 miles of range to get home? Sell the rest, make some money. Tesla will take something like 30% just like Apple does when you sell an app. Their $40,000 car now has a total cost of ownership less than a $20,000 gas car. You gonna buy a Tesla or a Kia Forte? If this happens, Tesla sells fuckloads more cars, and makes fuckloads more money as an energy selling middle man. 100B
5. Short shorts. 0.005B
6. Stationary storage and solar. Nobody making batteries like Tesla making batteries, and their solar is getting cheaper and growing rapidly. I‚Äôm tired of typing, you're tired of reading. $75B

$600 Billion dollar market cap. $3250 share price.

But what about Ghislaine Maxwell? And what happens when NIO steals all their secrets? What about Elon‚Äôs obviously deteriorating health and the fact that his brother is 2/3rds lizard person? If those things are worrying you, literally reevaluate your entire life.

‚ÄúYou make a compelling argument BonerballsDickfart, but they haven‚Äôt actually done any of that yet.‚Äù Yeah, no fucking shit, investing isn‚Äôt about what‚Äôs done, it‚Äôs about what‚Äôs going to be done. For years, the question was whether or not Tesla could survive and deliver. They just made it through a global pandemic better than any other car company. Investors are realizing all this shit is coming, and that‚Äôs why the stock is shooting up. Am I wrong? Possibly. I did just write 800 words to a subreddit that can‚Äôt be bothered to read the bottom of a Snapple bottle cap. I also probably overdid the addy this morning and I haven‚Äôt taken a shit in two days. It‚Äôs also possible that Elon goes full Howard Hughes, starts pissing in milk jars, names his kid something nonsensical and endorses Kanye West for president.

But what are the odds of that?

China will NOT steal from Tesla to help NIO,0.83,"This was a clickbait title, sorry. China will definitely steal from Tesla, however let me tell you in **3 points** why that's **not gonna help NIO** or anybody else competing with Tesla.

&#x200B;

[ On the left is Tesla's California Factory, which was earlier Toyota's \(observe the stupid complexity as rampant in legacy auto\); on the right is Giga Shanghai \(observe how much innovation Tesla has done to build the next gen facility\) ](https://preview.redd.it/0ldkhwnfdp851.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=12d8e9f0aad153ecbad90abb05124873ab28cf0c)

 **Point 1)** Tesla is currently manufacturing cars in Giga Shanghai Phase-1 building on a general assembly designed specifically for Model 3. This GA could fit inside the building that it fits in because it was specifically designed for it by Tesla. This helped them achieve \~35 gross margin. No other automaker can just ""copy"" another GA. They would need to build the exact same building roughly, manage to copy the exact same GA, figure out a way to get third-rate suppliers to produce exactly the same inventory Tesla is able to procure from first-rate suppliers. This is not like copying to make toasters, there is infinite more complexity involved. 

&#x200B;

[ Tesla's OS ](https://preview.redd.it/pf9dld5kdp851.png?width=319&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3e4fddd39e5a1fc4f312260f6a71e79c36d7667)

[ Tesla's HW3 computer that can run only Tesla software because it checks physically for electronic PGP keys ](https://preview.redd.it/n4zhz1vldp851.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d6fab9e17b3ef5ae49c58ba906c9bbc6d3c1489)

**Point 2)** Please bring your attention to the software which gives Tesla its supreme performance and excitement. Why has China not been able to copy iOS and put it in their local phones? This question almost seems too dumb to ask but this is what you should be asking. Tesla's software is pushed from California, electronically signed and authenticated via Tesla's servers. Soon Tesla will have their own App Store like iOS. Chinese automakers can't just ""copy it"". On top of this fact, recall how iOS runs on Apple's custom chips. This is similar to Tesla. Since last year, all Tesla software is designed specifically to run on their custom computer. Traditional autos can't just ""copy"" just like they can't copy iPhone chips or Intel processors. 

&#x200B;

[ Tesla 2170 cells \(soon these will be only used for energy products, because Tesla is likely to announce in-house cell development on Battery Day in September for their vehicles\) ](https://preview.redd.it/01fzx2hrdp851.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=718b59203377c6c15d5542df9b3044dbcc9c31a9)

**Point 3)** It's all about the batteries. Currently Tesla is the largest consumer of batteries in the world and even they're cell constrained not demand constrained. They cannot get the top tier battery manufacturers to produce top quality batteries fast enough. This is why you've been reading the news of partnerships with CATL, Panasonic, and LG Chem. Other automakers can't just ""copy"" Tesla. They can't just overnight procure the exact same high quality cells in large quantities because all of them went to Tesla. Oh no.",2020-07-03 20:38:27
"NIO got all the way to 17usd, still at 12 in Mexico. Anyone knows why?",1.0,,2020-07-03 18:43:37
DD on $NIO,0.87,"TLDR: Any Call strike in 2021 or 2022

**Detailed DD:**

Almost a penny stock till last month.

It has seen major movement in the last few weeks.

The key catalysts being:

1. Getting $1B semi-govt funding and raising $485m by issuing equity: which takes away the bankruptcy fears which have been driving it down in the recent months. Enough liquidity now till 2022
2. The actual car delivery numbers have sky rocketed in the last 3 months m-o-m and y-o-y

Common misconceptions:

1. Owned by the chinese govt: No it is not owned by the Govt, the investment was by Hefei City Construction and Investment Holding. Think of it similar to the usual tax-breaks and other incentives offered by local county/state govts here, but instead of just giving free money, they are instead taking 24.1% of equity in the new entity created, and in return the province gets a premium car maker to set base and generate employment
2. Nio like all Chinese cars is shit quality: No, based on anecdotal feedback all the Nio models are very premium with great interiors at par with Lexus. Infact in terms of premium feel of interiors and experience, Nio is heads and shoulders above Tesla's low cost plastic feel
3. Battery swap is a deal breaker: Actually Nio cars can be charged using both a Supercharger as well as battery swap.

Some strengths of Nio:

1. Battery swap: It takes away the biggest risk of owning a EV vehicle. Also, the 4 minute battery swap also includes a full diagnostics run in parallel for the car. It can also upgrade systems during the swap. If there is a better generation of batteries in production the car can be upgraded to a better battery with longer miles
2. Supercharger + Battery Swap + Call-anywhere-anytime-support-guarantee where they send a charging vehicle if stranded anywhere
3. Premium positioning: They are positioned at the top end of luxury/premium vehicle space, and the interiors and experience is top-notch
4. Pricing: It is high enough to provide a path to profitability, also only premium segment vehicle to qualify for govt subsidies. Tesla had to reduce its pricing in China to qualify for its base models.
5. Technology: Self driving, AI, voice assistant hardware, 0-60 acceleration and the whole bag of tricks. Battery range and features are almost nearing Tesla
6. Nerd Positioning: Till date NIO's cars hold the world record for fastest EV vehicles, which are not just prototypes, but real cars.
7. Exclusive Community: The car owners don't just buy a car, they get a premium luxury community experience exclusive to NIO owners in multiple cities. Current count: 22 NIO Houses and 55 NIO Spaces in 57 cities in China
8. Low overheads in terms of not owning huge debts and running a production site. They do all R&D and design in-house but outsource all manufacturing, just like Apple
9. New ES8 model launch pretty successful and more exciting models coming soon

&#x200B;

Forward outlook:

1. Currently gross margins are negative, projected to reach unit profitability within this year.
2. It may or may not become a $100 Billion company, but certainly enough juice to stay in the race and go upwards

Risk issues:

1. Accounting frauds or shady stuff unearthed in the future at some time or the other. After Luckin Coffee etc, one can never be sure.
2. Falling out with the manufacturing partner
3. Not being able to scale beyond 4k-5k cars a month

&#x200B;

TLDR:   any call strike in 2021 or 2022. Could be a $100 or $0 stock in the coming years.

Anyways, all this is my take, i am not a financial advisor or such, so do your own research. I have a few $NIO 7c  Jan 2022, and a few Feb 2021 $4c and $5c.

I would be happy to hear more from your DD and correct me if I am wrong!",2020-07-03 15:13:40

# **Market could get a boost as states reopen, but new economic data will show just how bad things got during shutdowns  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/22/market-could-get-a-boost-as-states-reopen-but-new-economic-data-will-show-just-how-bad-things-got-during-shutdowns.html)**
*****
> Stocks are likely to hang on every medical development and the progress of state reopenings, but there will also be some key economic data in the coming week that should provide a glimpse into the depths of the state shutdowns.
*****
> The Fed‚Äôs beige book of economic activity is released Wednesday afternoon. There is also April manufacturing data in durable goods Thursday and April‚Äôs consumer income and spending data Friday. While that should provide an interesting view of how sluggish activity became, the market is expected to focus more on May consumer confidence Tuesday and consumer sentiment Friday.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe backward looking data is not going to get any attention paid to it,‚Äù said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be terrible, and that‚Äôs not going to be a surprise. Confidence has held up pretty well, all things considered. It‚Äôs the PPP and unemployment benefits. People who get some support for income seem to be pretty confident.‚Äù Congress is expected to take up changes to the Paycheck Protection Program for small business when it returns June 1.
*****
> April‚Äôs economic data is expected to be about the worst of the recession, since most state shutdowns extended through a good part of the month, ahead of May reopenings. First quarter gross domestic product is expected to have declined by 4.8% when a second reading is released Wednesday, but for the second quarter, GDP is expected to decline by a median 33.1%, according to CNBC/Moody‚Äôs Analytics Rapid Update, a survey of economists.
*****
> Stocks gained in the past week, though rising tensions between the U.S. and China weighed on the market Thursday and Friday and could become a bigger headwind.
*****
> The S&P 500 was heading for a weekly gain of 3%, its second weekly gain in three. A big catalyst came Monday, when Moderna disclosed positive data from a small group of patients in an early trial, but it was a wild week of trading for the company‚Äôs stock as doubts arose about its limited results. On Friday, however, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the data showed promise and he was cautiously optimistic a vaccine would be developed.
*****
> Astra Zeneca‚Äôs vaccine effort got a boost this week when it received $1 billion from the U.S. Health Department‚Äôs Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to develop a coronavirus vaccine from the University of Oxford.
*****
> With investors focused on vaccines and state reopenings, market winners were the more volatile Russell 2000, up 7.8% for the week and the Dow Transports, up nearly 9.1% as airlines and other reopening stocks rallied. Airlines were up nearly 20% on the week. After a batch of earnings reports, retailers were also higher on the week, with the SPDR S&P Retail ETF up 6% for the week.
*****
> Retailers are again among the companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, as the first quarter reporting season winds down. Costco, Nordstrom, Ulta Beauty and Burlington Stores are some of the names reporting.
*****
> Keon said he is watching the economic reopenings and says the success really depends on the behavior of individuals, and whether there‚Äôs another spike in infections.
*****
> ‚ÄúPeople are still scared,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the personal behavior that‚Äôs going to make a difference to economic behavior. We‚Äôll get back to some semblance of normal. It‚Äôs going to take awhile for people to feel more confident.‚Äù
*****
> He expects to see a rebound of economic activity in the second half of the year, but not a V-shaped recovery.
*****
> ‚ÄúBy the end of the year, if we don‚Äôt get a vaccine, we will have made a lot of progress on a vaccine. I‚Äôm still cautiously optimistic that the market can hang in, and maybe end the year a little bit higher,‚Äù he said.
*****
> One big reopening in the week ahead will be on Tuesday when the iconic NYSE trading floor reopens.

# Weekly Market Performance ‚Äì May 22, 2020: Stocks Solid in the Midst of Health and Political Challenges

> # Equities

> US equities delivered solid returns this week. With three hours to go in the week, all three markets were up almost 3% for the week, with the best performer, once again, the technology-heavy Nasdaq. The small cap Russell 2000 Index enjoyed an impressive rally, with the index returning over 9% for the week. The mid-cap S&P 400 Index also had a solid showing, returning almost 9%.

> Amid ongoing COVID-19 disruptions, rising unemployment, and risks associated with reopening the economy, US stocks continued to rebound. The rally was supported by all 50 states easing restrictions, based on improving COIVD-19 trends. Several timely indicators have pointed to a pickup in economic activity, including higher credit and debit card spending and an increase in travelers based on TSA data. Second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) could contract as much as 30% annualized, but global progress in reopening economies combined with massive stimulus measures point to a potentially strong rebound in the third and fourth quarters.

> ‚ÄúThe S&P 500 just had the second-best 40-day rally ever, with only the returns off the March 2009 lows better,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúNear-term, we have some concerns of a well-deserved pullback, but historically, these huge moves have tended to resolve much higher over the ensuing 6- and 12-month periods.‚Äù

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.22.20-wmp.jpg?ssl=1))**

> In a change of pace, industrials were the top-performing sector for the week, followed by the energy sector. The worst-performing sectors were healthcare and consumer staples, and they posted returns that were slightly negative for the week. Looking at style, large cap value stocks edged out large cap growth for the week.

*****

# Leading Indicators Signal Potential Bottom

> Leading economic indicators are signaling that the pace of economic deterioration may be slowing. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Conference Board‚Äôs Leading Economic Index (LEI), a composite of leading data series, fell 4.4% month over month in April. While this is an undeniably abysmal reading, it is an improvement from the -7.4% in March.

> ‚ÄùThe monthly LEI change tends to bottom early in a recession, and sometimes even before a recession‚Äôs official start,‚Äù said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúStocks are forward looking, so if investors feel confident that the economic damage will not accelerate from here, they may be more willing to put capital to work. We think today‚Äôs LEI number largely confirms April‚Äôs strong moves in the equity markets.‚Äù

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Economic-news-5.22.20.png?ssl=1))**

> The performance of the 10 underlying components in the LEI does indicate some disconnect between financial markets and the real economy. The two largest positive contributors to the headline LEI number this month were stock prices and the interest rate spread, which were buoyed by a swift and robust monetary and fiscal stimulus. Meanwhile, data series related to manufacturing, unemployment, and construction hurt the index, a reflection of the damage done to the parts of the economy in which workers are unable to perform their jobs remotely.

> As local economies begin to reopen, we look for the industries disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 virus to begin to rebound. While this will likely be a bumpy process, progress will likely become evident in future LEI releases and confirm that the worst of the economic declines are behind us. We think this should pave the way for further equity gains over a long-term horizon.

*****

# What Happens When The Bear Ends?

> The incredible rally off the March 23 lows continues for equities, with the S&P 500 Index now up more than 32% in 40 trading days. As impressive as the rally has been, we do have some near-term concerns, as we discussed in Downside Risk Remains. Higher valuations, US-/China relations, weakening technicals, and the historically troublesome summer months all could play a part in potential weakness after the record run.

> ‚ÄúIn 40 trading days, the S&P 500 gained 32%, which is second only to the 40 days off the March 2009 lows,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúLooking back at history shows that after the initial surge off of bear lows, stocks tend to correct about 10%, which is something we could see this time around.‚Äù

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&P 500 rallied nearly 21% in 30 days after all major bear markets. But once those initial rallies ended, there was a correction of more than 10% on average. Bottoms are a process, and as impressive as this run has been, we think the odds are quite high for some type of pullback or correction over the coming months. Thanks to our friends at Strategas Research Partners for the data points below.

# Bottom Line EPS Beat Rate Below Average

> The first quarter earnings reporting period unofficially came to an end earlier this week, and it should be considered quite a success given how well the equity market performed during this time period. Since earnings season began on April 13th, the S&P 500 (SPY) has gained more than 5%. Of course, the market's performance over the last month or so has much more to do with expectations on re-opening than how companies reported in Q1, but all things considered, the sky didn't fall when it came to earnings results.

> In terms of how actual earnings reports came in versus analyst expectations this past earnings season, the trend wasn't all that rosy. We've been tracking ""beat rates"" for more than a decade, which measure the percentage of companies reporting stronger than expected EPS and sales numbers (relative to consensus analyst estimates). Our main ""beat rate"" trackers show beat rates on a rolling 3-month basis -- meaning it looks at all companies that have reported earnings over the last three months and tells you what percentage of them beat analyst estimates.

> Below is a snapshot of both bottom-line EPS and top-line sales beat rates over the last five years as displayed on our website at our ""Earnings Explorer"" page. Notably, bottom-line EPS beat rates have been weakening quite dramatically over the last couple of months since the COVID crisis began. Just this week, the 3-month rolling EPS beat rate dipped below its long-term average of 59.37% dating back to the year 2000.

> On the other hand, top-line sales beat rates haven't taken quite the hit yet. The current sales beat rate stands at 60.67%. While sales on an absolute basis fell dramatically at the end of Q1, the fact that sales beat rates haven't fallen dramatically means companies have at least managed to keep up with analyst expectations. A very weak sales beat rate would have meant companies were reporting numbers even weaker than already dour analyst expectations.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/epsbeats.png))**

> We also have a forward guidance tracker that measures the percentage of companies raising guidance versus the percentage of companies lowering guidance. When this reading turns negative, it means more companies have lowered guidance than raised guidance over the last three months. As shown below, right now our guidance spread stands at -16.08 percentage points, which is the weakest reading we've seen since early 2016.

> One thing we've seen since the COVID crisis began is that more and more companies have withdrawn guidance altogether. It's hard to blame them. The ones that have issued guidance have mostly lowered expectations. While this paints a bleak picture for the future, if you look at this from a ""glass half full"" perspective, it actually leaves much more room for positive surprises down the road.

# S&P 500 Down Five Straight Day After Memorial Day

> Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 25. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off please consider taking time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military. Additionally, consider taking a moment to acknowledge first responders, nurses, doctors, law enforcement, firefighters, essential workers, scientists and everyone else that has tirelessly worked and sacrificed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

> For decades the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market‚Äôs performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still modestly positive. Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, over the last five years S&P 500 has declined. The second trading day after Memorial Day has more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.

# Election-Year June: Candidate Clarity Boosts Performance

> June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 49 years as a rule ranking seventh with a 0.8% average gain, up 27 of 49 years. This contributes to NASDAQ‚Äôs ‚ÄúBest Eight Months‚Äù which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking tenth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.

> In election years since 1950, June‚Äôs performance improves notably. June is the #5 DJIA month in election years averaging a 0.9% gain with a record of twelve advances in seventeen years. For S&P 500, June is #2 with an average gain of 1.3% (14-3 record). Election-year June ranks #4 for NASDAQ and Russell 2000 with average gains of 1.6% and 1.4% respectively. This performance improvement is most likely the result of presidential candidate field being sufficiently narrowed, and the ultimate nominees being identified.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eylarv/straight_from_the_big_short/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

I was subsequently banned (by darshek or whatever that evil Sith‚Äôs name is) for being too bearish. I was told, ‚Äúyou got to relax dude.‚Äù Couldn‚Äôt post but could comment. 

Long story short, TL;DR, I made nothing off of that post because I was tied down in ASHR and NIO puts.

Chinese ADRs: If you can't say something nice...,0.93,"Good weekend autists,

It's Kimchi with a quick little bit of helpful advice (though may be a bit late for those of you $LK bagholders this time around) regarding Chinese ADRs and the first thing you should check before ever diving into a Chinese company.

This isn't a full write-up like my oil contango [explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ft1tz0/carry_on_my_wayward_son_why_term_structure_will/) or my [story-time](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxrc95/hitler_cuckoldry_and_racecars_the_story_of_the/) on the greatest short-squeeze of all time, but don't worry... I have a post in the works on ""Equity Risk Premium: Why Stonks Only Go Up (Until They Don't)"" that should be posted up soon-ish.

**Chinese Stonks**

So there's a subset of you guys who are of the ""all Chinese companies are scams"" mindset... and that's OK. If you don't like quick moving, high octane companies with grandiose expectations of growth... go check out r/investing. I'm sure they'll welcome you with open arms.

That being said, I don't trade Chinese companies at all, but there's a guy on my desk who trades only Chinese companies (ADRs, A-H, etc) and I occasionally go over to shoot the shit when I'm bored at work. We were chatting a few months back (didn't really think much about it back then... recalled the conversation after the $LK debacle) and we ended up on the topic of ADRs

**Conversation**

Kimchi: Dude so $TSLA is fucking killing it... how's $NIO doing?

Chinese Trader: *Blah blah blah...Something about balance between cash crunch and high sales*

Kimchi: What about $BABA? Haven't heard anything lately

Chinese Trader: *Something about transition after Jack Ma retirement*

Kimchi: How about $LK... seems like they're killing $SBUX

Chinese Trader: *Dude.... don't touch $LK*

**Chinese ADRs, Patriotism and Sell-Side Coverage**

The thing about Chinese sell-side companies (and most of the sell-side in Asia) is that they're not typically allowed to say shit about their own. Part of it is b/c they're trying to get business from the companies they cover and part of it is b/c Big Brother typically frowns down on sell reports.

For example... the big boy on the block of ADRs is $BABA. $527bn or so in market cap, it's going to have a couple of companies covering it, right?

[$BABA analyst recommendations](https://preview.redd.it/tklcbk3oxcs41.png?width=1502&format=png&auto=webp&s=fec36ef2522ab289f8f92ae864868640d74e0e2c)

64 public sources w/ 100% buy ratings. Whether that's b/c they really believe $BABA can only go up... or because they want those #JackMaTendies... well who knows.

Ok then... what about another company that's been in the news... $IQ?

[$IQ analyst recommendations](https://preview.redd.it/aum6zm7kycs41.png?width=1504&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f1f55e89cea213c072fb8a94b0a67b4bede58f7)

OK... this is a bit more like it... a couple hold recs, but note that most Chinese sell-side firms still have a ""Buy"" on the name. 23 public ratings on the name.

What about a smaller, shittier company that most people don't know about? Say like a $600m market cap company like $DQ? (Note: Just an example, **not** a recommendation)

[$DQ analyst recommendations](https://preview.redd.it/rdq1ei4fzcs41.png?width=1484&format=png&auto=webp&s=ced031f8875ea8f529b79811dd5659dda2977e60)

OK... now we're getting to a company that's small enough that not too many people cover it. Still all Buys and a couple Chinese sell-side companies covering the name.

So if a micro-cap like $DQ had 12 companies covering it, including 6 Chinese firms... a company like $LK that had a $12bn market cap at its peak should've had a ton more, right? *Wrong.*

[$LK analyst coverage](https://preview.redd.it/bgcpu3841ds41.png?width=1501&format=png&auto=webp&s=2862fee34c9ea760e47555ebee9bf4bf92d13e11)

No major Chinese domestic outside of CICC (and let's be honest... they only do so because they're essentially an SOE) covered the name even though it had a market cap of $12bn (about what $IQ is at right now). 

**If you can't say something nice, don't say nothin' at all**

[Thumper = Chinese sell-side](https://preview.redd.it/6snb39609ds41.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=41a4122eb2474fac85ec4172fb7f4ff399a22ce7)

As can be seen w/ $BABA, $IQ and $DQ... pretty much no Chinese investment bank is going to put out a hold, much less a sell rating on another Chinese company. What they will do (with the exception of a company like CICC) is not rate the company at all. If a super niche, micro-cap name like $DQ can have 12 sell-side guys covering it... it's a major tell that something's rotten in the state of Denmark when a $12bn mkt-cap company only has 6 ratings w/ 3 Chinese ratings (and 2 of those are months old).

Obviously, even the Chinese sell-side guys could be unaware of sketchiness and fraud going on at some of these companies... but if a sufficiently large ADR isn't being covered at all? Don't even think about touching that shit.

**tl;dr:** If a Chinese ADR doesn't have much analyst coverage... it's probably a piece of shit.",2020-04-12 11:00:29

Then proceeded to blow up my account thinking the stock market was gonna crash.

More time goes by and I basically keep losing small amounts of money here and there. Eventually I got down to exactly $4. Saw a post of a guy turning $250 into 60k and was like fuck that guy and immediately deposited $200. All my plays were very cautious (Not really I‚Äôve just got paper hands). I took profits most of the time and exited if I went down too much. If I had just held all my initial positions through to the end I would probably be up to 50k by now as well but who cares.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 16th, 2020.

# **Stocks are expected to see more wild swings, even if Fed makes big policy move  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/13/stocks-are-expected-to-see-more-wild-swings-even-if-fed-makes-big-policy-move.html)**
*****
> Now that stocks have entered a bear market, more wild volatility is expected in the week ahead as investors await a big policy move by the Federal Reserve.
*****
> The Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and Wednesday and is expected by some economists to take its benchmark federal funds target range back to zero, as the economy looks more and more like it could fall into a recession, due to the impact of the coronavirus.
*****
> In the past week, the market was sharply lower but swung wildly in both directions, including the stunning 10% decline in the Dow Thursday, the worst one-day drop since the 1987 market crash followed by Friday‚Äôs 9.3% gain, the best day in more than 11 years.
*****
> The S&P 500 ended up 9.3% Friday at 2,711, its best day since Oct. 28, 2008. The S&P is now 20.2% below its February high.
*****
> Strategists say the market purge is not over, though it could be closer to a bottom, with some expecting the S&P 500 to fall through 2,400 before it finds a floor.
*****
> ‚ÄúYou could say we‚Äôre pricing a garden variety recession,‚Äù said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equities strategist at RBC. ‚ÄúWe come up with a range of 2,300 to 2,600 as recession territory.‚Äù She said the average drop during a recession, since the 1930s, was 32%. The S&P had been as much as 29% off its Feb. 19 high.
*****
> ‚ÄúIf [S&P] went below 2,300, it would be telling you the market is pricing in something worse than a recession, In the financial crisis we lost 57% and in the tech bubble, we lost 49%,‚Äù said Calvasina.
*****
> The S&P 500 was down 8.9% for the week, its worst loss since the week of Feb. 28.
*****
> ‚ÄúI think we needed to get through this week, in particular ‚Äî the one where the country went into shut down and now get the second go around of policy response. If they really do bring out the bazookas we should be darn close‚Äù to the bottom, said Barry Knapp, Ironsides Macroeconomics director of research.
*****
> But strategists also point out that the coronavirus is unpredictable and it is hard to say when it will peak, even though many economists expect a bounce back in economic growth by the fourth quarter.
*****
> President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency Friday, which allows him to tap federal agencies to provide emergency funds and other responses to the crisis. The president also announced the government would buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserves and that 1.4 million test kits would be available in the next week.
*****
> Markets will also be looking for further action, which the Trump administration says could include targeted financial aid to industries that are hard hit, like airlines.
*****
> As communities around the country attempt to stop the spread of the virus, the potential hit to the economy grows. Companies have told workers to work from home, universities are shutting campuses, a handful of states closed public schools, and major sporting and other events have been canceled.
*****
> ‚ÄúIf it indeed is declared a recession, it will really only be a three-month drop in activity,‚Äù said Knapp. ‚ÄúIn 2008, the household sector had the highest debt levels it ever had, and the household sector was in no position to respond to stimulus. This is quite different.‚Äù
*****
> ‚ÄúWe see where are are today is pricing in a recession. It went from a growth scare down to recession territory,‚Äù said Calvasina. She said the market is not ready to move higher yet. ‚ÄúI think something else we‚Äôve got to see in addition to extreme panic ratings from the sentiment indicators, we do need to see the news flow get better on the virus.‚Äù
*****
> Investors will continue to look for more action from Washington, and in the coming week it will also be the Fed‚Äôs policy response that could drive the market.
*****
> ‚ÄúIn light of the continued growth in coronavirus cases in the US and globally, the sharp further tightening in financial conditions, and rising risks to the economic outlook, we now expect the FOMC to cut the funds rate 100bp on March 18, a faster return to the crisis-era 0-0.25% rate than under our previous call for two 50bp steps in March and April,‚Äù Goldman economists wrote.
*****
> The Fed on Thursday announced a significant increase in funds available for its repo operations, to provide liquidity for the short term funding markets. It also said it would purchase a broad range of Treasury securities, across maturities, with the $60 billion it currently uses to buy Treasury bills on a monthly basis.
*****
> Economists say the Fed could announce other policy moves, like purchases of mortgage securities. Some expect it to return to a ‚Äúpatient‚Äù stance, showing a willingness to keep rates extremely low for a long time.
*****
> Analysts have been watching the corporate bond market, where spreads blew out dramatically in the past week, particularly in high yield. Calvasina said she is not yet concerned.
*****
> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got problems in energy. We have problems in some hospitality related industries. There are pockets of stress, but for me, when I look across most S&P companies‚Äô balance sheets are in really good shape,‚Äù Calvasina said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think this is a prolonged sort of downturn.‚Äù

# Signs Of A Washout?

> The S&P 500 Index‚Äôs historic slide continued yesterday, culminating in nearly a 10% loss for the day, and leaving the benchmark index officially in bear market territory, just 16 trading days after setting a record high on February 19. In addition, the S&P 500 has now moved more than 4% each day this week, leaving investors and professionals alike wondering when this volatility could end. While nobody knows for sure, one thing we always look for at market bottoms are signs of extremes, both from a sentiment and price perspective.

> From an anecdotal sentiment perspective, certainly fears of COVID-19 have reached the masses, with travel plans canceled and announcements of major events called off coming nearly every hour. However, investor survey data shows a similar story with the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Investor Sentiment Survey showing the highest percentage of bears since April 2013. In addition, the National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) Exposure Index, which represents the average exposure to US equity markets by the surveyed investment managers, reached its lowest level since September 2015. Following each of those instances, the S&P 500 rallied more than 13% over the next year.

> Another way of gauging sentiment can be from the internals of the market. While the S&P 500 is now well below its 200-day moving average, that doesn‚Äôt mean each stock in the index has moved below its respective 200-day moving average. In fact, regardless of the broad market‚Äôs trend, when less than 20% of the individual components of the index are trading below their 200-day moving averages, it is considered an extreme. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Thursday‚Äôs sell-off left less 6% of the S&P 500 there, a number last seen in March 2009. ‚ÄúThese are truly frightening times,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúHowever, it is important to remember that the signs of panic we are seeing are typically found at or near major market lows.‚Äù

# The Fastest Bear Market Ever

> The historic volatility continues, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average officially setting its fastest move from a new all-time high to a bear market (down 20% from the highs) in the 124-year history of the index. It took only 19 days for this to take place, which is far and away the new record.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-1-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Not to be outdone, the S&P 500 Index is set to close down 20% from all-time highs today, doing this in only 16 days. Again, as of the time we are writing this blog, the S&P 500 is in bear market territory, but there always could be a chance for a late-day rally.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-2.png?ssl=1))**

> ‚ÄúFrom major sports postponing their seasons, to travel bans to Europe, the economic impact of the coronavirus is growing exponentially with each passing day,‚Äù said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúMarkets are pricing in a potential recession and inevitable second quarter slowdown, but it is all about expectations. Should the virus be contained and the worst-case scenarios not materialize, now could be a nice opportunity for longer-term investors.‚Äù

> Last, one of Warren Buffett‚Äôs most famous quotes is, ‚ÄúBe fearful when others are greedy and be fearful when others are fearful.‚Äù We‚Äôve seen many signs of extreme fear the past few days, but the CNN Fear & Greed Index hitting 1 earlier today is quite a historic level of fear. This proprietary indicator looks at multiple inputs (like put/call ratios, momentum, and volatility), but on a scale of 1-100, this morning‚Äôs 1 is the lowest level ever seen, besting the 2 it hit at the lows in December 2018. From a contrarian point of view, this could be quite meaningful.

# Perspectives on Waterfall Declines

> Volatile market action over the several weeks warrants some much needed perspective into the history of these types of waterfall declines. Fortunately, we have this research on hand and have been examining the nature of deep, fast selloffs like we have experience here in early 2020 as well as the nature of the inevitable and often sharp recoveries.

> First of all yes, this time is different ‚Äì and yet it‚Äôs not. The headline causes of each of these historic waterfall declines are all different and yet investor, trader and money manager behavior remains rather similar. Fear has once again exposed the market‚Äôs overvaluation and weaknesses. This time it‚Äôs the fear of the coronavirus pandemic and price war in the oil market that spills over into the rest of the financial.

> Like the previous occurrences of waterfall declines in the table and graphs below the market reacted to fear and sold off fast and hard. It‚Äôs too early to tell if this waterfall decline is over or how fast and far the recovery will be. As we continue to analyze the current situation a thorough review of the history of waterfall declines and their subsequent recoveries should provide some much needed perspective.

# Friday 13th, DJIA Attempting to Recover & End Losing Friday Streak

> Friday is a significant day of the week because it is the last day of trading and positions held over the weekend could be at higher risk of an exogenous event or an unanticipated headline. Pages 143 & 144 of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac 2020 show the difference in Friday performance during bull and bear markets. Friday‚Äôs have been weaker in bear markets.

> However today, on a Friday the 13th of all days, DJIA is fighting to recover some of its losses this week and to end its streak of down Fridays at seven. Down Friday DJIA losing streaks of seven or more, like the current streak, are actually somewhat rare in history. Prior to this year, DJIA has had just six similar or longer down Friday streaks going back to 1950. The last streak of down Fridays was in March and April of 2017. The longest streak lasted nine Fridays beginning on the last Friday of 2000 and lasting into February 2001.

 > In the above chart the 30 trading days before and the 60 trading days after the last six DJIA down Friday losing streaks of seven or more have been plotted to display the average performance before and after the last down Friday of the streak. (There are on average 21 trading days in a typical calendar month) Weakness and lower was the trend during the down Friday streak, but once the streak came to an end, DJIA was higher 60 trading days later.

# Last Stocks Above Their Moving Averages

> The massive declines over the past few weeks have left conditions extremely oversold. As we highlighted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, breadth has been awful while there is no longer a single stock in the S&P 500 that is overbought (1 or more standard deviations above its 50-DMA). In fact, after yesterday's absolute washout, there is only a small handful of stocks that are above their 50 and 200-DMAs. In regards to the 50-DMA, less than 1% of stocks in the S&P 500 are above this average which is the first time that has happened since 2011. The only time in between that saw a similarly weak reading, although not quite hitting that under 1% requirement was back in December of 2018 when 1.19% of stocks were above their 50-DMA. As for the 200-DMA, only 5.59% are above that level. That is the lowest reading since March of 2009.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MAs.png))**

> The average stock is now 26.56% below its 50-day and 24.5% below its 200-day. The table below shows those 22 remaining stocks that are still above their 200-DMAs as of yesterday's close and the few that are also below their 50-DMA. Of these, only Regeneron (REGN), Kroger (KR), Digital Realty Trust (DLR), and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are also above their 50-DMAs. The only other stock in the index that is also above its 50-DMA is Cabot Oil and Gas (COG), though it is 11% below its 200-DMA. While these stocks have all held above their long term moving average recently, only GILD and REGN have risen since the index's high on 2/19.

# Selloff Erases All of US Market Cap Gains Since Election Day 2016

> With the US stock market down nearly 7% yet again today, the total market cap of US companies as measured by the Russell 3,000 has fallen $11.5 trillion in less than a month. On February 19th, total US market cap was just over $35 trillion. It's at $23.8 trillion as of this morning.

> What makes this drop even more noteworthy is that $23.8 trillion was the market cap of US companies on Election Day 2016. At this point in time, all of the market cap gains seen since President Trump's election victory have been wiped out.

# Low Rates Send Mortgage Applications Surging

> Coronavirus fears have broadly sent rates lower over the past month. Currently, the national average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stands at 3.68%; just off the low of 3.55% from earlier in the month. With mortgage rates now basically at their lowest levels since late 2016, homeowners have been quickly enticed to jump on these lower rates.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MRNA.png))**

> Last week, weekly mortgage applications from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed a roughly 15% surge as rates were reaching record lows. In the time since then, the Fed's 50 bps cut came into effect and yields fell even further which led mortgage applications this week to surge 55.4%. That is the highest week over week increase in mortgage applications since November of 2008 when they had risen 112.1%. Outside of that period, we've only seen larger weekly increases a few other times since 1990.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MA-1.png))**

> The spike was driven largely by refinancing applications which rose 78.6% week-over-week. As with the composite, that was the biggest weekly jump in refi applications since the housing bubble. Prior to that, once again you would need to go back to 2001 or the 1990s to find larger weekly increases in mortgage refinance applications.

Manufacturing is everything for China, and if that government system is good at anything it‚Äôs lying through their teeth. With the recent ban of

Corporate China is begging Beijing to lift restrictions on workers because they can‚Äôt hide their losses anymore, all the priced in sick days have been spent. If I could get to China with a shipping container full of Robitussin I‚Äôd probably be rich before getting into international waters.

HOLY GRAIL NIO DD AND YOU,0.92,"Ok listen up NIO currently trading at 4.20. We are 60 days away from 4/20. The number 60 in the bible are important because ""Many offerings were made by the Israelites after¬†Moses set up, anointed and sanctified God's wilderness tabernacle. Sixty rams, along with the same number of male goats and lambs that were a year old, were given as an offering when the altar was dedicated"" and ""Jerusalem's first temple was built by King Solomon, was 60 cubits long by 20 cubits wide by 30 cubits high (1Kings 6:2, 2Chronicles 3:3)."" Think of your capital as the offering to NIO and the EV gods. This will bring great joy and humbleness to the EV gods. And in turn you will be rewarded with eternal life. But if you are not religious then there is still a saving grace. Unlike Istselites, Greeks were also very smart. In Greek mythology, Monday is the¬†day of the week between Sunday and¬†Tuesday. According to the international standard ISO 8601 it¬†is the¬†first day of the week. ... The¬†name¬†of¬†Monday¬†is derived from Old English M≈çnand√¶g and Middle English Monenday, originally a translation of Latin dies lunae ""day of the Moon.""

Game Plan for Monday's Chinese Market,0.95,"According to just about every news outlet, the Chinese government will be infusing 174 billion of liquidity into the market in about 8 hours. 

***News Recap***

If you haven't read it yet, [here's the article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-cenbank/china-to-inject-174-billion-of-liquidity-on-monday-as-markets-reopen-idUSKBN1ZW074).

There is no amount of effort the government can make at this point to prevent the tidal wave of sell-off that will occur. People need their money, companies need to stay afloat. 

The only major affecting factors that could happen, and are not likely, is that the markets do not open again and/or the government prevents stockholders from selling.

> There will be no further delays to the reopening, the securities market regulator said in an interview in the People‚Äôs Daily newspaper on Sunday.

That's one scenario out of the picture. The other is highly, HIGHLY unlikely and in any case, if they did, either it would only add to the surmounting volitility and negative market sentiment. 

What they **are** doing is preventing short selling. See [this article](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-china-shortselling/china-moves-to-limit-short-selling-as-virus-looms-over-market-reopening-idUSL4N2A20FA).

This could potentially pigeonhole additional stockholders and traders into selling. We will see.

***Another Perspective***

Imagine you are a business owner or private citizen in China right now. In many regions, you are barred from working and isolated in an almost house arrest state of affairs. Your finances are unstable because you have been out of work on a mandatory extended vacation while a new strain of virus runs rampant over your country. 

> [‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt work and have no income. I would rather work than stay at home and do nothing,‚Äù said 32-year-old restaurant worker Wu Caixia in Beijing.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health/china-seeks-to-boost-economy-as-first-virus-death-reported-outside-its-borders-idUSKBN1ZW00F)

Now, the markets are opening up, but with restrictions. You can sell. You can buy. You can hold. That's about it. No speculation. No bullshit. You have a straight exit to liquidate and get your money to help you and your family get through this uncertain and fearful time. What do you think people will do?

***What's Going On Now***

Uncertainty of the viral situation is still prevalent according to [this update](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health/china-seeks-to-boost-economy-as-first-virus-death-reported-outside-its-borders-idUSKBN1ZW00F).

> The vice governor of China‚Äôs Hubei province, Xiao Juhua, said the virus outbreak was still ‚Äúsevere and complicated‚Äù.

> Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the risk of further contraction in the region‚Äôs economy, which was buffeted by anti-government protests last year, has increased due to the epidemic.
Catering, retail, tourism and consumer sectors, which have been hit in the last six months, would ‚Äúfall into a deeper winter‚Äù, Chan said.

Many companies are extending their work suspension *voluntarily* through the better part of February.

> China Evergrande Group, the nation‚Äôs third-largest property developer, said in an internal note it would extend its Lunar New Year holiday to Feb. 16, and suspend construction work at all of its 1,246 sites until Feb. 20.

*Evacuations and Travel Bans*

Forgive the extended quote here, but it is pertinent to understand the complexity of the situation and evolution of events as they unfold.

> However, a string of countries have ramped up border controls. Singapore and the United States announced measures on Friday to ban foreign nationals who have recently been to China from entering their territories, and Australia followed suit on Saturday.

> Russia will start evacuating Russian citizens on Monday and Tuesday, Interfax and TASS news agencies reported.

> The Philippines expanded its travel ban to include all foreigners coming from China, widening an earlier restriction that covered only those from Hubei province. Indonesia also barred visitors who have been in China for 14 days.

> More than 100 Germans and family members landed in Frankfurt on Saturday after being evacuated from Wuhan. Two of them had the virus, adding to the eight cases in Germany already in quarantine.
About 250 Indonesians were also evacuated from Hubei.

> Japan plans to send another chartered plane mid-week or later to bring back Japanese nationals who are still in Hubei, its foreign ministry said on Sunday.

> Japan has barred foreigners who have been in Hubei from entering the country. South Korea will impose a similar entry ban from Tuesday, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said.

***What's The Game Plan***

At this point you should already be invested in a variety of shorts on Chinese stock and ETFS. Some of these include:

- Puts on FXI
- Puts on YINN
- Calls on YANG (an inverse fund)

I am a big fan of hedging risk by shorting funds rather than individual stocks, but some of those may include:

- BABA 
- LK
- NIO
- TCEHY

While others may prefer airline stocks or financials, you probably will not go wrong in any case judging by the severity of the current climate.  Chime in and I will update with adding in your choice stocks/funds

*Am I Too Late?*

I don't think so. As things have progressed, the market is looking ripe for additional sell-off. It is likely that you will be able to get in on Monday or another day this week and still profit in the weeks to come. But do understand the risk you are taking having not been ahead of the curve by shorting the market last week.

You may be able to safely short the American markets at this point as well. **Production lines are forecast to be highly disrupted** from companies operating in China.

***Amount To Sell***

Originally my plan for this was to sell off 100% of my puts for tomorrow after Shanghai markets open up. I shifted to 50% late last week and now I am calling a 10-20% sell, to hold the remaining amount for further market sell-off.

This may change, but for now let's stick with it and see how Shanghai markets react later today. I may change my forecast to hold all puts. 

*Early Expiration Puts*

If your puts expire this week, I would highly consider getting out no later than Wednesday to protect yourself from market pushback. I always try to err on the side of caution, but play it by ear. I don't want to see you retards lose on a great play so close to proper execution.

***Final Thoughts***

Remember, Shanghai will be opening at 8:30pm EST today. Set your watches and clench your buttholes, this week should be extremely exciting.

Yours truly, LiquidityMan

Tl;dr - Sell 10-20% of your puts tomorrow, possibly 0% depending on market conditions. Market outlook is uncertain, prime for additional sell-off. May not be too late to get in on shorting the market.

***Updates***

Update: Feb. 2nd, 5pm EST - It looks like the Chinese government has done two additional things:

1. They are moving to prevent their citizens from shorting the stock market.

> China has taken steps to limit short-selling activities as the country‚Äôs financial markets prepare to reopen on Monday amid an outbreak of a new coronavirus, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters

2. They are preventing sales of stock bought on margin.

>  The sources said China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) had issued a verbal directive to brokerages including Citic Securities Co. and China International Capital Corp. to bar their clients from selling borrowed stocks on Feb. 3.

**Update: Feb. 3rd, 1pm EST**

**I completely exited my positions in FXI and entered ASHR. I would suggest to do the same. I made a short PSA [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eyay72/psa_for_chinese_short_sellers/).**",2020-02-02 20:10:36
Short the Chinese Market,0.93,"I have said it and I'm gonna keep on saying it, if you're in any Chinese positions GTFO now and short the Chinese market. This virus is not under control. Stop holding out and get on the winning side. Convert your positions to short.

The Hang Seng market in Hong Kong and TWSE in Taiwan are continuing to tank. It is just a whiff of what is going to happen in Shanghai come Monday. 

Market volatility is brewing and bubbling. 10 days of closed markets in Shanghai have backed up market volatility so high that it is going to come spewing out and spill over to all the other asiatic markets.

It will be equivalent of that scene in Stand By Me when everyone is throwing up on each other except coming out of Chinese companies assholes.

People saying it's already priced in because things are already trading down on other markets are going to be sorely disappointed and left putting vaseline on their anal fissures from getting fucking so hard.

Markets are going to bleed red on Monday. R.I.P. chinese equities.

Get your puts in on anything Chinese. My choices are on index funds. Here's what to play:

- Puts on EWH (cheapest)
- Puts on FXI (cheaper)
- Puts on YINN 
- Calls on YANG (it's an inverse fund)

Once you make your money, consider feeling out the market for the bottom and buy back in on Chinese equities or calls there on out and ride the market back up. 

Despite being a third world country in many parts of the countryside and causing this kind of fucked up market volatility in the first place, China's middle class is larger than the entire population of the United States. You won't lose in the long run by betting on them to succeed. 

My big three stock choices for the next 10 years are:

- Luckin Coffee
- Alibaba
- NIO

"Tesla Is Gonna Make Bank In China, And It's Because of Kung Flu",0.88,"Chinese auto sales are down. Only Toyota Nissan and Honda are managing to tread water.

But Tesla is going to be an exception this year for the auto industry.

After coronavirus, we should see people frantically trying to buy cars because they don't want to take subways. People don't want to be in enclosed areas with thousands of other people. This fear will continue even after the virus is contained. They still need to get around though, and that's where cars come in. 

Problem is that having petrol cars, especially in major cities, comes with large costs that put off people from buying one. EV cars get around a lot of these costs. The biggest incentive is license plate quotas. In Shanghai and Beijing, license plates are on a lottery system and the cost can be almost as much as the car itself. Millions of people will want a car RIGHT NOW, they don't want to wait year after year to win the lotto and get a plate. They don't trust subways and buses, they are scared for the next epidemic, and they want a car as soon as possible. So what do they do?

# They buy an EV.

Tesla is ahead of all other EV companies, even the ones in China. They've undercut NIO, their products are superior to products from BYD, and many of the models by Chinese car companies are built like compliance cars. The XPeng P7 may be able to compete on cost and value, but they don't have the capacity to supply cars to the millions of customers who want an EV this year. 

Tesla has the supercharger network that they are ramping up this year in China. This is a huge advantage over other companies, because a Tesla owner can use both the supercharger network and the current charging network built by the government and third parties. Most people in China live in apartments, with limited access to charging at home so charging infrastructure matters more than most places.

Tesla will be building its own batteries. They don't have to worry about battery constraints as the other competitors do. They're going to be able to bring down the price of the most expensive part of an EV lower than their competitors can acquire, and it's going to get even lower. As scale of production ramps up, Tesla can increase its marginal revenue holding prices constant, because the cost of each Tesla they produce is going down. Labour costs are also cheaper in China. The more China slows down, the slower cost of labour goes up.

The price is right. $46,000 USD seems high, but millions of people in China spend that much just to buy a regular petrol car along with the price of the license plate. Large families (most likely to buy a car because they don't want their kids getting kung flu from the subway) pool their money for large purchases, enabling them to buy houses and cars without financing. 

Out of all EV car companies, Tesla will be the one on top.",2020-01-28 17:19:41
Best Chinese Stocks To Short During The Viral Crisis,0.95,"Let's hear em'!

Plenty of money to made on the crisis, what's your stock of choice to buy puts on and profiteer from people's death and suffering?

I'll throw these in the ring:

- Tencent
- Luckin' Coffee
- Alibaba
- NIO
- Yum China",2020-01-28 08:02:41

Cars made in China - China manufacturing shut down  
Cars sold in China - Major cities where this vehicle are sold are quarantined and shut down

&#x200B;

Stock price shot up on optimism on growing sales.  Q1 has been bad for NIO because of Chinese New Year.....obviously this quarter will be worse than any other Q1.  I literally see 3,000 cars max being sold in Q1.

&#x200B;

Who's buying and holding on to this stock?  Convince me why you aren't a fool.",2020-01-28 04:46:31
Consolidated Chinese Market Virus Guide,0.98,"Ok, so we all know there's the Coronavirus going around. Here's my unsolicited advice:

***What to do right now***

If you own any Chinese stock, get out of your position right now. If you have any calls that expire within the next few weeks, I would strongly advise you exit those as well. Protect yourself from further losses immediately. 

***What to watch for***

Keep your eyes and ears peeled for the apex of viral infection. When numbers of infected peak and level off, you may want to consider getting back into the market. 

***What to buy right now***

Right now buying puts on most individual Chinese stocks and indexes should prove to be fruitful. Better to get them now rather than later.

***What to buy later***

Any stock that was heavily depressed by the news, that you believe is undervalued and will rebound quickly. You may want to also keep an eye on American companies that manufacture in China. If this goes on longer than a week, their production lines will be affected and they will be ripe for buying opportunities later as well.

Some of my favorite stocks at the moment are Chinese. The big three I am most interested in are Luckin' Coffee, NIO and Alibaba. All are in and will continue to be driven into bargain territory this week due to the extended Chinese New Years Holiday and likely even further beyond that.

***What's the buy point***

This is hugely speculative, but here are my predictions on the best buying points for my three mentioned stocks above:

LK:

Attractive: $30,
Get In Now: $20,
Must Buy: $18 and below

NIO:

Attractive: $3,
Buy Now: $2.50,
Throw Your Money At It: $2 and below

BABA:

Attractive: $200,
Buy Now: $160,
Mortgage your home: $135 and below

***What does all of this mean***

It means you have the buying opportunity of the year or possibly even years in these stocks. As long as the virus doesnt kill off too many people, the Chinese economy will bounce back even stronger and your profits will swell along with it. 

***Final Thoughts***

Keep your cool and focus on profiting in these market conditions. Many opportunities are presenting themselves, have the calm sense to realize what they are. I have already eaten losses myself. If you have too, pick yourselves up, pat yourself on the back and get your ass back in the game

Best of luck to all my WSBros and well-wishes to all those who are suffering in China from the direct and indirect effects of the coronavirus.

Edit: formatting, added tl;dr

TL;DR - Exit chinese market immediately, buy after viral apex, profit

Edit: FXI puts also a great idea!

Why NIO is a Better Investment Than Tesla,0.79,"Other than the fact that Tesla is a great company and will undoubtedly do well worldwide in the coming years, I think NIO will give them a run for their money in China and hopefully the rest of the world.

NIO has the opportunity to stand on the shoulder of a giant and do what Tesla has done, but do it better. Let me list off a few points of what's made me bullish as fuck on them:

- Gone from concept to mass production faster than Tesla
- CEO and founder William Li believes they will turn a profit faster than Tesla
- Has NIO Formula E Team, a professional European sports car racing team that has set multiple records at world-reknown racetracks
- Backed by the Chinese fucking government
- First production car to have an interactive proprietary artificial intelligence, NOMI
- Has their own clothing collection, NIO Life
- Fucking in-seat massagers
- 5 minute battery swap stations
- NIO house, a showroom on the first floor with 3 more floors of community center space, look it up!
- 200 planned NIO House/NIO Space showroom openings in 2020
- Developed a driverless car while waiting for driverless tech
- Can literally use Tesla's shared IP to get a competitive edge 
- Shared environmental preservation sentiment as Tesla, their name in Chinese literally means Blue Sky Ahead 
- NIO Service, can charge your car/swap the battery for you while you sleep if your home does not have a charging station
- Cheap as fuck right now because people think they're going to run out of money

They're about to be even more heavily discounted over the next few weeks due to some hick ass bat soup disease. Gettin my money ready to wade deeper into the communist waters of China. You should to! Imagine being able to get into Tesla when it was this cheap. 

Tesla is more than a car company you say? So will NIO be I believe. They, like China, have a far future in mind. They're looking to the horizon while others are looking at today. It's a company I have come to love and will stand by.

Godspeed retards.

NIO currently has 22 NIO House and 62 NIO Space. That's a huge addition if they are committed to it.

Cons for NIO: increased competition

Chinese Market Outlook,0.6,"I am feeling bullish on Chinese companies that are shadowing U.S. company growth in China. Barring any major catastrophes in their society, their economy will continue to flourish.

I think grabbing hold of companies like Luckin' Coffee, Alibaba and possibly NIO will reap massive rewards, especially over the next 5-10 years. 

Obviously the major risks include the possibility of liquidation of foreign assets in these companies and/or your investment surviving some type of governmental restructuring.

I'm willing to these risks for the rewards look plentiful. My strategy may include holding stock positions, but more than likely will be me attempting to profit from option strategies on the continued rise of selected stocks in the Chinese economy.

Short ideas for 2020,0.82,"Figured I would share 6 shorts I like in 2020. 

PTON- Massive trash, likely fades like the many other fitness fads. Timely IPO thinking short late Jan, looking for $15-$20 range. 

NFLX- Decelerating growth in US (richest customer), price cuts in India with an earnings yield of 1% seems like trouble for longs. 6 months and millions to produce content people watch in 3 days is painful for balance sheet that has $12 billion in debt. Think there‚Äôs a chance this never sees highs again. Could easily get cut in half from here. 

NIO- this has no shot. 

TSLA- Won‚Äôt try time this short term, stock valuation is completely disconnected from the underlying business and upward trend in price just reinforces bad investing by longs. Think 2020 growth takes a bit of a hit, thinking stock could start to trade in correlation with business performance in 2020, if so $220s almost certain. 

BYND- fake meat market is 1% of total meat market. I won‚Äôt argue the trend in plant based eating but the business has a ton of work and time to grow into current valuation. Lots of bag holders overhead thinking $35 is likely in 2020. 

MAT- Deteriorating business with terrible management integrity. Business isn‚Äôt worth the debt and potential legal liabilities ahead. Think this should get cut in half from here.

>[The company must have been in business for more than 3 years and have made profits over the last three consecutive years. This requirement also applies to former state-owned enterprises reincorporating as private or public enterprises. In the case of former state-owned enterprises re-established according to the law or founded after implementation of the law and if their issuers are large and medium state owned enterprises, it can be calculated consecutively. The number of shareholders with holdings of values reaching in excess of RMB 1,000 must not be less than 1,000 persons. Publicly offered shares must be more than 25% of the company‚Äôs total share capital. For company whose total share capital exceeds RMB 400 million, the ratio of publicly offered shares must be more than 15%.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Stock_Exchange#Listing_Requirements)

so you need to be profitable for 3 years in China in order to be on the exchange but if i come up with a idea and slap a Chinese name on it. i can raise millions on the U.S. market? 

what's a good idea to ~~scam~~ offer American investors a way to invest in my Chinese company? i need something that's Chinese of American company like Baba is the Chinese Amazon and NIO is a Chinese Tesla.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 23rd, 2019.

# **Week ahead: As stocks struggle to break to new highs, markets could be swayed by Fed speakers, trade  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/20/as-stocks-reach-for-new-highs-markets-could-be-swayed-by-fed-speakers.html)**
*****
> Developments in U.S.-Chinese trade talks and the comments from a host of Fed speakers could be important for markets in the week ahead, as stocks struggle to regain highs.
*****
> The Fed in the past week cut interest rates for the second time in two months, but the latest forecasts of Fed officials showed just how divided they are on the need for future rate cuts. Five wanted deeper cuts, five didn‚Äôt want any cuts and another seven were happy with the Fed‚Äôs action.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe market seems like it‚Äôs pretty jumpy based on what the say. i think it would flip back and forth depending on how the headlines come out,‚Äù said Tom Simons, money market economist at Jefferies. Simons said the focus will also be on the Fed‚Äôs operations in the short-term funding market, after turbulence in the overnight market in the past week temporarily sent some overnight rates sharply higher.
*****
> There are nearly a dozen Fed speakers on the calendar in the coming week, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is not scheduled to speak.
*****
> Trade developments could continue to cause volatility in markets. Reports Friday that Chinese agriculture officials canceled visits to farms in Montana and Nebraska sent stocks lower, for fear it signaled that talks were not making progress.
*****
> Stocks in the past week were lower, with the S&P off about 0.5% to 2,992. The index had been around 1% away from its all-time high for a few weeks.
*****
> ‚ÄúTech that has been out of play and is acting faulty. it‚Äôs now turning into a headwind, and that could cause a problem for the bulls,‚Äù said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen so many mixed signals in the market in quite some time.‚Äù
*****
> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard for the market to make new highs without tech. At best, it‚Äôs concerning when you see key names, like Amazon and Netflix, not just failing to lead but faltering,‚Äù he said. Netflix was down more than 8% for the week, and Amazon was off 2.6%.
*****
> Redler said it was a concern that shares of market leader Microsoft gave up its initial gains and turned negative, soon after it announced a buyback and raised its dividend. ‚ÄúStrength was sold instead of embraced,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat was good news. What are they going to do when bad news happens?‚Äù
*****
> Following the attacks on Saudi Aramco last week, the United Nations General Assembly in New York and meetings around it take on more importance for markets. U.S. and Saudi Arabian officials have said Iran was behind the attack, which knocked a significant amount of Saudi oil production off line. Iran has denied involvement, and Houthi rebels in Yemen have claimed responsibility.
*****
> Iran‚Äô President Hassan Rouhani has been given a visa to travel to New York for the UN. Before the attack on Saudi Arabia last week, President Donald Trump had suggested he would speak to Rouhani but there seems little chance of that now. Oil have been highly volatile, with Brent crude futures up 7% since the attack as Saudi Arabia sought to assure markets that it would be able to bring its operations back on line.
*****
> There is some economic data that will also be important to markets. There is manufacturing PMI Monday, important after ISM manufacturing data showed a contraction in August. Durable goods will also be important on Friday, as will personal consumption data, which includes the Fed‚Äôs preferred inflation indicator, the core PCE deflator.
*****
> ‚ÄúWhat Powell said in his remarks was inflation was below his target,‚Äù said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. ‚ÄúBut even the core PCE deflator is expected to be 1.8, a new high for the year.‚Äù The Fed‚Äôs target inflation rate is 2%, and other inflation measures have been above that, including core CPI.
*****
> The Fed will also be in focus after problems in the overnight funding market, used by banks in need of short term cash. Rates spiked for repo, or repurchase agreements, in a chaotic two-day period Monday and Tuesday. The Fed‚Äôs target fed funds rate also moved above its target range, in an unusual move.
*****
> The market has since calmed after the Fed carried out open market operations to add liquidity to the market. On Friday, it announced three 14-day operations involving $30 billion as well as continued overnight operations of at least $75 billion each.
*****
> ‚ÄúI think the Fed has absolute control over short term rates. It was caught sleeping at the wheel,‚Äù said Chandler.
*****
> Powell said the Fed would monitor the market and take whatever action is needed. The market is considered the basic plumbing for financial markets, where banks who have a short-term need for cash come to fund themselves. The odd spike in rates was viewed as the result of a cash crunch, not a credit crisis.
*****
> Bond market pros have been concerned that the Fed would again see strains in the market at month end, when there‚Äôs more activity in the overnight funding market.
*****
> ‚ÄúIt gets you further past quarter end,‚Äù said Jon Hill, rate strategist at BMO. ‚ÄúA 14-day pushes them further into October. I think nerves will have calmed. The fact you‚Äôll see fed funds print clearly in the range will reassert confidence. These operations will serve as a reminder that the Fed can have absolute control the front end if and when it wants to. This is a good thing.‚Äù
*****
> The funds rate was at 1.90% Thursday, within the target rate range of 1.75% to 2%.
*****
> ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre removing any doubt of their ability to take control of fed funds in the modern framework. They just announced $165 billion over quarter-end , and we may go bigger. They haven‚Äôt done a repo injection in 10 years,‚Äù said Hill.

# S&P 500 down 23 of 29 during week after September options expiration, average loss 0.95%

> The week after September options expiration week, next week, has a dreadful history of declines especially since 1990. The week after September options expiration week has been a nearly constant source of pain with only a few meaningful exceptions over the past 29 years. Substantial and across the board gains have occurred just three times: 1998, 2001, 2010 and 2016 while many more weeks were hit with sizable losses.

> Full stats are in the following sea-of-red table. Average losses since 1990 are even worse; DJIA ‚Äì1.02%, S&P 500 ‚Äì0.95%, NASDAQ ‚Äì0.90% and a sizable ‚Äì1.38% for Russell 2000. End-of-Q3 portfolio restructuring is the most likely explanation for this trend as managers trim summer losers and position for the fourth quarter.

# October Challenging in Pre-Election Years

> October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in point and percentage terms. The term ‚ÄúOctoberphobia‚Äù has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don‚Äôt get whipsawed if it happens.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dcf589120968a5d6057ac1efe410ef3a/cc2da8936980c71c-4d/s400x600/f2a824e6445a02718474d46969d66c27a0fbfc79.jpg))**

> Pre-election year Octobers are ranked second from last for DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ while Russell 2000 is dead last with an average loss of 1.9%. Eliminating gruesome 1987 from the calculation provides only a moderate amount of relief. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for depressed technology and small-cap shares.

# Where‚Äôs That September Volatility?

> September is historically known as one of the worst for stocks, yet in 2019 the S&P 500 Index is up 2.7% so far amid a sea of scary headlines. Incredibly, the S&P 500 has wavered less than 0.1% from its previous close 6 of the past 10 trading sessions, as it consolidates just beneath all-time highs.

> ‚ÄúOver the past two weeks we‚Äôve had the European Central Bank meeting, the Federal Reserve meeting, higher inflation, a historic jump in crude oil, Middle East turmoil, trouble in the repo market, and even multiple NFL quarterbacks sustaining major injuries,‚Äù said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúYet, with all of those scary headlines, stocks are actually in the midst of one of the least volatile two-week stretches we‚Äôve seen in years.‚Äù

> We are quite encouraged by the overall change in market tone we‚Äôve heard recently, with more cyclical names taking the baton and leading, but with the S&P 500 up near our fair value target of 3,000, we would be on the lookout for this sea of tranquility to get rougher at any time. In fact, according to historical calendars, we may need to be on high guard for the second half of September.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, The Second Half of September Can Be Tricky For Stocks, later in the month of September is when we‚Äôve seen seasonal weakness. Things have been going well for equities in the face of some worrisome headlines, but don‚Äôt get complacent, as the calendar could be one of the biggest near-term risks.

# The Fed Hits It Down The Middle

> ‚ÄúHistory does not repeat itself, but it rhymes.‚Äù Mark Twain

> As expected, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs (Fed) policy committee cut its policy rate by 25 basis points (.25%) to a target range of 1.75%‚Äì2%. This comes on the heels of the first rate cut in more than 10 years at the end of July. This cut is somewhat more controversial, however, because the overall U.S. economic data has been improving, and there‚Äôs been a tick higher in inflation.

> One of the most important questions heading into this meeting was how many voting Fed members would support additional rate cuts. There were two dissenting voting members at the July rate cut, and once again there were two votes opposed to today‚Äôs cut‚Äîbut unlike last time, there was also one dissenter who favored a larger 50 basis point (.50%) cut. Materials in the economic projections indicated 10 of 17 participants (which includes non-voting members) did not believe additional cuts would be needed over the remainder of the year, although evolving economic conditions could certainly lead to a shift.

> As the quote from Mark Twain suggests, by looking back at history we can potentially find clues as to what might happen in the future.

> Looking back at the previous two recessions (2001 and 2008), the Fed cut rates 50 basis points (.50%) to kick off the new cycle of rate cuts. We looked back at what the Fed said at the time, and policymakers didn‚Äôt foresee a recession; the larger .50% cut might have been their way of showing how worried they really were at the time. In other words, maybe the Fed knew there potentially was trouble under the surface.

> Compare this with three consecutive 25 basis point (.25%) cuts in the 1995/1996 and 1998 rate cut cycles, which led to continued equity gains and avoided recessions. Given we foresee one more cut this year, could it be another three cuts of 25 basis points (.25%) and then an economic acceleration?

> ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the catch. When the first two cuts in a new cycle of rate cuts are only 25 basis points, this could be the Fed‚Äôs way of truly viewing the cuts as insurance,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúIn fact, the past five cycles of cuts that started with two 25 basis point cuts saw the S&P 500 Index move higher 6 and 12 months later every single time.‚Äù

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Stocks Have Historically Done Well If The First Two Fed Rate Cuts Are 25 Basis Points, the S&P 500 was up an average of 9.7% six months after the second of two 25 basis point cuts to kick off a new cycle of rate cuts. Going out a year, the S&P 500 had gained a very impressive average of 16.7%.

# Strong Start for September, but Second Half Could Bring Trouble

> As of Friday‚Äôs close the market is well above historical average performance in September. DJIA was up nearly 3.1%, S&P 500 was up 2.8%, NASDAQ and Russell 1000 were up 2.7% while Russell 2000 was up 5.6%. Small-caps outperforming large-caps recently is not unusual and they did so again today. However, the second half of September has historically been weaker than the first half. The week after options expiration week can be treacherous with S&P 500 logging 23 weekly losses in 29 years since 1990. End-of-quarter portfolio restructuring, and window dressing can amplify the impacts of any negative headlines.

# Broader Transports Still Outperforming YTD

> With shares of FedEx (FDX) on pace for their second worst earnings reaction day since at least 2001, the Dow Transports, an index in which FDX has a weighting of over 8% (after today's decline), is down close to 2%. Historically, the Transports have been considered a leading indicator of the economy, so the weakness in FDX, and by extension, the Dow Transports, is resulting in heightened concerns over the state of the economy. Looking at the chart below, the picture for the Transports doesn't look pretty. The timing of today's decline couldn't have been worse as it came just as the Transports were attempting to break above the highs from July, but now it just looks like the second lower high this year. Following today's declines, the Dow Transports are up 14.7% YTD which is about five percentage points behind the performance of the S&P 500.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/091819-DJ-Transports1.png))**

> Given the changes in the US economy over time, we've been skeptical of the continued predictive ability of the Transports, but even putting that aside for a moment, a broader look at Transports shows a less pessimistic picture. The chart below shows the performance of the stocks in the S&P 1500 index on an equal-weighted basis so far in 2019. By this measure, today's decline comes after the index made a higher high, and while it's back below those former highs today, with a gain of 20.5% YTD, this broader look at transports is still outperforming the S&P 500 on a YTD basis. It may not be a great picture for this group of transport stocks, but it doesn't really look bad either.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets.",2019-09-21 15:23:07
NIO Q2 Earning DD (9/24),0.94,"Well everyone this is my first DD post. I've invested in Nio since it IPO and you can imagine how rich I am now. I follow this company religiously. I'm a part of the exclusive Nio Shareholders association on Facebook, and get the inside details.

**TLDR: Buy Puts**

Here are my reasons

1. Nio is reporting Q2 earnings just 6 days before their Q3 ends! Normally companies need to report earnings within 45 days of the quarter ending, Nio is long past 45 days. Delaying earnings is never a good sign of confidence.
2. Excerpt from Q1 conference call, q2 will likley have high cash burn, possibly higher then Q1. Wallstreet loves to crash a stock with cash burn.

Question:  ""What is the outlook for the cash burn in future quarters?""

**Louis Hsieh** \-- *Chief Financial Officer*

""Hey, Dan, it's Louis. We expect Q2 cash burn to be a little bit high, but then Q3 and Q4, once ES6 starts delivery, we expect the cash burn to come down relatively quickly.""

3) Low delivers for the Q2 3,553, based off an average sale price of $57,357 per car I'm guessing $204 million in revenue with -7% gross margins. Leaving a 14 million loss on the books, not including unknown operational costs.

4) Nio didn't start layoffs or cost cutting until Q3.

5) Analysis option chains, the market is expecting up to a $1 shift in price. $2.5 > $3.5 range.

6) If your still reading this there has been a buy order sitting at $2.35 for over 100k shares for over a month now, so don't buy puts below $2.5. This market maker will pump this stock up, and it will not break $2.35. As expected its still there today see this photo ( [https://imgur.com/a/kau1o5T](https://imgur.com/a/kau1o5T) )

7)  **2/3rds** of the *Nio Shareholders Association* group think that this stock is going to moon, so inverse them.

I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new holiday-shortened trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 27th, 2019.

# **Trade and the economy have become the new roller coaster for markets  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/24/trade-and-the-economy-have-become-the-new-roller-coaster-for-markets.html)**
*****
> Trade headlines could be a big factor for markets in the week ahead, but investors will also be attuned to fresh inflation data and moves in the bond market, which is flashing new worries about the economy.
*****
> Stocks were on a roller coaster ride in the past week, as markets reacted to worsening trade tensions and concerns that negotiations could be prolonged, causing pain for the global economy. But the bond market‚Äôs move was perhaps even more dramatic, as yields, which move opposite of price, fell to levels last seen in 2017, and the futures market began to price in three Fed interest rate cuts by the end of next year.
*****
> ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not a lot of economic data next week, so events hang over us,‚Äù said Marc Chandler, chief global strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more about the evolution of old issues than new issues, like trade and Brexit.‚Äù
*****
> Brexit will continue to be a focus in global markets. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May stepped aside Friday after failing to get agreement on a plan for the U.K. to leave the European Union. Chandler said investors will be watching the jockeying among candidates hoping to succeed Prime Minister May, with hard line Brexit proponent Boris Johnson expected to seek the job, among others.
*****
> As for trade, Chandler said it‚Äôs possible that President Donald Trump‚Äôs comments that Huawei could be part of a trade deal may be the start of a new approach by the administration to tone down its rhetoric. The telecom giant has been blacklisted by the U.S. and is expected to be denied access to U.S. components for its equipment.
*****
> ‚ÄúIn some ways, it‚Äôs a headline problem. We think of it more as event risk,‚Äù said Nadine Terman, CEO and CIO at Solstein Capital. ‚ÄúChina thinks in dynasties and U.S. investors seem to think in durations of days and months, so I think we are misunderstanding the duration of their negotiating strategy.‚Äù
*****
> She said the issues between the two countries go way beyond trade and extend to China‚Äôs military aspirations in the South China Sea and its global campaign of influence through the Belt and Road initiative, Chinese President Xi Jinping‚Äôs signature program.
*****
> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs now become more nationalistic, emotional, to say: ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre going against the U.S. and we‚Äôve got to be in it for the long haul.‚Äô I don‚Äôt think you have the same emotion here in the U.S. You don‚Äôt have the same nationalistic pride to say ‚Äòwe have to fight China at all cost,‚Äô‚Äù she said.
*****
> In the past week, Wall Street increasingly began to expect the Trump administration to turn up the pressure on China with another wave of 25% tariffs on the $300 billion or so in goods remaining that have no tariffs. Those tariffs would directly hit American consumer goods and are expected to take a bigger bite out of the economy.
*****
> Fears of a trade war hurting global growth and concerns that the U.S. is already beginning to weaken were evident in the bond market. Treasury yields reflected lowered growth expectations. The 10-year hit a low of 2.29% on Thursday and was at 2.32% Friday.
*****
> J.P. Morgan economists Friday downgraded their view of the economy, slicing second quarter growth to just 1% from an earlier forecast of 2.25% and first quarter growth of 3.2%. The economists blamed weak U.S. manufacturing data and said risks were signs of weakness in the global economy and also indications that the trade war was hurting business sentiment.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe concerns the markets have right now are that we‚Äôre moving towards a worst case scenario, and that could persist for quite some time,‚Äù said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rate strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs the case, then the market is believing economic data, and the Fed will likely need to respond to that by trying to offset and prevent a recession.‚Äù
*****
> The most important data point in the coming week will be Friday‚Äôs personal consumption expenditures, which includes the PCE deflator inflation data that the Fed monitors. It was at 1.6% year-over-year last month, and is expected to be the same for April, well below the Fed‚Äôs target of 2% inflation.
*****
> Inflation has become a key focus on Wall Street, particularly after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said low inflation appears to be transitory and not enough of a concern to make the Fed cut interest rates. Powell and other Fed officials have stressed the Fed is pausing in its rate hiking cycle, is monitoring the economy and does not yet know which way it will move next.
*****
> Solstein Capital‚Äôs Terman said she is watching the PCE inflation report to see if it confirms her view that inflation and the economy will be weaker this summer.
*****
> She also expects the markets to be choppy, and by late summer, around its annual Jackson Hole symposium, the Fed could indicate it could cut interest rates.
*****
> ‚ÄúPeople are going to start getting even more concerned this summer about the U.S.,‚Äù Terman said.
*****
> Terman said she has been positioned for lower inflation and slower GDP growth with key holdings in utilities, REITs, Treasurys and gold.
*****
> ‚ÄúWhat would do well this summer? Staples, utilities, health care, REITs. You want fixed income. You want to be underweight tech, energy, financials and industrials,‚Äù she said.
*****
> There is also home prices data Tuesday and advanced economic indicators Thursday. That comes in addition to a few earnings reports, including Costco, Ulta Beauty and Dollar General.
*****
> Markets will also be watching the outcome of European parliamentary elections, and if there is a strong showing by populists, there could be a negative impact on the euro and risk assets.

# S&P 500 Down Four Straight Day After Memorial Day

> Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 27. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off with family and friends please take time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military.

> For decades the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market‚Äôs performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still positive. Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, over the last four years S&P 500 has declined. The second trading day after Memorial Day has since more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.

# The Bespoke Report - It's All Relative

> Hut, Hut, Cut! With weaker economic data to contend with this week on both a domestic and international basis, plus escalating tensions between the US and China, investors are increasingly pricing in a higher likelihood of rate cuts from the FOMC before the year is out. Through mid-day Friday, the Fed Fund futures market was pricing in over an 85% chance of a rate cut between now and the January 2020 meeting. Those are the kind of odds that would make James Holzhauer say ""All in.""

# Fed Members Side With ‚ÄúTransitory‚Äù Inflation

> Investors just got more details on Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers‚Äô views of inflation.

> Minutes of the Fed‚Äôs most recent meeting, which ended May 1, showed that ‚Äúmany participants‚Äù considered slowing consumer inflation as ‚Äútransitory,‚Äù and agreed that the Fed‚Äôs current patient approach should help stoke economic growth and inflation. Policymakers‚Äô optimistic view on inflation runs counter to a growing opinion in financial markets that slowing growth in core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) could warrant lower rates.

> Markets think the grace period for a ‚Äútransitory‚Äù excuse has passed, but data show it‚Äôs too soon to tell. Another measure of inflation, the Fed Bank of Dallas‚Äôs ‚Äútrimmed mean‚Äù PCE measure, points to higher pricing pressures ahead. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the trimmed mean PCE, which has proven to be a less volatile version of core PCE, has hit 2% year-over-year growth for the past several months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Slowing-Core-PCE-Due-Transitory-Factors.png?ssl=1))**

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tough to make a case for lower rates with over 3% gross domestic product growth, healthy wage growth, and a labor market close to full employment,‚Äù said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. ‚ÄúIf consumer inflation picks up, the U.S. economy will be near full employment with healthy inflation across the board, fulfilling the Fed‚Äôs dual mandate.‚Äù

> Of course, much has happened on the global front since the Fed‚Äôs last meeting. Trade tensions have flared up again, with the United States raising tariff rates on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatening to increase rates on the remaining swath of goods. Logically, tariffs should be a catalyst for higher consumer inflation, as higher costs should boost price growth. However, the opposite has happened over the past few months, and there are several factors to consider when thinking about future inflation.

> Overall, we don‚Äôt see a strong argument for a rate cut right now, and we side with the Fed in thinking consumer inflation could pick up as wage growth accelerates and growth stabilizes. At the very least, it‚Äôs becoming more obvious the Fed doesn‚Äôt have enough clarity to move policy in either direction.

*****

# Another Reason For Bulls To Smile

> The S&P 500 Index has officially gained each of the first four months of the year for the first time since 2013. This comes on the heels of the best first quarter since 1998. Six straight months in green has been the best monthly win streak to start a year, and that last happened in 1996.

> Starting a year with strength like this historically has been a good sign, even though stocks in May saw a nearly 5% correction.

> ‚ÄúAlthough we wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see continued volatility over the coming months, the good news is a great start to a year has had a funny way of eventually resolving higher,‚Äù explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúIn fact, the rest of the year has been higher an incredible 14 out of 15 times after the first four months were in the green!‚Äù

> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 returns the rest of the year (final 8 months) have been more than twice as strong as the average year returns‚Äî10% versus 4.7%‚Äîfollowing four straight monthly gains to kick off a new year. There‚Äôs always a catch though, and in this case we‚Äôve seen an average pullback of more than 8% the rest of the year.

# Earnings Season Takeaways

> We consider earnings season a success based on the amount of upside to prior estimates generated by S&P 500 Index companies despite several headwinds. Companies handily beat expectations to get first quarter earnings up to flat, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Looks-like-we%E2%80%99ll-avert-an-Earnings-recession.png?ssl=1))**

> When earnings season began in mid-April, consensus estimates called for a 4‚Äì5% drop in S&P 500 earnings, according to FactSet data. Beating results by this much is impressive considering persistent trade uncertainty and the drag on overseas profits from a strong U.S. dollar. Also consider that the median stock in the S&P 500 has grown earnings several percentage points faster because a few large companies are dragging down the market-cap-weighted calculation.

> Resilient estimates are also encouraging. Since April 15, the 2019 consensus estimate for S&P 500 earnings per share has risen slightly to $168 (a 4% year-over-year increase). We consider that a win given that estimates typically fall during earnings season.

> ‚ÄúEscalating trade uncertainty and the threat of more tariffs are huge wild cards for corporate profits,‚Äù said LPL Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. ‚ÄúWe are hopeful that significant progress can be made on the trade front next month, when President Trump and China‚Äôs President Xi are expected to meet at the G20 summit. A prolonged impasse that lasts through the summer would make mid-single-digit earnings growth difficult to achieve in 2019.‚Äù

> Our base case remains that we will get a trade deal with China early this summer and consensus expectations for 3‚Äì4% earnings growth may prove to be conservative. Earnings are hardly booming, but with a continued economic expansion, low inflation, and low interest rates, we see enough earnings growth ahead to push stocks up to our year-end S&P 500 fair value target of 3,000‚Äîthough it probably won‚Äôt get there in a straight line.

# Pre-election Year June: Tech and Small-caps Best

> June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 48 years as a rule ranking eighth with a 0.6% average gain, up 26 of 48 years. This contributes to NASDAQ‚Äôs ‚ÄúBest Eight Months‚Äù which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.3%. S&P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking tenth, but essentially flat (‚Äì0.02% average). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.6% in the month since 1979.

> In pre-election years since 1950, June ranks no better than mid-pack. June is the #8 DJIA month in pre-election years averaging a 0.8% gain with a record of nine advances in seventeen years. For S&P 500, June is #5 with an average gain of 1.2% (10-7 record). Pre-election year June ranks #6 for NASDAQ and #7 for Russell 2000 with average gains of 1.9% and 1.1% respectively. Recent pre-election year Junes in 2015, 2011 and 2007 were troublesome for the market as DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ all declined (Russell 2000 eked out a modest gain in 2015).

Nio Previews New Sedan Model - $NIO Discussion & Poor Man's DD,0.88,"[https://www.topgear.com/car-news/shanghai-motor-show/nios-tesla-and-polestar-rival](https://www.topgear.com/car-news/shanghai-motor-show/nios-tesla-and-polestar-rival)

&#x200B;

A lot of people think the introduction of the new model is going to create some ""buy the news"" hype. I'm all for it, I'm long on Nio (LEAPS and shares), but fundamentally they need to create massive demand for their models and I'm not sure if introducing a new model will create that demand, but it should definitely help. Tesla has shown that demand is really all you need to go from $17 to $270 in the EV industry (despite their shit financials, Musk God's antics, failure to execute seamlessly on Gigafactories, etc.).

&#x200B;

Poor Man's DD (off the top of my head): all #'s in USD

\- Chinese EV industry is set to blow up as the Chinese gov't is essentially mandating EVs due to pollution, helping with subsidies, tax benefits, making it illegal ride share drivers to drive regular ICE (gas) cars, $10K for a license to drive an ICE car and only a select few chosen through lottery can drive one

\- China has pulled 800 million residents (800 million!) out of poverty in the past 20 years creating a whole new middle class (and upper class) with money who are willing to spend that money

\- Nio is a first mover and has the backing of Tencent, the giant global conglomerate (they own large part of Fortnite and bunch of other games and media/entertainment outlets, and companies); Nio has a niche customer base: they also are the only EV within the the \~$60K price point, most EVs in china are very small and under $30K. Due to tariffs Teslas are $100K+, although their costs will decrease once their gigafactory in Shanghai opens

\- Despite burning through cash, Nio is sitting on a boatload of cash (\~$1B) and their working capital is huge positive; they will be able to pay off their ST debt and fund the next few Q's of operations without diving into debt

\- Nio has an app where only 1 in 20 people actually own a Nio car signifying popularity and demand for those who do not own one. Nio also has clubhouses around China at ""Nio Houses"" where Nio car owners can hang out which is pretty cool. They are trying to create a lifestyle, similar to Nike and Apple

\- William Li, the CEO was the founder of BitAuto, an online car marketplace, which is also a billion dollar company, so this is not his first rodeo

\- Nio has over 10,000 employees. They also have branches in Silicon Valley/Cali for engineering and R&D to further develop their product. They currently only sell EVs in China though

\- As much as people may want to push Nio as a ""Chinese Meme Stock"", they have incredible resources, reach, fanbase, and reasonable demand. People may want to dismiss all chinese stocks as memes, but when you look at a company like Alibaba that literally pulls in $30B in one day ( [https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/11/alibaba-singles-day-2018-record-sales-on-largest-shopping-event-day.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/11/alibaba-singles-day-2018-record-sales-on-largest-shopping-event-day.html) ), you can't ignore the results

\- As far as I can tell from videos both Chinese and US sources on Youtube and Youku, the car itself is actually a solid product, the tech of the car is great (i.e. interface and AI personal assistant), the battery tech could use some work (i.e. weird battery swapping)

\- Nio and Tesla can coexist (despite Nio being called the Tesla Killer), they have different customer bases in China where a Tesla EV is essentially double the price of a NIO EV

\- They have matched/exceeded all their delivery estimates and should continue to improve on production and delivery numbers

\- They received a major setback when they announced that they would postpone moving into their own factory and continue to pay JAC (a third party) to continue to manufacture their cars for the foreseeable future

&#x200B;

Despite all this, I think the Nio car in itself is kinda ugly, especially the front headlights, which is my biggest worry",2019-04-16 12:51:40

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 4th, 2019.

# **The week ahead: Jobs report needs to silence rising worries about the economy  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/01/the-week-ahead-jobs-report-needs-to-silence-rising-worries-about-the-economy.html)**
*****
> Job growth has remained vibrant despite the slow-growing economy,and that's a trend investors are anxious to see confirmed in the February employment report on Friday.
*****
> Even with some economists expecting growth around 1 percent for the first quarter, the labor market has been strong, and economists expect to see 185,000 jobs added in February. The economy is widely expected to bounce back in the second quarter to a pace well above 2 percent, after the temporary headwinds from the government shutdown and polar vortex abate.
*****
> The jobs data tops the list of important economic news in the week ahead, particularly after a string of disappointing reports showing that both consumers and businesses have pulled back.
*****
> The stock market will pass a major milestone on Wednesday‚Äîthe tenth anniversary of the day the market bottomed in 2009, when the S&P 500 hit 666. The S&P has gained more than 312 percent since that low of the financial crisis, and some analysts see the bull market continuing for at least another year.
*****
> ""We think there's further upside for this bull market to go. The age of the bull does not matter. What really matters is how healthy it is,"" said Patrick Palfrey, U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. ""Whatever the concerns, around trade tariffs, or decelerating corporate profits, we believe this bull market remains very healthy.""
*****
> The S&P 500 is taking aim at the 2,800 level, an important milestone that it has struggled to surpass in the past week. The 2,800 marker was an important level for the stock market four times in past several months, and holding above it could signal the rally could drive stocks to fresh highs.
*****
> Palfrey said investors first and foremost are looking at any information that can help them gauge how the economy is doing. ""We're looking for confirmation in the jobs report. We think the economy is doing okay. Labor participation is improving. We're going to see that continuing to inch back up,"" he said.
*****
> The Citigroup economic surprise index fell to a new 18-month low Friday, following a recent rash of disappointing reports. When economic reports come in below economists' expectations, the surprise index falls and a low number for the index is reflecting the economic slowdown.

> Goldman Sachs economists Friday said they were expecting first quarter growth of just 0.9 percent, but they raised second quarter growth to 2.9 percent.
*****
> #New home sales
> In addition to the jobs report, there is the Fed's beige book on the economy Wednesday and new home sales Tuesday. But after delayed and weaker data, it's the jobs report that matters most. The employment report is one data point that has been released as normal through the shutdown, and in the January data, there was a huge upside surprise of 304,000 nonfarm payrolls.
*****
> ""All eyes are on the job market. If businesses lose faith and they stop hiring, and job growth starts slowing, then we do have problems,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. Economists expect wages to rise by 0.3 percent and unemployment to fall a tenth to 3.9 percent, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> ""I think companies should stay steadfast in their hiring,"" Zandi said. He expects job growth of about 200,000 but notes there could be a payback for the huge amount of hires in January.
*****
> ""I think the economy is fragile, growth is below trend. It's very vulnerable. The only thing that will keep it together is if businesses keep hiring and the job market holds up, and I think it will unless the president doesn't settle with the Chinese on trade, or there's a hard Brexit or some other geopolitical event,"" said Zandi.
*****
> The Federal Reserve has paused in its interest rate hiking because of the slowing economy and concerns about financial conditions. But the Fed could move forward on rates again, if inflation begins to pick up, and for that reason the wage data in the jobs report would also be key were it to show new wage pressures.
*****
> There are a few speeches by Fed officials, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell who speaks at Stanford University Friday night at an economic conference.
*****
> Market focus will also be on the European Central Bank which meets Thursday.
*****
> ""I think people are expecting some detail about a long-term loan operation,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. The ECB is expected to allow European banks to extend the duration of some short-term loans. Chandler said the ECB could also push back on its time frame on raising interest rates, which it has said would not be until after the summer.

# Typical March Trading: Mid-Month Surge and Flat

> Over the recent 21 years March has been a solid performing month for the market. Average gains over the period range from a low of 1.29% by NASDAQ to a respectable 2.0% by Russell 2000. March has also been the #1 performing month by average performance for S&P 500 and Russell 2000 over the last 21 years. First trading day of March gains typically kick of the month, followed by choppy to slightly higher trading until around the tenth or eleventh trading day when the market tends to surge higher until around the fifteenth trading day. At this point the market tends to cool and can succumb to some end-of-quarter selling pressure.

# Bad Q4 Not A Bad Sign

> Now that the 4th quarter market debacle is behind us and solid gains have been logged in 2019 year-to-date we have taken a deeper dive into market action following Q4 losses for the three main U.S. market indices. DJIA and S&P 500 have been solid over the next for the next four quarters and the next year when Q1 is positive, but also good following all but three subsequent Q1 losses. On average up about 80% of the time for the full year with average gains around 8%. NASDAQ‚Äôs record is choppier.

I'll list the stocks I've bought/own below, but I need help filling in some of the letters.  I like dividend paying stocks, but I'm open to all suggestions.

#**DISCUSS!**

What is on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/wallstreetbets?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Tuesday, February 19th, 2019! :)**",2019-02-19 13:41:42
Nio,0.86,"I want to believe that $Nio is the one! I was so ready to jump on the nio fan club. I decided that since the market was closed and I couldn't go all In i would do some research.  Hopefully you guys will all tell me I'm completely wrong about them.  Then I'll know for sure I'm completely right and I will just watch from the sidelines and say hey look I was right. Anyway let me start.

Bull cases: Nio is touted as the Tesla of China. Only better China is undergoing a ev shift.  Videos of the Nio factory look so damn sweet and they are promising well get nio sold in the US by 2020. If you go to their wikipedia page it appears that they are legit https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIO_(car_company)
Setting all kinda of records with their sweet as sports car . They have a fb group and some iPhone app grp thing i didn't look into yet. Stock twits is super excited about the er upcoming. Tesla said on tv interview they are losing their competitive advantage with their batteries technology.  Tesla is too open with there IP and nio is china  and would just steal IP anyway.  Blah blah. 

My bear case.  My reeee as was bored and wanted to see if I could trade in foreign markets so i was like oh why not trade nio in its home country.  I couldn't find anything I really wanted to also because arent china market open while we're all sleeping?  I started asking around it seems they are only traded in the US I found  this old market watch article on them 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/guid/58E5BE6A-9FDC-11E8-ABEE-9079FD1B93A6

It says that 
Unusual‚Äîand risky‚Äîcorporate structure

""Like many Chinese companies with listings outside of China, Nio is a variable-interest entity, or VIE, a structure created in the 1990s as a workaround for Chinese companies that are not allowed to have direct foreign ownership. risk with this setup is that foreign investors don‚Äôt actually own stock in the company, and local management or even the Chinese government could decide or force a split with the listed company, leaving U.S. investors high and dry.""

Anyways I was already concerned about the IPO lockup date that is over on March 15th or 18th however this could be seen as a short term bull reason cause you know china is going to pump this up before that date

So why would this great new car company (car stocks stink) based in china only trade in the u.s. market? Why is the stock twits pumps excited for an ER that's possibly going to show massive cash flow issues and no revenue? If this really is the tesla of china where is the self driving car technology? Why was I changed an ADR fee with my webul account that was about .75 cents per share?

Ok make fun of me now thanks.

Edit cleared up my main concern ",2019-02-18 18:28:01

BEIJING -- China for years has tried to establish itself as an auto manufacturing powerhouse, but its vision of creating a major global brand to compete with Japanese, U.S. and European automakers has failed to materialize. Now, the government wants to change that.
With the technology shift moving from conventional vehicles to electric cars --¬†China is the world's largest market for electric vehicles¬†-- the government in Beijing believes the country can launch its own homegrown brand that can compete internationally with Tesla and other well-known makers of electric cars.
Chinese electric car startup NIO is hoping to lead the way. ""We will advance to a foreign market by 2020, probably Europe,"" William Li, the founder and chairman of Shanghai-based NIO, told the Nikkei Asian Review during the Beijing International Automotive Exhibition, known as Auto China, which wrapped up earlier this month.

The startup has attracted attention from enthusiastic motor fans in Europe. Its EP9 sports car set a speed record last year at the Nurburgring race course in Germany, a mecca for motorsports. ""Our EP9 is the fastest [electric vehicle] in the world,"" Li said.
NIO is one of several ambitious Chinese electric-vehicle startups, dubbed the ""four dragons,"" and all are competing to establish their presence in China and abroad. The others include Xiaopeng Motors, also known as Xpeng;¬†Weltmeister Motor, known as WM Motor; and Future Mobility Corporation, known by the brand Byton. The companies have all been founded within the past four years, and they have attracted investments from some of China's biggest names in tech, including¬†Alibaba Group Holding,¬†Tencent Holdings¬†and¬†Baidu. They also have received support from local governments.

The common thread of the four dragons is their aggressiveness in incorporating elements from foreign entities. For instance, NIO has research and design centers in San Jose, California, and Munich, Germany, in addition to its home base in Shanghai.
Li founded NIO, previously known as NextEV, in 2014, and the company has attracted some A-list investors, including internet conglomerate Tencent, online retailer¬†JD.comand others. It also entered into a deal late last year with Taiwanese contract electronics manufacturer Wistron, a key iPhone assembler,¬†to invest in auto-related technologies.
Still, Li is not satisfied.
""The speed at which we are developing is not very fast, and we want to expand our business to foreign markets,"" Li said. Growing and strengthening its brand in the European market can help NIO gain customers in China.
The founders of Nanjing-based Byton are themselves foreigners, from Germany. Carsten Breitfeld, the company's CEO and co-founder, is an engineer who spent 20 years at BMW, including more than 10 years as BMW Group vice president. Byton's president and co-founder, Daniel Kirchert, is very familiar with the Chinese auto market having previously served as managing director of Infiniti China and president of Dongfeng Infiniti Motor.
""We are premium brands with German technology to make cars smart,"" Breitfeld told Nikkei, noting that Byton focuses on user experience -- with various functions controlled by gestures or voice commands.
Byton's team has been gathered from other auto companies, including Ford, Volkswagen and Tesla, and it also includes a designer who led system engineering teams in designing the iMac at Apple. ""We are a very international company founded in China,"" Breitfeld said.

Is everyone that's stoked on $NIO new to the sub or have we all forgotten about $IQ and $SOGO,0.93,"$IQ and $SOGO were a wild fun ride..we all made some tendies..celebrated..gassed up the yacht...kept buying more calls..it was a great time in 2018..but we got cucked..hard ..by the goddamned Chinamen

All this hype around $NIO gives me war flashbacks..""we've learned our lesson"" .. ""I'm just gonna ride the pump and then bail"" ... ""I'm not an autist""... 

We're degenerate gamblers and if you're buying $NIO.. you're either A) new here B) Retarded C) a lucky ass mother fucker making tendies on your wild wild east gamble

That said..if $AMZN pops in the morning, I'll follow your tards back to the front line",2018-09-14 04:59:58

NIO most exciting stock (90%+ gains in 1 day),0.72,"https://preview.redd.it/7jjnkiqbp3m11.jpg?width=619&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f63a9b23f589a710d66ee1a4ec9f8b8707b9508d

NIO is basically the chinese answer to Tesla. The company itself is very ambitious and has a strong line up of electric vehicles coming and plans for a smart/electric home. The company launched on the NYSE on 9/12/18 @ around $6.64 and on 9/13/18 it saw a huge upswing in growth by around +75% during market hours and +15% in after hours for a new price of $13.50 in only a single day! The stock appears to not show any signs of slowing down any time soon. NIO's website is [http://nio.io/](http://nio.io/) if you're curious to learn more about the company. It appears they claim to have the worlds fastest car :) Anyways, if you would like to make solid gains in the upcoming future invest in NIO.

Tencent,0.5,"Does anyome have useful information/experience with Tencent? They have their investments in many (big) start-ups like NIO, the supposedly chinese tesla killer by 2020. I hate the intransparency of chinese stocks but think about buying some 6-12 month calls. Anybody already holding some or thinking about it? ",2018-07-17 15:16:25
"Bullish on Video Games / eSports? Tencent owns Riot Games, 84% of Supercell and 25 % of Activision Blizzard.",0.9,"Bullish on electric cars / automated driving? Tencent owns 5% of Tesla and a $1.6 billion stake in the Chinese up-start, NIO. 

Bullish on e-Commerce / ePayment solutions / in-app payment? Tencent owns 20% of JD.com and a stake in Vipshop. They, of course, operate WeChat, QQZone and QQ - combined these have MAU of 980 million. Within each of these, they have finance solutions, the biggest being WeChat Pay - part of which is contributing to the 143% Year on Year revenue growth for their other business department (featuring their payment business and Cloud business). 

Did you say you like The Cloud? Don't tell me that you like AI technology, too? 

Tencent owns two AI startup labs. They also run Tencent Cloud - a cloud services provider that has access to the best advertisement machine in China: Tencent's (aforementioned) social media portfolio. 


Now, I know what you're thinking right now:

""Who is this guy, u/snight, with all of these circumstantial and qualitative comments? This isn't fundamental analysis; this is bullshit!"" 
 
Well, to those of you who like to invest on more than just trends, let me posit this: 

Apart from their massive moat, a wealth of investments and insane social media portfolio. (Oh, they also have 43 million subscribers to Tencent video and a growing investment into revenue based literature and music platforms). They also achieved 61% YoY quarterly revenue growth and 45% net profit growth. They have a P/E of only 60, and a forward P/E of 40. They also have USD 13 billion in cash. Ma Huateng - or, as I like to call him, the one true Ma - has silently, steadily and overwhelmingly built up an empire of investments upon layers upon layers of IP with access to one of the biggest user base in the world. 

My last comment is food for thought, and to me, it summarises the entire philosophy of Tencent. You may know that WeChat is a social media platform, I haven't fully fleshed out how you can walk into a store, and (through WeChat) the automated payment technology can [register](http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2130062/tencent-beats-amazon-launch-unmanned-shop-lags-other-chinese-tech) what you pick up and charge it straight to your phone without you needing to talk to anyone or scan anything. What I haven't yet mentioned is Tencent's apps within apps. Tencent offers an in-app ""app store"", and they now offer [more apps or ""mini-apps"" than Apple's AppStore.](http://www.scmp.com/business/article/2129987/tencent-takes-aim-apple-and-google-app-stores-wechat-mini-program-push).
