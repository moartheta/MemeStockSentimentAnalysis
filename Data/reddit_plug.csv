"Part of what happened with GME yesterday, some things to consider moving forward.",0.97,"Long time first time yada yada yada... tldr at bottom

So did you see what all those stupid articles on whatever ad-infested websites were saying yesterday?? “GameStop soars another 50% from EPIC short squeeze, up 69% (nice) at time of halt.” You see this and think omg it’s actually happening. Wrong. Anyone with half a brain that doesn’t use the word retard while writing an article can work for those asinine media companies. So while a couple of us are partly qualified for those jobs and are able to fit the rectangle block in the rectangle hole, our pristine vernacular of the English language may have us shown the door (maybe the same one our friend at the helm of Citron is on his way through). Now even a former Boglehead like me should be able to figure out that the short squeeze has not been mcsquozen. Quick quote before we get into things...

I think it was Denzel Washington who once said “If you don’t read the newspaper, you’re uninformed. But if you do read the newspaper, you’re misinformed.” Definitely something to think about in this day and age. 

Anyway moving on. As probably many people at this point have already said, what happened on Friday was a gamma squeeze. This comes from MM’s having to hedge from all of us degenerates buying options. They however work a little differently than us when it comes to limiting their exposure. Us morons have to have 100 shares of a stock to be able to sell a covered call against it. If we had less than 100 shares, we may as well be as naked as the GameStop shorts. There’s this little guy called delta (frankly if you don’t know the Greeks it may be wise to take a quick break from options and learn those little buggers) that MM’s use as their indicator of how many shares they need to limit their exposure. Delta is a number between 0 and 1. Say you buy an option and the delta is .41, MM’s have to buy 41 shares to limit their downward exposure. But as the share price moves closer to the strike price, delta will increase and thus the MM’s will have to buy a few more shares (and vice versa with price moving down). So with the sheer amount of those otm options purchased yesterday (looking at you 55-60 calls), MM’s had to hedge accordingly, but as more people bought those calls as the price became closer and closer to the strike, it created a fun feedback loop where the MM’s were then forced purchase those additional shares as delta increased. So then after the halts, call buyers near and far took their profits which caused the MM’s to unwind their exposure bringing the stock price back down. If you bought $3,000 worth of 60c 0DTE and sold at the right time, you would’ve made a cool million+ (I know right what the fuck?!?!). So could this happen again next Friday? If a lot people expect a gamma squeeze like this to happen and buy a shitload of way otm calls, then it could be a self-fulfilling prophecy and there will be many new millionaires made next Friday. I personally have some PLTR calls I’ll be selling next week after demo day to try and fuck around with some 0DTE’s and most likely get burned lol. But don’t you ever listen to someone who says they know exactly where a stock price is going in the future and always do your own DD. 

Anyone else find it very odd that the highest strike price call option was only $60, AND THAT IT FINISHED ITM???? Either way calls with new strikes have been written (anyone see those 1/29 115’s lmao). 

So moving forward into next week, don’t be scared or discouraged if we have some relatively flatter days, we’ve been 💎 🖐 this far. Personally I would sort of like to see GME consolidate a little bit in the beginning part of the week (this is healthy for a stock - increasing exponential growth of +50% every day, while it looks just dandy on your account, cannot be kept up at any longer term rate). Also, as of today GME has 8 more days for their fourth quarter earnings. You know what this means? Buy PowerUp rewards, buy a console for your wife’s bf (preferably a bundle), buy used games (maximize profit margin), or fuck even buy Thor’s battle axe and use it as a butt plug for all I care (we know after the past two weeks that’s about the only thing that will fucking fit). An unexpected revenue and earnings beat, as well as profitability, may absolutely send this thing to the stratosphere. Why is nobody talking about Reggie as well as our three wise men from RC Ventures??? 

As a side note there’s also a lot of new blood entering from this publicity. Be nice to them -we were all beginners at one time so answer their questions, as basic as they may seem. Also be careful about what DD’s you may read, they could be using this platform for their own malicious benefit rather than the good of the group. 

TL;DR - gamma squeeze made some people rich as fuck, may happen again next Friday but it also may not. Don’t be scared of consolidation next week. Buy some shit from GameStop in the next eight days. Squeeze has not been squozed. 

And finally, thank the O.G. GME gang for the hundreds, probably even thousands of hours they collectively put in to help us all.

Be patient, be well.

"GOEV DD - Real DD, Real Rockets 🚀🚀🚀 [Long]",0.92,"So listen up you degenerates, I’m presenting to you, a fresh tight little stonk that is just waiting to be finger blasted by all of you great folks. 🖖 That’s right folks, two in the pink, TWO in the stink... 

Here’s what we know. 

Canoo - $GOEV has a deal with Hyundai to provide them with their B2B skateboard platform for their new electric cars. This is great and all, but let’s be honest, we’re not moving away from GME for a fucking Hyundai here. All you fuckers have Lambos and Tesla’s already, no time for that shit. 

So here we are back in the glory days of February 2020. TSLA, SPCE, PLUG, and Lumber Liquidators were rocketing 🚀🚀🚀 off to the moon 🌖. No wearing a fucking mask all day, we could drink with our friends, pass a blunt, and snort cocaine off hookers asses without first having to douse them in sanitizer. Ah the good ol days... anyways back to this gem of a deal that has brought us to where we are today. 

Hyundai and Canoo collaborate and agree to use Canoo’s skateboard platform for their upcoming EVs. See article below;

[Hyundai News Release](https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/2982)

Also check out the skateboard (slick marketing, very inline with a fruit named company 🍎)

[Slick as fuck Skateboard video](https://youtu.be/3ucsFNUTqtM)

Now I know your pants are starting to get a little tight or damp, and that’s ok, but stay with me here. 

Hyundai acquired Kia back in the 90’s, as a whole they sell about 7 million or so cars a year. They have set a goal of 25% of their cars sold to be electric by 2025 (not that far away). 

For those who can somehow read, but aren’t so good with this things that aren’t letters but are used in math. Let’s do some for you. 

7,000,000 cars x 25% = 1,750,000 that’s like, over a million for the folks above. Now I’m sure you’re wondering where the fuck are my rockets??? 🚀🚀🚀 There have a couple to keep you going through the next bit. 

Let’s move ahead to current day, world’s a fucking mess 😷, but Shittron is eating some of that 💩 for breakfast because they’re broke as fuck after trying to short GME. 🌈🐻s have all realized Stonks only go 📈, and they’re looking for a way to rebuild their kids education fund after blowing it all on puts. Apple has decided they want some of that dirty Tesla action, and head out looking for a way to get into the electric car business. Not knowing how the fuck you actually make a car, they go out looking for someone who does since they hope to be selling 400,000 cars by 2025ish. Here comes Hyundai, yeah they used to make shitboxes that no one other than Shittron employees and 🌈🐻s would drive, but now they’re stepping up their game. They’ve partnered with this up and coming company, who are doing some pretty cool shit - Canoo. 

So hypothetically Apple has been rumoured to be working with Hyundai/Kia for their new car, who had partnered with Canoo to use their skateboard as a base. So here we are with this little stonk with a market cap of somewhere around $4 Billion and a $17 share price. 

[Article about Apple working with Hyundai/Kia](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/apple-car-kia-hyundai-work/)

Skip this if you don’t want numbers, but I think you’re going to like this part. 

Canoo is going to be making some cars, yeah cool, whatever. The real value in here though is their B2B skateboard platform for EVs. We already figured out if Hyundai is selling 1.75 Million cars, and Apple wants another 400k or so, we’re now over 2 million cars a year. I’m going to go ahead and guess that this skateboard is worth somewhere conservatively between 5,000 - 10,000 (Canoo has already said their cars will cost 33,000, so I’ve estimated but let’s call it $7,500). 

2 million cars x $7,500 = A whole lot of fucking 

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Or give or take $15,000,000,000 yup $15 Billion fucking 💵. We’ll go with a revenue multiplier of 5x because I think that’s fair. 

5 x 15,000,000,000 = $75,000,000,000 Valuation. 

Let’s remember today’s market cap is $4 Billion. 4B x 18.75 = 75B again for all you simple folks out there that’s 18 full rockets 

🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 + a semi erect dick. 

So is this Tesla, not yet, but am I in for a potential 18x ride to the moon? Fucking right I am! 

Now let’s show this little stonk some love, and make some fucking Millionaires. 

TLDR 

GOEV = 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 + a semi erect dick. 

Side Note: Don’t be the guy that has to live with telling people that you sold your Canoo stock at $25 💎🙌🏼 Let’s go to tendie town

EDIT: Thanks for the awards, but buy positions instead!

For all clarity my position in this is small, but adding whenever I have cash available. 

Bought at $17.33 and $17.05 still waiting on approval for options trading but I think the calls are looking tasty as fuck around $20-$25 1-2 months out. Maybe a bad call to post this before I could buy more, but this one’s for all of us to make some money on.",2021-01-22 14:03:46
"The ultimate meme stock, $WOOF! WSB Idiot DD",0.8,"$WOOF!

It's more than just a funny ticker name, it's a lifestyle. From the time I was a young boy, I knew that dogs would one day rule the world. The four-legged barking fuckers stole the hearts of humans and just ripped them right out, especially when they did something cute.

And then last week, something amazing happened. PETCO went public again, under the ticker name $WOOF.

**Why the fuck should you listen to me?**

I'm the clown that's been calling all of the non-GME (and GME things) things that have been making money in the discord these past few weeks. I'm the guy that brought you:

* PLUG
* FCEL
* ICLN
* BNGO
* TLRY, APHA, and other weed stocks
* Other shit

**What's so great about this company?**

First and foremost, obviously, the ticker. But beyond that, the company itself has undergone an incredible transformation, moving from a brick-and-mortar retail store to offering pet health and pet care services (not just retail ones, higher quality ones), and moving into more advanced pet care, such as theraputics.

A few points:

* PETCO's annual revenue in 2019 was $4.43B
* Their market cap isn't even 2x revenue, at $7.9B - spelling out that this stock is MASSIVELY undervalued
* Their top competitor, CHEWY, had revenue of $3.5B, but a market cap of $40B - more than 10x its revenue.
* PETCO, a traditional brick and mortar business, has massively grown it's e-commerce platform. As an example of this, in October of 2020, it had almost 20 million website visits, compared to about 20% of that in October of 2019.
* This company has existed since 1965, and while other similar businesses have faltered, they have stayed open.
* Pet ownership has increased more than 21% during COVID (thanks u/fallenangel51294), and young people spend more on their pets.

**What the fuck do I have invested?**

A group of us on the WSB Discord have nearly 20,000 shares combined, plus options. Best list I can come up with, below:

* 2,500 shares at $26.50 average
* 11,000 shares at $27.50 average
* 5,000 shares at $29.50 average
* We've also seen a few users buying 2/19 and 3/19 30c.

**What else is there to know?**

This is an IPO, almost 90% of which have been highly successful in recent years, including $WOOF's primary competitors.

**Target Price?**

Some analysts are suggesting this is worth $70, others $100. If I had to guess, this stock could reach $30ish-$35 EOM, and go even further in Feb/Mar.

*Obviously, I'm just another idiot on the internet. Do your own DD if you want, but I'm heavily into WOOF.*

Alright Ryan Cohen,0.65,"Listen Up, Daddy. You made us a shitload of tendies, and we are forever grateful. Since SadJim already acknowledged some of us aren’t nearly as autistic as most of us are retarded, I wanted to submit a strategy play that could give $GME more fuel for 🚀 🚀 🚀 

See, most of us retards, especially the other autists over in r/gaming don’t just spend our tendies on condoms for our wives boyfriends — some of us are stupid enough to dump our tendies into dumb bullshit called *in-game transactions*. Typically, these transactions are in the pursuit of digital assets, like different colored 🌈 🐻 jumpers for your retarded characters to wear in the game. In case you autists missed it (I’m sure Daddy Cohen didn’t), I just said digital **assets**. 

Now, a smart man would take a look at this and say: “so fucking what? Who gives a shit about fake digital shit that doesn’t even exist. We like terminals with lots of big numbers, charts that go up, and green”. I’m not going to belabor the irony here.

The fact is we’re not smart men. We’re autists. And when autists see pent up value as a secondary market in gaming accounts, we see fucking tendies.

Of course Daddy Cohen has put two and two together, but I know you retards need a helping hand so here we go. Essentially, along with its increased emphasis on online game sales, $GME could also create a marketplace for gaming accounts whereby customers sell accounts for various games using valuations derived from tools $GME develops on its platform. Some tool/plug-in scans your accounts, determines the current value of your shit, and you can sell it to retards who are too lazy to amass their own dumb digital shit on their own time.

“You stupid fucking retard”, you may be saying. Yes, I know, I know. The gaming companies whom publish the games are technically the owners of those assets! Not the people who actually *paid for them*!

Well listen here motherfuckers. Daddy Cohen just bent Melvin over and fisted him after an aggressive spanking — you think he’s not ready to spend half of those tendies on a rabid team of lawyers to do the same thing to EA or Activision?

[Screenshot from statement above](https://imgur.com/s5reJyf)

If you search for ""Carbon Capture"" in the statement (and if you retards could read) you will see how they are actually contributing to the effort and plan on focusing on this market as one of their niches within green energy as a whole. With Daddy Elon tweeting this could this be a sign of an upcoming rise in the value of $ENG?

Also adding this just for valuation and true potential, we see how they are trading at a lower multiple than the bigger guys like FCEL and PLUG [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsT3YLLVoAMp781?format=jpg&name=large). This gives ENG more upside to grow 20x to match the levels of FCEL and PLUG, which would be a stock price of $140. That sounds outrageous and I'd aim for a lower target of around $20 for the short term until we really see traction and news on the company pick up.

Some Unusual Options Activity caught my eye from Friday for this week.  I typically like to scan the prior Friday on the weekend, so I figured I’d share what I was looking at in case it gives you confirmation bias or an idea. 

*REMEMBER: UOA IS AN EDUCATED GUESSING GAME WHERE YOU ARE TRYING TO STAY ABOVE 50%, AND HAVE A FEW AMAZING BAGGERS HERE AND THERE. DO NOT YOLO WHALES*

**The way I’ll break this down is by laying out my..**

**C choices:** Options activity that is intriguing, but seems like there is a strong possibility it could be a hedge, a sell the news event, isn't confirmed once I do more research, or hasn't been called out by Unusual Whales.  No precise formula. 

**B choices:** Ones I am pretty down to hop on, but need to see more.  I might be waiting for a dip, a related news event to play out, or this is one I feel could go against me big if it's an institutional hedge because of its Greeks. 

**A choices:** Shit I will likely buy right at the open, fits into what my thought process on a sector generally has been, and is simply a ticker I like.

**C choices some whales bought:**

**FSLR and SPWR: Somebody is betting solar**

**Why I like it:** Solar cooled down a little bit after the Biden-stonk frenzy to start off the week.  ICLN, EV, etc could just be refueling, and aren't necessarily done running.

**Why I don’t like it:** Falling knives, and could still be finding the bottom of it's channel.  It had a hell of a run, and hopping in now feels greedy.  The volume on these orders is also low, which can be a coinflip as to what it means.  Sometimes 600-1,000 volume is the sweet spot, but

**IV and Greeks [SPWR greeks]:** shitty theta (you’re giving back almost 20% of premium price each day on the 1/29c) and IV at or near the money is already about 100% by this point.  The only upside to straight buying a call is playing the IV/Vega on Joe Biden's inauguration speech

**News confirmation and catalyst(s):** Biden's inauguration speech could lay out a great renewable energy plan that gives the whole sector a boost.  Last week people played weed, energy and EV in hopes that his Thursday speech would touch on these things--there is a much higher likelihood his inauration speech will.  Also, [huge news about the Keystone pipeline came out this weekend ](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55709261), and I don't know if this means uppies or downies for other oil companies, since big oil is trying to appeal by saying they'll switch sources. 

**Position**: Waiting to see how Keystone decision fallout hits them tomorrow morning.  If there is a significant dip I'll probably buy it for some 1/29 SPWR calls Wednesday morning and dump with a swiftness after inauguration.

**B choices**:

[**PEP🚀🚀** underlying=141.39 **Orders**: 152.50 2/12c (IV 20.74%), 143c 1/22 (IV 16%)](https://i.imgur.com/67bZ71V.jpg)

**Unusual Whales**: No alert

**Earnings Report**: February 11th

**Why I kinda like it:** Didn't see many KO calls around, but saw the PEP calls; that contrast made the order stand out to me as more than a sector/industry bet.  The fact that the ER is one day before the 2/12 call expiration makes me like this play because I can pick up some IV along the way for what feels like a very oversold tech stalwart.  

**[IV and the Greeks:** Looks good to me, no major caution flags.  BUT, the bid/ask spread is a little wide.  This partially keeps it at C level; I’ll probably put in a low bid, forget it, and see if the price action during the day gets the order filled.

**News confirmation and catalyst(s):**On Friday Lebron James announced he’s switching his KO sponsorship to a PEP sponsorship--which probably played into this UOA.  Looking into this more, I saw that it's an energy drink play and he's now attached to Mountain Dew's Rise energy drink.  Maybe PEP gets some price upgrades since people saw how much of a beast MNST has traditionally been, maybe this starts some conversation around the sector as a whole on CNBC, or maybe neither of those things happen.  BUT, with a relatively safe stock making a big name play leading into earnings, I'm willing to lose a little theta for a week to see if anything plays out.

**Position**: A relatively safe PEP 145c 2/12 while I play the waiting game for a week or so and reevaluate.  If it's smooth sailing, likely hold for a bit into the earnings run and sell before.

**FB🚀🚀**: [Underlying= 251.36 / b: 252.50c, 257c 1/22, others (IV: 38% for 1/22, ~50% for 1/29)](https://i.imgur.com/gGXVZTA.jpg)

**Unusual Whale alert**: No

**Earnings Report**: 1/27

**Why I like it:** Welcome to earnings season for big tech, and FB is a steal right here.  They’ve been pummelled, fairly or unfairly, in the ""censorship"" aftermath and is at a great level to bounce...you can't cuck the Zuck.  I have been seeing Fb calls with their own hedges trickle in like this since Wednesday and Thursday nonstop--there was some bad What's App backlash to their new privacy policy, but if anything that will be a tastier dip for Monday entry that is to be bought. 

**IV and the greeks:** slightly elevated IV because ER is coming, but fine.  Still plenty of room for an upward trajectory on IV/Vega.  The premium for 1/29 is a tad bit pricey, so if you can't afford that I'd look at a vertical call spread capping at 255 if you're going to play it with a close expiration.

**News confirmation and catalyst(s):** What's App issue is a potential albatross for tomorrow, but I do believe this will be a relatively smooth upward earning trajectory.  Also, their Oculus 2 demand numbers are going be through the roof and has great meme potential.  I don't usually hold through ER, but I may keep a lotto for this.  Been hovering around MA200, ready to bounce bounce.

**Position:** FB 1/29 255c, FB 2/19 260c

**DVN 🚀🚀🚀**: underlying= 19.57 / **Orders**: 19.50, 20c, 21.50 1/22, many others with exp. from now to May. (IV high, around 100% on ATM weeklies) 
[DVN UOA](https://i.imgur.com/VL7iirc.jpg)

**Unusual Whales alert**: Yes

**Earnings Report:** Feb 16th

**Why I like it:** I've been seeing it pop up so much in clusters I can't ignore it any Longer. The volume has been intense in the whole sector.  [This Barron's article confirmed the activity I've been around energy.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/why-energy-could-have-a-tesla-like-2021-51610744972)  They compare it to TSLA--yes, TSLA.

**IV and the greeks**: IV is getting a bit high because of the overall energy spike, but I have confidence it's heading higher.  The bid/ask spread is problematic, though.  Will enter low and hope the order gets bought on a dip.

**News confirmation and catalyst(s):** aside from the call activity and the Barron's article pump, we have the inauguration for Biden to lay out a true vision for energy.  Early indications are that while solar, EV, etc are the hot names there is a place for truly evolving big oil companies.  They also just completed a merger on January 7th. Plus we have a nice dip tomorrow as an entry point with the Keystone news

**Positions**:  This is one that you buy LEAPS or monthlies on-- I'm looking at **2/19 121.5c and 3/19 121.5c **but I fully acknowledge that the bid/ask spread is a bitch at the moment.

**A list:**

[EDIT 🚀🚀🚀](https://i.imgur.com/hgjrLgU.jpg): underlying = 76.14 / **Order**: 1/22 85c (IV 116%) 

**Why I Like It:** Ever since I missed the NIO/PLUG everything EV launch a couple months back, I've been looking for the next industry to go off.  Energy is one of my choices, the other is whatever the fuck is going on with Gene Editing.  Genetically constructed super-babies, so hot right now. I know ARKG exists as well, I consider that a part of this play too. 

**IV and the Greeks:** Unideal for the short term, as under 100% is a general rule of thumb, but I really like this as a long term hold--so much so that I'm going to recommend the S word here (ssssssshares).

**Confirmation and catalyst(s):**  [Barron's came out with this piece over the weekend,](https://www.barrons.com/articles/with-rare-speed-gene-editing-emerges-as-biotechs-new-cutting-edge-51610655079) which is part of what I'm sure that whale was chasing. 

>While gene-editing start-ups will lose money during years of clinical trials, it’s hard to say the stocks are overvalued. If their one-time interventions can cure diseases that otherwise require chronic treatment—or lack any treatment at all—then the stocks will fly. 

**Position**: Opening up two LEAPs if I can get a dip so the 1/20/22 ask is only around 2,300.  Will chase on a 2/5 77 because the bid/ask spread on that strike is (relatively) reasonable and it feels doable. If this one is pricey for you consider call debit spreads.

**Two interesting trends from Friday UOA that I’m trying to connect some dots on:**

[1) Cruiseline puts were everywhere](https://i.imgur.com/AOuseNk.jpg)

I saw this enough that it made me think.  My hunch was that a lot of bad COVID recovery-stonk news is coming during inauguration (plus global trends).  That contrasted a little with the second interesting trend...

[2) Vaccines all got Unusual call options at various times](https://i.imgur.com/Z1AfJuF.jpg)
I saw MRNA got some UK upgrade attention today--maybe that was some of the reason, maybe that was none of the reason, but interesting nonetheless.

I checked Unusual Whales to see if they have any cruise alerts and they had the opposite of the orders I saw--a CCL 1/29 call alerted.  They also had MRNA 2/5 145 calls.  I'm going to stay away from the cruise puts, and probably go with some MRNA and NVAX 2/5 calls, slightly OTM depending where we open up.  It seems like the cruise puts were a hedge for a good week for vaccines. 

**Open Interest change notables**:

1) **Oil** saw huge OI increases for January and Feb expirations (XOM, PBR, etc).

2) **Uber** had huge OI increase for 2/19 both calls and puts.  Earning are 2/10

3) **F** and **GM** having obvious increases from their big splashes

4) **SRNE** had serious volume as well and lots of sporadic call buys

—————————-

**Other options I saw I liked:** **BZUN 2/19 45c** **FEYE** 1/22 25c I will play as a 2/5, **WKHS** 25c 2/5

**Positions:**

**PEP** 145c 2/12

**FB** 1/29 255c, FB 2/19 260c

**DVN** 2/19 21.5c and 3/19 121.5c

**EDIT**: 2/5 77c

**INO/NVAX/MRNA** take your pick (Cruise puts hedge)
**EDIT: JUST NOTICED A 170c 1/22 NVAX I MISSED**

**VXX**: 1/29 18c and 19c. bigly hedged for inauguration shenigans. 

*waiting for a dip for some of these because I’m
Nervous about Thursday.* 

**TLDR**:
Energy, Gene editing, and Vaccines were all trending on Friday UOA.  FB has been getting a lot of call activity as well ahead of earnings.  PEP looks good for a run too on the heels of Lebron James signing pre-earnings.

Unusual Options Activity 101: Whale Watching Tips,0.98,"This is long, if you’re uninterested skip to the ten tips list or TLDR

A while ago I started mixing unusual options activity into my ~~gambling~~investing.  At first I lost a shitload of money chasing dumbass whales with zero plan, but now I actually have a pretty good feel for it.  I still fuck up alot, but more often I do not fuck up.  This is to help those of you who want to start chasing whales, or are at a basic level and want to do it better.

I'm using some plays from this week as examples because they are fresh in my mind and I have a couple screenshots.

**Tools**
I use barchart in tandem with Unusual Whales. For barchart, you can honestly get by using their free version, you just can't sort as well.  They have a free month trial too.  I also pay the 20 bucks for Unusual Whales to confirm what I scan, and they have a good stocks volume standard deviation tool.  I have zero affiliation to either, just saying what I use.

There are way more technical ways to do this, but I like to use my eyes to scan sporadically throughout the day like a boomer.

**Basic Concept**
Long story short, you're ideally chasing the options purchases of what are, presumably, deep-pocketed individuals or institutions.  UOA identifies certain options contract orders that are higher than the average daily contract order.  For example, if the average daily option volume on an GME weekly is 4,000, and an option order enters for 4,000 or higher, it's flagged as unusual activity since it's a multiple of that daily average volume--sometimes it shows as multiple orders if ""they"" push through a few smaller purchases that produce heavy volume.

MM are sneks who like to move in silence, which they can do with with stock positions via dark pools and the like.  However, they can't get away with that with options activity--it all shows.  That fact, young autist, is your slingshot against the institutional goliath.

**Hunting the Whale**
So I've got my unusual options activity page open on barchart or wherever for the current day.  I adjust the expiration date option so that the options I'm looking at don't expire past a couple weeks out (more on why later), then I'm ready to eye scan.

I typically start by looking for **one of two things: 1) large clusters of orders that belong to one ticker  or 2) sporadic orders for a ticker that consistently show up over a couple hours, but belong to non-hot, non-meme stonks that do NOT have earnings imminent.**  To make sure I'm looking at something potentially weird, I choose to exclude options that expire more than a couple weeks out.

**1) Clusters of orders—ABNB example**
The way I scope it is kind of a tiered process.  *First*, I'm looking to see if there are any clusters of orders that catch my eye on a quick scan.  *Second*, I'm looking to see if those clusters of orders contain both calls AND puts, with some OTM activity and spreads preferred.  *Third*, I look to see if the number of seperate call orders outweighs the number of put orders (or vice versa), and additionally I look to see if the volume of the calls drastically outweighs the volume of the puts (or vice versa).  

**Why?  Because it helps you determine if the options order is just a hedge, or if it’s hedging against itself as it’s own positio**n. This is super important so try to follow along-- most UOA is just institutions hedging; Mr. MM has a nice, busy life and fancy yacht and can't just exit his positions back and forth all day like a WSBer.  He also has like a billion shares of his stonks, so if he dumps it when he's got paper hands it will siginficantly tank the value and cause a ripple effect.  So, *instead* of hedging by dumping his shit, he hedges by adding OTM options against his position--next level fucking diamond hands.  That would be the type of whale order from Mr. MM we don't want to follow.  *But*, if Mr. MM buys 4,000 FB call options in a few blocks, and you see like 1,000 in FB puts go through right alongside it, the odds are that someone is betting big on FB and using the puts as a hedge, since the puts represent a smaller volume in the call/put ratio.  Instead of the options being a hedge for a bigger stock position they hold, these types of option clusters indicate that the option order itself is the big, independent play, and it's hedging itself with lower volume order vs the higher volume (4,000 calls to 1,000 puts).

**Then I do an easy confirmation**.  I check the tickers general trend the past week or so in a chart, do a news search on twitter of their ticker for news catalysts and sentiment, and google and YouTube to see if the crayola kids think it's a good nerd play.

**Example**: Here's the screenshot on some ABNB UOA I noticed and played this week.  It went to 200% and change within a couple hours, but I had unfortunate diamond hands and sold for about half that.

[ABNB UOA](https://i.imgur.com/mYDXYmN.jpg)

So, this a softball.  **First**, you can see that ABNB all of a sudden explodes with all these options showing up at 12:52–that's our cluster.  **Second**, the clusters have both calls and puts in that minute timespan, with some put orders showing at the bottom of the cluster.  Some of the calls are deep OTM, as far as 200c.  **Third**, the call orders far outweigh the put orders in both amount and volume.  *Awwwww shit, looks like we got more than a hedge—we’re onto something.*

**Confirmation time**: ABNB had been on a general uptrend, and I typically don't like to chase, but I combed twitter and saw their were rumors of the CEO speaking the following day, and that news had just broken of their DC booking cancellations.  I looked back into the morning, and saw a few more unusual blocks, and a few more rolled in just after the cluster pictured above.

Passed the smell test.  Options bought, tendies gained.

**Sparse Orders: SNAP example**

The same principles can apply to orders on tickers that pop up individual orders, not large clusters,  which **a) haven’t had much attention b) have been on a steep downtrend—this makes the order unusual, and/or c) seem to keep popping up in single orders over a few hours to a day.**The same principles as above apply, but if you see these types of orders with very little time left until expiration, you can assume assume it's probably not a hedge.  SNAP isn't the best example of the week because there wasn't a put order in this block.  But, there was positive TA sentiment when I searched, SNAP had been on an oversold downtrend, and I don't have screenshots left of the better ones I saw and went after.  **Plus, importantly, IT WAS TOWARDS THE END OF THE DAY** (this is huge, EOD is prime time for AH news whales)

[SNAP UOA](https://i.imgur.com/GGr5bra.jpg)

A better example from this week though is SPCE, which had only a few orders sprinkled throughout the day, and one toward the end of the day which was DEEP, DEEP OTM expiring 1/15.  **That’s a flag for us—sporadic listing throughout the day, OTM toward the end of the day. ** BAM! EOD SPCE OTM calls sprinkle in, ARK invests to kick off AH, SPCE moons. 

**Sparse Orders Patterns: Connecting the dots on tech rebound with FB and SNAP**

Seeing the SNAP orders above sharpened my eyes that day to looking for a pattern with tech on the whole, since big tech had been so royally gaped the past week.  I kept seeing FB options like this pop up

[https://i.imgur.com/muVGtq2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/T54peER.jpg)

Sometimes you can put together sporadic listings and create a working theory based on a sector.  Because this and similar FB orders were deep OTM and one day out, I knew there was a risk they could a hedge, but also knew that the tech sector was due for a rebound and saw SNAP posting sporadic OTM as well.  **So, I bought my options for each of those two another week out and closer to ATM (important, more below), to give the whale some breathing room** in case was it was a hedge, even though the technicals agreed with the bounce.  The whales were right, and it was an easy little overnight profit.


**How I’ve Fucked Up 1: Don’t get tricked by trends**

Although we like to believe institutions are ahead of the curve, often they are just trend-riding lemmings who follow what's already way, way up.  They buy the top, just like WSB tardies such as yourself specialize in.  So, when you see shit like this below, take a minute to think before you get excited:

[NIO UOA LIKE THIS WAS NONSTOP](https://i.imgur.com/JCZBx2s.jpg)

It was the same for all the memes: PLUG, FCEL, MARA, and RIOT all week, dominating the orders.  If something is already too popular, just stay away from it.  You can ride something up, but when you see massive orders on shit that's already like 400% IV, just...don't.

**How I’ve Fucked Up 2: DO give the MM’s some breathing room**

*Even if you’re confident in a move you see that is a few days out, extend your play a week or two further out minimum, and strike it closer to ATM.*  If you can't do either of those things because you can't afford the premium just skip that play and check back for something new later; I promise a better opportunity will arise.  You can recover from bagholding, but you cannot recover from blowing your account on an incorrect 0DTE.

Breathing room is also important because often whales will have the news but not the exact timing.  Two months ago I followed a DDOG whale on a Thursday 1DTE that expired worthless the next day.  The following Monday (1 trade day later) DDOG made the announcement that rocketed them like 20%--if I'd given them a week's breathing room, it would've been a 15 bagger.  Fucking F.

**So, to review:** look for order clusters or sporadic ticker orders that a) have a mix of calls and puts with one dominating the other b) unpopular tickers that have deep OTM or close expirations c) always check chatter afterward and fundamentals and d) try to put together a narrative of things that are related that catch your eye (this Monday's EV run or this Friday's tech bounce could be next week's airline dominance or cruiseline craze--connect the dots).  Initially look for options expiring soon, as they indicate the most riskiness--and therefore confidence--if the MM is not hedging.  Shop with a short term eye, buy with a long term choice. 

**10 Things That Will Help You Not GUH:**

**1)** Monday and Friday morning/afternoon are the most accurate whale times, according to data from Unusual Whales

**2)** If you don't have PDT always save some spending power for EOD shopping

**3**) If you don't have PDT never, ever follow a whale with a weekly.  Sometimes the news the whale bets on is a 'sell the news' event, and you won’t recover from a drop especially if there is IV crush involved. 

**4)** Always give the whale breathing room by purchasing an expiration at least a week further out

**4b**) Always give the whale breathing room by going closer to ATM strikes than theirs

**5)** Sign up for barchart monthly trial (then continue it) and unusual whales--they're each like 20 bucks and thats way less than you spend on an FD. 

**6**) You don't need to learn TA, but you need to check technicals on the tickers you want to chase--almost every major ticker has youtubers or fintwits giving their daily or weekly TA.  This way you know if it's a proper breakout happening if the whale hits, and you're not just guessing at when to take profits.  Remember, whales can buy wayyyyyyy OTM and sell for massive profit at any point--they *aren’t* bagholding a call until it's in the money like you are. You may be 10% up waiting for the next 80% GME day while your whale has sold at their target 5% profits on the play and is chillin. 

**7**) Leave at least 10% of your account spending power free each day.  I promise, the one time you go full boat you will see the most obvious whale play at the end of the day.  Then you won't be able to do shit about it and you'll hate yourself when it's a 10 bagger overnight.  Trust me.

**8**) Make sure the ticker you're chasing isn't just ER anticipation/bets.  Always check earnings dates before buying.

**9**) Remember whales are people, so they can be stupid, too.  Don't baghold a position that is clearly fucked for some news that looks unlikely to come.  They are gambling addicts just like you, except they have more money.

**10**) Always take profits if you ask yourself if it's time to.  If it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to close the position.

**Positions**:
Dumped a ton of stuff and loading up Tuesday because long weekends scare me, but saw some ineresting 2/5s I held including

WKHSc
PLTRc
SPYc (1/19, 1/22)
LMNDp

And a couple tickers that I couldn’t post lol.  also have AAPL and JD leaps

***

TLDR
Use a service to follow whales so you can get ahead of announcements.  Look for clusters of options activity that hedge themselves via call/put ratio, and do a legitimate check for TA and catalysts to confirm their moves.  Never follow a whale into a weekly, but use weeklies are your best screener.

***

*I might do a pretty consistent DD post (a couple times a week) on what I’m seeing at the end of each day if there is interest, and if it’s not a day I don’t have a ton of real work.  If something quick catches my eye I usually throw it up on my twitter @yourboymilt (there’s no notification thing on here mods, just trying to be helpful— not selling anything) I’ll also probably throw some more potential Monday positions on here over the weekend once I decide to do some more research.

"PLUG, And why the next three years are going to be humongous.",0.84," 

Alright, shut the fuck up about GME for a second and Im gonna make you money. y'all heard alot about PLUG from a few places as of late. Yes, it has exploded 135% in the last month alone but it isn't over. Right now, the sentiment is bearish and I agree in the short term, but long term PLUG is only going to keep growing. There are a few key points I want to highlight.

PLUG is single-highhandedly the largest hydrogen-fuel-cell titan in the industry. 20 years of industry under its belt, it now services Amazon with 40,000 active forklifts and Walmart uses roughly 10,000 active vehicles. Now, they are partnering with two more titans. Renault and SK Group. The French and South Korean markets respectively. First, Renault. Renault is well established in France, and is backed by the government itself. The deal with Renault is HUGE for plug in the European market. **The two plan to establish an innovation center for development of fuel cell technology in LCV vehicles** ***for*** **future Renault platforms. Initially, heavy vans and utility. They plan on combining manufacturing with Renault, establishing a vertically integrated fuel cell stack system and a manufacturing center in France. Expansion of refueling systems to accommodate the new market. The deal will only accelerate in the future as Renault plans to adopt Plug Power technology in commercial fleets.** Why is Renault Interested? Well, the EU announced a plan calling for Europe to have at least six gigawatts of renewable hydrogen electrolyzers by 2024 (A critical period for PLUG for a few more reasons) and the production of up to 1 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen. Doable, sure, but the bigger picture is this:

This is almost exactly how the rise of the solar industry happened. EU plans into the future. The European Union unveiled a plan this month to invest hundreds of billions of euros in technologies enabling it to get a substantial share of its energy from hydrogen by 2050. This is potentially **insane**.

([https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/hydrogen\_strategy.pdf](https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/hydrogen_strategy.pdf))

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Second group. SK Group is planning to invest 1.5 billion USD in an intention to form a joint venture next year. The goal is to provide South Korea (and later a possibility of the larger Asian Market) hydrogen fuel cell systems. Particularly, Infrastructure and electrolyzers (power stations, basically). There is, however, no information if PLUG is planning on directly partnering with any manufacturers in Korea. (I will get to this later). Why is SK Group interested in Plug? Plans call to build a liquid hydrogen plant with an annual capacity of 30,000 tons in Incheon in **2023**, to be scaled up to 280,000 tons in **2025**. The South Korean government's commitment to shift the to Hydrogen with 729 Million dollars this year. A 30% increase from last year.

*Now, whats the point of all this infrastructure? I understand the powerplants but is the future just going to be us driving in Amazon forklifts?* \- Says you, a dumbass who doesnt do DD and leaves it up to others in what is basically a Casino.

Sweet summer child..

Hydrogen fuel is going to be big in the automotive scene. Yes, Papa Musk hates it, so fucking what? keep buying one year out calls @ 50% OTM and tell Musk to fuck off with how much bank you're going to make.

GM may have made a statement that they are going for ALL hydrogen back in 2017, but they have since rescinded that statement. Their Hydrogen plan still remains though, Fuel-cell power-trains will be used in military and commercial vehicles. ([https://twitter.com/mikewayland/status/1283734665157922816?lang=en](https://twitter.com/mikewayland/status/1283734665157922816?lang=en))

Honda is already selling a vehicle with hydrogen fuel cell technology. The Honda Clarity. They plan on expanding on the line greatly as they seem to be extremely set on becoming green.

Hyundai is already selling a vehicle with hydrogen fuel cell technology, the Hyundai Nexo. **Hyundai Motor Group and its suppliers plan to spend of 7.6 trillion won (US$6.7 billion) through 2030 to raise production of fuel cells by more than 200-fold as the South Korean automaker targets to become a key player in the new-energy vehicle technology.**

So much money is flowing into Hydrogen fuel cell technology, why is noone capitalizing on it?

The play: Wait for volatility to die down, PLUG has had a massive run up. Truly tremendous, and I'm glad to have been in PLUG for a long while. The hype is almost certainly blown up, and general market attitude is that it is a sell which I agree with.

TLDR: PLUG is going to return from low-earth orbit to refuel, my price target is 50 by mid-FEB before PLUG does a Hindenburg and the price fucking explodes. 🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

Position:

Wait for good entry: PLUG 70C 06/18. Yes its fucking expensive, wait for better entry and learn how to do spreads, dumbass. You bet big and win big.

If you have more than 6 brain cells or are straight up fucking broke: Buy LEAPS and Shares on the dip thats about to happen. Im in for PLUG 100C 1/20/23, and will load up even more because its as high as Robinhood's shitty platform lets me go. **SPREADS, LEARN HOW TO DO THEM, STOP BEING POOR AND LOSING YOUR TSLA GAINS ON SHITTY PLAYS.**

Here's your next possible energy play,0.93,"# Feeling missed out on PLUG?

Don't worry my fellow degenerates here's your next consideration

**AES, a power generation and utility company with majority operations located in US with the rest located in South America.**

Now I'm not going to post here a shit ton of charts that none of you actually read or believe in (someone showed me that drawing a fucking FORK on a chart will tell me I'm about to make bank). Instead what I will say is that this company has slowly, *slowly* been gaining traction in terms of price & volume for the past several weeks.

# At a glance

1. 34 plants (53% solar, 36% wind and 11% energy) that all are currently operating under AES
2. 20 plants under construction (\~25% split as above but now includes hydrogen)
3. Net income YoY decreased from +598m to a loss of -249m supposedly because of regulated rates during the COVID pandemic.
4. Massive focus of dropping coal & other boomer energy
5. Turns a profit every other quarter/year.
6. 1.5 billion in cash & equivalents

# What are the risk factors?

For me I don't really fuck with making up shit and I rely on Grand-daddy Graham to guide me to make sure that I don't blow up the account and end up posting loss porn for 34 karma. So here are the risk factors that I don't like about this company:

1. Total assets only slightly exceeds total liabilities you at least want to keep a 2:1 ratio 
2. No consistency in profits
3. I'm not a fucking energy expert. My field is Retail, Supply Chain, eCommerce.

# What's my play?

This is a company that shows positive and good gains one quarter and then shows losses the next quarter. Hence it's my belief on why it hasn't gained any traction. However, lately there has been a huge emphasis by AES on transforming the company into going **full** renewable for the US.

What does this mean?

Institutions will take an interest and begin making their plays. We will be seeing investments from institutions all wanting a piece of the pie when they saw PLUG shatter all logic. As a comparison PLUG had on avg of \~100m losses every year in the previous 3 years and their valuation sky-fucking-rocketed. 

So why in the world would AES, a company that actually generates profit and has cash equivalents of 1.5b laying around not go in the same trajectory?

Even without the institutional investing they have enough talent in exec force to understand simple finances in order to begin turning consistent profits. 

2/19 25 & 27c -- sell 70-80% before expiry and exercise the rest. Volatility is relatively low for this stock and the calls are still relatively cheap.

"GME - Short interest, dip (nope), Maths, Buying, FOMO 🚀🌙🙏🏼 - We are better at being irrational than Melvin is at being solvent.",0.97,"Rocket 🚀 
Moon 🌙 
Squeeze 🙏🏼


We are so dumb, we’re right about this.  If you’ve read anything on this sub, you know we can be irrational.  


If you know anything about investing, you know the markets can be irrational longer than investors can remain solvent.  


Well guys, we’re the most irrational I’ve ever seen.  And we’re friggin good at it.  
*Ain’t no way anyone can out solvent our irrationality*


But if you don’t believe me, here’s some actually talking points:  


GME is Not dipping.  The math just isn’t there.  This is not a normal rally/hype.  It was a momentum thing.  It’s now becoming a squeeze within the next week.  


This doubling in under 48hrs has made all shorts unprofitable.  It doesn’t matter where they entered.  


Short seller’s peak profit happens if a stock goes to $0.  No one expects GME to be at $0 even in the next few years.  But assuming it could a month from now, let’s do the maths. 


Most shorts got in around $15 or less.  That means the most they can make is $15, **IF** GME goes to $0 (it won’t). 


Now any time you borrow anything, you have to pay interest on it, this includes shares.  The current interest rate is 45% (or higher).  The interest is on the price of the current shares, not the price they bought in at.  


This means on a share price of $40, they are paying nearly $0.06 a day to short it.  Doesn’t sound too expensive right? Until you realize that in less than 28 days (if they allow it compound), they will have paid more in interest than they could ever gain, even if GME went to $0 in February. 


Keep in mind, once a short seller realizes it is literally impossible to make money, they just need to time their exit.  Since this is a stampede of short sellers, the best time to exit is right away.  They literally can’t wait 3 weeks, or else they might as well quite a few more dollars a share (from the interest they’re going to accrue).  


Keep in mind, this is all voluntary covering.  There are also tons of accounts out there that will now have to cover due to margin calls and such.  


Keep in mind that 71 million shares are shorted.  That’s more than are technically available.  


Keep in mind that 20% of shares are locked up by Cohen &amp; such, who cannot sell for a few more months.  So that leaves even less shares for the shorts.  


Once most of the shorts cover (within 3 weeks), the price won’t drop overnight.  They have to buy more shares than available and anyone left holding shorts will still be buying.  And by that time, a new base &amp; support level should have been established.  


*****
Thinking of FOMOing? You should be fine with shares.  Still could see upside of 50%+ 
*****
I recommend buying shares, cause IV is crazy high and if MM somehow finds a way to eff with people, they will.  Sometimes they are smarter than me (but hey, that’s their job, I’m just an idiot). 
*****


Positions: 

104 shares @ $20.15
Sold $22 call (much regret, didn’t know squeeze would happen so soon, I’m an idiot)
Bought $38c 1/15exp 
Hope to add shares tomorrow morning &amp; maybe a call for next Friday.  But ... I have a high risk tolerance and have made a nice chunk, so if my calls go tits up, don’t care. 


*****
Shameless plug for the next huge move: 
Cash out half next week &amp; dump it in Apple calls (1/29 or 03/21) any strike, can’t go wrong.  I have $200c, $160c, $135c, 75 shares.  
*****


TL;DR: 
50% upside for GME


Shorts have to cover in less than 25 days or they literally will lose more than they could ever gain from shorting.  


45% interest payments on current share price hurts shorts.  


20% of shares are tied up &amp; not able to be sold. 


Shorters need to buy almost 200% of available shares in the next 3 weeks (assuming they want to cap their losses at 100%). 


Not too late to jump in with shares. 


Don’t wait for a dip.

"Reeeeeeeeecap of today and recent market driving news (Jan 14, 2021)",0.98,"* 76% of WSB who's still in GME collectively orgasmed yesterday as GME pushed to the stratosphere with the stock soaring as high as 90% during intraday high. Profit taking and volatile swings brought the shares down to a modest close of ""only"" up 57% at $31.40. u/DeepFuckingValue, who has titanium alloy diamond hands (now known as DFV hands) posted an update and to the surprise of no one, is still holding his 1,000 contracts of Jan 15 $20c on Wednesday afternoon. (Note: He took gains on the contracts today though I'm not sure at what point in the day while keeping his April $12c).

* The pump action resumed for GME this Thursday morning with premarket pushing the underlying back to $38 once again and commenced to another wild session of large movements. Initially trading around $34 to $36 in morning, GME started to rip once again when noon struck and ran as high as $43 for the day. GME closed the day up 27% to $40. If you're STILL not in GME, these back-to-back days have pushed IV to new highs and even OTM contracts months out will be commanding large premium (~160%+ IV for April and 140%+ for July). Proceed with caution (who am I kidding just go all in).

* Morning economic numbers: jobless claims continues its dismal trend, with first-time claims hitting 965k last week vs the consensus of 800k (oof). Last week's total was 784k. As with before, market did not react to the numbers cuz its PrIcEd iN. Import prices rose 0.9 in Dec vs 0.6 expected.

* Jpow spoke at 12:30 PM today in a Princeton Uni session and reaffirmed what everyone has largely expected: rates will continue to be low and while the Feds will raise rate eventually, Jpow says that its ""no time soon"" given economic situation.

* Are they big tech or big cuck? The market reversed course and big tech continues their sell off, with MSFT, AAPL, NFLX, and AMZN all retreating more than -1% as yet another sector rotation commenced. Payment providers got an extra dose of sell-off with V closing at -3.43% and MA closing at -5.25%, despite both having positive PT from Deutsche Bank today with V having a PT increase of $270 from $220 and MA PT increase of $420 from $383.

* Small caps performed strongly today as money flow throughout the day into ""value"" grabs. RUT/IWM closed the day up 2%. Notable underlyings beyond GME are BBBY (up 18.77%), MIK (up 9.6%), M (up 5%), WSM (up 4%), and KIRK (up 9.58%).

* In WSB meme stock land MT continues in its channel, gaining 2.95% today to close at $24.81 PLTR got hit with another downgrade, this time via Citi as the analysts believes the stock is vulnerable to a few upcoming catalyst, including lockup expiry and an deceleration in growth. PT for Citi is $15 (don't worry tho surely WSB is ""in control"" with this stock too). PLUG drilled more than -5.74% during intraday low as JPM initiated with a neutral rating and downgraded sector competitor FCEL. PLUG closed the day down -4.26% to $64.63 while FCEL closed the day down -8% to $17.60, fending off intraday low of more than -12%. ICLN, the clean tech ETF continues its range bound trading and will likely require a clear catalyst in terms of what the $2 tril stimulus actually entails to move further. Buckle up, loser.

* Despite being green most of the day, major indexes retreated to red as power hour neared. Indexes went red and lost all its morning gains as the sell-off accelerated into closing hours. DOW closed the day down -0.22% or -69 pts, IXIC closed down -0.12% or -16 pts, SPX closed -0.38% or -14 pts, and RUT closed up 2% or 43 pts. While the retreat was modest compare to yesterday's close, the intraday reversal was quite jarring esp if you're trading FDs (and let's face it, you definitely were loading up on those Jan 1/15 calls).

* Earning season will soon be upon us and the first wave are starting later this week. Tomorrow morning financials kick things off as WFC, JPM, and C are all reporting before market opens. If banks shat the bed, expect a pounding for the Dow given how large of a component they are still to the stupid index. Expectations are fairly high as JPM has had a flurry of upgrades in the past few days with PT of $150 from Piper Sandler, $152 from Jefferies, and an upgrade to buy from neutral at BofA.

* Biden will unveil his $2 tril stimulus package/plan in a speech later tonight at 7:15 PM ET. Please pump those green tech cuz I have an embarrassing amount in SPAC/EVs.

(Yesterday's recap: none cuz I was lazy and enjoying gains. You can read last Friday's recap [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ktbvv1/reeeeeeeeecap_of_recent_market_driving_news_jan_8/).)",2021-01-14 21:24:26

"Clean Energy (ICLN, TAN, BLNK, etc) DD - A Multi-Month Biden Play",0.98,"Firstly, read this article:

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/14/business/biden-economy.html

Specifically this part:
>The proposals in the second tranche are likely to be larger than the first, and Democrats plan to pay for all or some of them by raising taxes on corporations and the rich. The second package is expected to be centered on job creation and infrastructure, **including hundreds of billions of dollars of spending on clean energy projects like electric vehicle charging stations**, along with health care and education spending, Mr. Biden’s team and leading congressional Democrats have indicated.

TL;DR - Biden is going to talk about stimulus TONIGHT. In this speech he may talk up clean energy. When he gets inaugurated on the 20th, his first order of business is going to be a spending bill that will be **certain** to include clean energy spending.

My pick for this is ICLN. Why ICLN specifically? Because it contains a multitude of clean energy plays, from PLUG to ENPH to FSLR. TAN is a good choice as well but its much more lopsided, with 10% of its holdings in ENPH. ICLN is also a good choice because its still got a lot of room to run. Over the last month it has gone up 32%, from 24 to its current price of 32. A similar increases would place it at 42 or so.

A good example of how powerfully ICLN can move is when Democrats took Georgia. It moved up 14% in two days. I suspect when Biden is finally put into office we may see similar movements, especially when he voices intent to spend big money on clean energy.

This means clean energy plays like ICLN, TAN, and other specific companies not in these ETFs will moon. My suggestion to those not in these is to purchase longer dated calls. I think ICLN April 35c is a great call for this, but if you're a huge autist playing off only Biden's speech and inauguration, then ICLN February 30c might be the play for you. I actually don't suggest the ICLN February 35c (Despite me being in it) because its delta seems poor compared to other the options listed and it moves strangely right now.

Rockets for good measure 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

EDIT:
This JUST in people - Biden's Coranavirus Relief Plan

https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/biden-s-emergency-coronavirus-plan/93eaf097-0e81-4ea2-90f6-d0f4b7937b22/

>This program includes a competitive set-aside of funding for states to invest in **clean energy and energy efficiency projects** that reduce electricity bills for families in disadvantaged communities


>Leverage $35 billion in government funds into $175 billion in additional small business lending and investment. ​With a $35 billion investment in successful state, local, tribal, and non-profit small business financing programs, Congress can generate as much as $175 billion in low-interest loans and venture capital to help entrepreneurs -- **including those in the clean energy sector** --innovate, create and maintain jobs, build wealth, and provide the essential goods and services that communities depend on.


>President-elect Biden is calling on Congress to give Tribes the resources they need to obtain sufficient personal protective equipment,increase **access to clean water and electricity**, and expand internet access so that children can learn remotely and more families can obtain basic health care through telemedicine. President-elect Biden’s plan would invest $20 billion in Indian Country to support Tribal governments' response to the pandemic.​​",2021-01-14 17:27:19

Plug Power rises on Renault venture while GM reveals flying car. Is Tesla going to crush Apple? Let’s talk about this & other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market posting small gains, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/V2Yn5xJ) leading the way, up .28%, the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/hMpFmmF) gaining 60 points and the [SP500](https://ibb.co/YLYfs4V) finishing flat for the day, just about 3800, while the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sgR88nB) posted a 3% decline, though it seemed it was going to go back into higher volatility territory in the middle of the day

We also saw almost 70% of [companies](https://ibb.co/vHBQThL) advancing with 260 new highs on about average volume as 6 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/7pwD88M) finished in the green, with Energy leading the way yet again & continuing to outperform in 2021, while Health Care and Communications lost more than 1%, with Large-Cap Growth Companies being the biggest laggard, also continuing the huge underperformance compared to all other factors, as small & mid-caps have largely [outperformed](https://ibb.co/QH694Vc) since the start of the year.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/2Kt4ChR) from yesterday, with most big tech companies losing ground, though Tesla did recover after an 8% plunge on Monday and was also joined by the Banks, the Semiconductors and the Oil & Gas companies.

Yesterday we also got some economic data, with the Small Business Optimism [INDEX](https://ibb.co/12TgvbS) falling sharply to 95.9 in December, vs the 102 expected and 101.4 in the previous month, as the small business optimism has continued to drop after the highs it made in September, while job [OPENINGS](https://ibb.co/S0VG5PZ) came pretty much in line with the previous report at 6.52M, as the openings rate remained double the quits rate. And in some better news we saw the worldwide semiconductor [MARKET](https://ibb.co/8NZ79p7) gaining 7% year over year to reach $39.4B for November, as the world will keep on needing more & more semiconductors with improving technology, I really like this sector and I believe it’s one of the best for long-term investing.

[Today](https://ibb.co/s3c5sMQ) we start the day off with the MBA Mortgage Applications, Consumer Price Index and finish the day with the Treasury Budget and the FED’s Beige Book.

While in the IPO world, we will see [AFFIRM](https://ibb.co/6WqTmZX) start trading today, as the company set the final IPO price at $49 way above the first and second ranges between 33-44$. I really am interested in this company thought it’s unlikely we will see shares available to retail traders under 60-70$ in my opinion, while in the M&A department, we saw [VISA](https://ibb.co/CVkG87d) terminate the merger agreement with Plaid a year after the first announcement of the proposed transaction.

In some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/VBYhdY1), we saw Boeing land a $1.7B Air Force contract. This is good news for Boeing, as the commercial airlines business will be struggling at least for a couple of years until they ramp up the MAX production & airline traffic demand goes back close to the levels seen before 2020, which might happen with more easily scalable vaccines coming soon from the likes of [JNJ](https://ibb.co/VCpS3Kw), while they also did suffer another hit with a plane crash in Asia, though it’s not expected to be from a manufacturing defect, but [RATHER](https://ibb.co/Y2TZtNK) by the lax maintenance in the 9months the airplane was grounded last year.

We also saw Plug Power [skyrocket](https://ibb.co/3yChM7R) yet again, finishing the day up over 20% after the announcement of a hydrogen venture with Renault. This joint venture is [expected](https://ibb.co/LhFHnrX) to lead to further developments in fuel cell & hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, that will be based on Renaults platforms, as the companies will combine the manufacturing capabilities of the OEM with the fuel cell & hydrogen system knowledge from Plug Power. It’s expected they will also provide refueling stations to help the ecosystem, in an effort to offer vertical integration with vehicles, fueling stations, services & selling hydrogen fuel to customers. It’s seems a good & interesting development, but I would avoid buying it after such a huge [SPIKE](https://ibb.co/WkGwC79), it should have somewhat of a small pullback sometime soon.

In the Automobile world we also saw GM making a big splash at CES, with announcements of a big [PUSH](https://ibb.co/swv4wn3) into electric vans, a new Venture called BrightDrop that will develop even more electric-powered machinery and the surprise reveal of a [FLYING](https://ibb.co/G5bP3YX) Cadillac, while [TESLA](https://ibb.co/W2H1xrc) just registered its Indian entity just as ARK’s Invest CEO [NOTED](https://ibb.co/qWjZqmF) that Tesla is still way ahead of Apple by taking a page from their own playbook when developing their own chips for the autonomous vehicles. I personally believe that there is enough room for both companies to exist in this new EV path by mostly crushing other traditional OEMs which aren’t good enough at adopting this new trend like Nissan & others.

We also saw Walmart adding even more news on the back of the [FINTECH](https://ibb.co/DVKSgGb) startup, as they are also planning on experimenting with even [MORE](https://ibb.co/g7qgstZ) delivery options, as the company seems to be trying to innovate as much as possible to increase the efficiency, as they try to compete as much as possible with online-purpose [RETAILERS](https://ibb.co/YjMjDLw) that are high flying yet again.

And one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zQBd1L5), is that we saw a report that suggests the iPhone 12 sold 18M units in China in the last quarter of 2020, exceeding all expectations and more than doubling their market share from 10% to over 20%, thus delivering a hit to Asian manufacturers of smartphones. This is exactly what I expected as the new iPhone 12 lineup should be a hit around the world, with many loyal Apple brand followers switching to the 5G technology and to the better camera capabilities. This will also help Apple increase the services business revenue streams, as an increased devices base will lead to increased services usage.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as both the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/HB5P34r) Markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/BgwpqT8) are mixed, with the Nasdaq posting to a small open gain.

The Demise of Netflix is inevitable and why,0.75,"Hello fellow Autists, 

I am here not to talk about the Tesla bubble. But the Netflix bubble that no one is talking about and when popped, autists will be getting fucked to the equivalent of Asa Akira on an episode of Brazzers.  Netflix is a great company, good product but very soon will be outpaced and future earnings reports will begin to show investors how **growth is dying due to competition, life going back to normal from covid, the lack of ability to funnel customers to it's streaming services, and loss of quality content** that is equal to a shitty re-run of the Maury show where a guy finds that is his girlfriend is both his aunt and sister. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hgio2xbcy0b61.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cd79dce1be8173671dcaac08329288d00f0d449

Netflix who has been the background noise hook ups around the world is in a period where they can become the next blockbuster video in 7 years. Market share is being gobbled up by competitors such as Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO Max, Disney plus, Youtube, Apple TV, and direct tv on the go. 

**Growth dying to competition:** The biggest competitive threat to Netflix is probably Amazon. As of the fourth quarter of 2019, Amazon Prime Video had about 150 million subscribers—a number that's been growing at a fast pace over the past two years as the company has increased production of its original content. 

Netflix and Disney had an exclusive relationship, at least until the studio decided to jump into the streaming war. When Disney announced it was going to launch its own service, it ended the deal it had with Netflix. Netflix offered a number of titles from the studio but agreed to cut them all from its lineup in 2019. **Disney owns every Disney movie including every Marvel and Star wars movie that's pretty much every quality movie for fucks sake.** 

Netflix basic package for one person to stream only is $8.99. As of May 2020, package subscriptions to Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ cost $12.99 per month. Subscriptions to just Disney+ cost $6.99 per month or $69.99 per year. Which is way cheaper then a Brazzers subscription. 

The big news for Hulu came in May 2019 with the announcement of a deal between Comcast and Disney which had Disney purchasing Comcast's stake in Hulu for a reported $5.8 billion. This puts Disney in full control of Hulu and consolidates the competition as Disney makes a big push into the streaming services field. 

Netflix investors should be equally worried about AT&T’s new streaming service that launches in 2020. It’ll cost slightly more than Netflix at $16–17 month.

AT&T is best known as a cell phone company. But its purchase of WarnerMedia in 2018 turned it into a media powerhouse. It owns HBO, the most successful premium TV network ever. HBO continues to pump out all-time hits like *The Sopranos, Game of Thrones,* and *Sex in the City.*

**The lack of ability to funnel customers to it's streaming services:** Do you know why the Amazon Echo dot was dirt cheap? Because Amazon wants every household in the United States and the world to have a fucking Alexa in their living room. From that every time you go to order something whether it be a fridge, butt plug, or sweater for your wife's boyfriend you're going to buy it from amazon now. this leads to Amazon prime Throw in the fact that google nest and apple homepod are a thing that are working towards this as well will lead to Netflix becoming a non S&P 500 stock and leave call holders in shambles.

Netflix relies off other companies platforms whether it be Google's search engine to find their website, Ipads with their app, amazon fire stick....its only a matter of time before Netflix is overridden by competitors and left in the dust I believe. 

**Loss of Quality Content:** Netflix's two most watched shows are Friends the The Office which are both now off the streaming service. Family guy isn't on there. Other then Queens Gambit, and a couple other shows its pretty much shit selection and Broke Back mountain that I know you guys like to watch with your boyfriends. Netflix is going to shit and there are rarely blockbuster movies from theaters on there. You cannot tell me the content is getting better....it isn't and the competitors are growing and their content is more entertaining. I know boomer Amazon prime members who canceled Netflix for Amazon prime video. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Look how the stock is flat and has lost momentum while other FANG Stocks are fucking balls to the walls in Retard Strength Momentum](https://preview.redd.it/3de98ecab1b61.png?width=635&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca0cfad8d0924543f2eb6d81bc1164618dcaa57c)

Netflix was revolutionary when it came out. It was the first in streaming and it is getting left in the dust as competitors fight to get their market share in streaming. Even the CEO has admitted the company is trouble. 

Going forward it will succeed or fail on the popularity of the TV shows it produces.  

Over the past year Netflix's debt has shot up 58% to $10.3 billion. For perspective, Netflix earned $1.2 billion in profits last year. 

Netflix’s market cap is about $165 billion—making it the 30th-biggest publicly traded US company. The PE ratio is around 80, meaning every $80 spent is for one dollar of profit.....but **everyday Amazon prime video members, Disney Plus members are cancelling their subscriptions as Netflix tries to raise their prices on their customers and the company is losing quality content every month. Company is overvalued and will struggle to grow.**

Netflix will survive. But it will shrink. Even in the most generous scenario, within three years I can’t see it being worth more than $100 billion. That would put its stock price at about $225/share—or about 40% below its current price. 

Next earnings I am buying a FD Put. 

The Netflix bubble is gonna pop. 

Cannot go tits up.

The new PLUG? Don't miss out!,0.45,"Hey retards,

I've been lurking for some time, finally made an account on Reddit a month ago (not a boomer, I just don't use much social media or related websites) and now I can post. As many of you are probably watching right now, PLUG just flew up to 71.20 AH, and will probably continue its climb as we approach Biden's inauguration. Like many of you, I saw it a week ago in the 30s, watched it soar, and got too scared to FOMO in.

However, a fellow retard dropped the ticker ""BLDP"" in the daily comment section about a week ago, and I decided to YOLO in and buy some Jan15 30C and Feb19 32C. Surely enough, the retard came through, and the stock soared. Nothing too crazy, but daily returns comparable to FCEL/PLUG. Next thing I know, I wake up this morning and find out that my BLDP calls were +500% and +300, respectively, so I ran to the wife's bedroom, asked her boyfriend to help me clean the shit out of my pants that the 5-bagger caused, and then I paper handed and sold for some fat gains (will provide screenshots if people like). Throughout the day, it was sideways with a couple dips, so sure enough, I YOLO'd back in for some Jan15 35C and Feb19 40C.

Now, here we are, and although PLUG may be up 8% AH and everyone is scared to FOMO in, BLDP is only up 7.71% AH (a steal, I know), and it's only going higher. Don't be the paper handed pussy that your wife hates and her boyfriend laughs at. BLDP is heading to the fucking moon \*moon emoji\* \*moon emoji\* \*moon emoji\* \*moon emoji\*, and then to Mars from there. Oh, did I mention that PLUG and FCEL have daily volumes of 90M+, while BLDP is still under 20M? Just wait for the boomers to find out about it....

Anyways, I don't really have any DD, so do with this information what you will. I'm going to diamond hands this shit like I am with my ICLN, and Biden is going to take me straight to tendie town.

TLDR; My positions are BLDP Jan15 35C and Feb19 40C. TBH, it'll probably hit 40 tomorrow or Thursday, once Biden's frail voice hypes up the future of energy.

Edit: Someone asked for tendies, so here you are sir.

SoFi / IPOE growth catalyst overview: Extensive DD on SoFi's rocket boosters,0.95,"[SoFi is going public](https://www.sofi.com/press/sofi-plans-to-go-public) via merger with Chamath's IPOE spac. Here are SoFi catalysts to look forward to:

&#x200B;

**Cash deposits**

SoFi is in talks to roll out [cash deposits](/r/sofi/comments/jwjw1t/sofi_vs_chime/gcrw2o1/). A cash deposit solution will drive increased adoption of SoFi Money over accounts at brick-and-mortar banks. **Cash deposits are a big deal because they are the primary pain point for online banking holdouts.**

&#x200B;

**SoFi-as-a-Service partnerships**

SoFi's consumer digital banking solution is ripe for white label expansion with major brands. The 2020 launch of [Samsung Money by SoFi](https://www.samsung.com/us/samsung-pay/samsung-money-by-sofi/) gives a glimpse of the massive potential.

>Samsung Money by SoFi is the new way to grow your hard-earned cash, letting you save, spend, and earn -- all in one secure place. Now available on Samsung Pay.

Look for more SoFi-as-a-Service deals as consumer brands and dinosaur financial firms seek to catch up.

Not limited to banking services: In October, [T. Rowe Price](https://www.sofi.com/press/sofi-t-rowe-price-retirement-plan-services-team-offer-financial-wellness-offerings-participants/) launched co-branded financial wellness offerings with SoFi.

&#x200B;

**SoFi Member Rewards aka SoFi Points**

Currently in Early Access, SoFi's Member Rewards program is expected to roll out to everyone in 2021.

>The SoFi Rewards program allows eligible members to earn points through various account activities, and then redeem those points as the member sees fit across multiple SoFi products.  
>  
>You can redeem your SoFi Points into cash in your SoFi Money account, into Stock Bits in your SoFi Active Invest account, as an extra payment applied to your SoFi Personal Loan or SoFi Student Loan Refinance, or as a statement credit on your SoFi Credit Card--all from your phone.

Members earn SoFi Points by opening the SoFi app, using the credit card, and by use of other SoFi products. **This program will increase daily app engagement and cross-buy of products.**

Not to be confused with existing [Member Benefits](https://www.sofi.com/member-benefits/).

&#x200B;

**Galileo Financial Technologies**

[SoFi acquired Galileo](https://www.sofi.com/press/sofi-to-acquire-galileo) for $1.2B in April 2020.

From the [S-4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818874/000110465921002757/tm211402-1_s4.htm):

>Galileo provides the infrastructure to facilitate core customer-facing and back-end capabilities, such as account setup, account funding, direct deposit, authorizations and processing, payments functionality, and check account balance features. Additionally, Galileo provides vertical  integration benefits with SoFi Money.  
>  
>Since Galileo is a platform-based business model, we track the number of accounts, which is  defined as an open account as of the reporting date. **As of September 30, 2020, there were over 49 million total open accounts on the Galileo platform.** We view total accounts as an important indicator of the number of Galileo’s customers' own customers who depend on the technology platform for a variety of products and services, including virtual card products, virtual wallets, peer-to-peer and bank-to-bank  transfers, early paychecks, and real-time authorizations.

Galileo's clients include **Robinhood, Chime, Monzo, Revolut, Dave, Klar, Greenlight, bitpay, MoneyLion, Remitly, Uala, Shipt, Tomo, TransferWise**, and many more.

**Galileo is a core infrastructure provider to the global neobank/Fintech industry. SoFi owns 100%.**

Keep up with Galileo using their [Resources](https://www.galileo-ft.com/resources/) page.

&#x200B;

**Social Investing platform and Chamath as an Influencer**

SoFi Invest has a ""[Social Investing](https://www.sofi.com/blog/now-available-social-investing/)"" feature where you can view the holdings, watchlist and performance of other Members (if they opt-in). From there, you can make follow on investments/watches, discuss investments, and leave emojis.

***Will Chamath join SoFi's social investing platform? Seems likely! He is the ideal Influencer investor to promote SoFi.***

The Social Investing platform gives SoFi a means of growing SoFi Invest by bringing notable investors (and their communities) to SoFi. In a hint of things to come, **CEO Noto says: ""... we're on our way to introduce portfolios for those that you're following socially on our platform.""** This might mean one-tap portfolio duplication, or a form of Member/Influencer managed portfolios.

**This platform will increase trade volume by improving discovery and** [**social proof**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof)**.**

Screenshots of the platform with Member names censored:

[CEO Noto's top holdings](https://i.ibb.co/S7S3xfX/Noto-holdings.jpg), [his recent activity](https://i.ibb.co/hfWmFZM/Noto-activity.jpg), [some engagement](https://i.ibb.co/vv5S8GH/Noto-engagement.jpg), and [holding activity when merger news broke](https://i.ibb.co/RcKDDcq/So-Fi-IPOE.jpg).

SoFi hiring favoring experience with [social networks](https://jobs.jobvite.com/careers/sofi/job/oz5cefwO) suggests that Social Investing will continue to evolve.

&#x200B;

**Bank charter**

SoFi received [preliminary approval](https://www.reuters.com/article/sofi-bank-charter/update-1-fintech-startup-sofi-gets-preliminary-approval-for-u-s-bank-charter-idUSL1N2HJ1L7) for their banking charter and is on the way to full approval. The charter will enable SoFi to [lower costs](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818874/000110465921001951/tm211973d1_ex99x2x035.jpg) and compete more aggressively. SoFi hiring is seeking to fill key banking positions.

&#x200B;

**Targeting $1 Billion in 2021 revenue & full year profitability**

SoFi's target looks well within reach. They reported \~$200MM in revenue and a return to profitability for Q3 2020.

>... pulled in about $200 million in revenue in the third quarter and also generated positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and other exceptions, the first time it has done so since 2017, Noto wrote in a letter to shareholders last month.

per [The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/sofi-q3-revenue-hit-200-million-aided-by-low-rates).

&#x200B;

**Credit Card**

Currently in Early Access, the [SoFi Credit Card](https://www.sofi.com/credit-card/) is expected to roll out to everyone in 2021. [Credit Card FAQs](https://support.sofi.com/hc/en-us/categories/360004370091-SoFi-Credit-Card-NEW-).

&#x200B;

**Financial Services Productivity Loop**

The ""FSPL"" is the core of SoFi's B2C products.

From the [S-4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818874/000110465921002757/tm211402-1_s4.htm):

>Our strategy, what we refer to as the ""Financial Services Productivity Loop"", is centered around building trust and a lifetime relationship with our members, which we believe will help build a sustainable competitive advantage. In order to deliver on our strategy, we must develop best in class unit economics and best in class products that build trust and reliability between our members and our platform. When we do this on a member's first product, and they later consider using a second product, they are more likely to start with our platform and we have a higher chance that they will select one of our products to meet their other financial needs. **This results in delivering more revenue per member with no second member acquisition costs, resulting in higher lifetime value per member.** This also reinforces the benefits of our platform, which simplifies the entire financial ecosystem for our members, helping them get their money right. We are able to use the increased profits to further improve member benefits and product experience.

SoFi seeks to fulfill all of a Member's financial needs in one [super app](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErKm-aVVgAIxMyd?format=jpg&name=4096x4096). Here is a [FSPL visual](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818874/000110465921001951/tm211973d1_ex99x2x009.jpg).

How is it going? **SoFi reports 24% overall cross-buy of products for Q3 20. They hit 69% for Home Loans.** As SoFi's products mature and deploy, their cross-buy will continue to grow, while Member acquisition costs will decrease.

&#x200B;

**SoFi International Expansion**

SoFi's international expansion was announced in Q2 2020 with the launch of [SoFi Invest in Hong Kong](https://www.sofi.com/blog/sofi-invest-comes-to-hong-kong/).

>Obviously, we put a lot of thought into where we chose to go with our first international foothold, and Hong Kong made sense to us for several reasons. As one of the financial capitals of Asia and a global financial center, it has a strong base of both novice and sophisticated investors that would benefit from the innovation we could bring to the market.

Members in HK can trade over 15,000 US and Hong Kong stocks for free using the SoFi Hong Kong app. This is one of SoFi's FSPL ""[top of the funnel](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818874/000110465921001951/tm211973d1_ex99x2x024.jpg)"" feeder products. Look for HK offerings to expand.

SoFi has long planned for international expansion. From targeting [mortgages in Australia (old)](https://australianfintech.com.au/us-fintech-sofi-targets-mortgage-lending-in-australia/), [expansion to Canada (old)](https://impactalpha.com/sofi-raises-500-million-to-expand-to-australia-and-canada-441b6d84f1f0/), [Asia and Europe (old)](https://www.altfi.com/article/2322_sofi_going_global_targets_asia_and_europe). SoFi is positioned for international deployment.

&#x200B;

**SoFi Stadium**

SoFi Stadium will drive brand awareness and accelerate trust building. These are both key for growth in consumer finance.

Some major events are already lined up:

>The state-of-the-art stadium re-imagines the fan experience and will host a variety of events year round including **Super Bowl LVI in 2022**, the **College Football Championship Game in 2023**, and the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the **Olympic Games in 2028**.

Located in LA, this massive stadium is packed with benefits for SoFi Members, including line skipping, 10% cash back on concessions and merch, free bag checking, and an exclusive **SoFi Member Lounge**.

SoFi was planning to IPO at the end of 2022, which we can assume was in part due to the expected Super Bowl bump. More info at [SoFi Stadium](https://www.sofi.com/sofi-stadium/).

&#x200B;

**Member Experiences**

SoFi has hosted free in-person Member Experiences for years. These include social events at Top Golf, escape rooms, bars/dining, theaters, sport events, and so on. As well as teaching events in line with SoFi's ""Get Your Money Right!"" ethos. There are big celebration events for Members who have paid off their student loans in full.

When the virus put a pause to in-person events, SoFi expanded their digital experiences. Over 20,000 Members registered for virtual SoFi events in 2020.

As virus re-openings expand, look for [SoFi Stadium](https://www.sofi.com/sofi-stadium/) opportunities and [Member Experiences](https://www.sofi.com/experiences/) to increase.

&#x200B;

**Apex Clearing**

Recognize that name from your brokerage tax forms? SoFi has a \~17% stake in Apex Clearing, which provides brokerage clearing services, margin lending, compliance, transfers, and more.

From the [S-4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818874/000110465921002757/tm211402-1_s4.htm):

>In December 2018, we purchased a 16.7% interest in Apex, which resulted in partial integration of the transaction clearing and asset custody functions integral to SoFi Invest. The investment has also **enabled us to participate in earnings from Apex's customer base**. As of September 30, 2020, our ownership interest in Apex was 16.8%.  
>  
>Our equity method investment in Apex primarily benefits us in two ways: First, it facilitates better planning, coordination and integration in the technology stack for SoFi Invest, which requires clearing brokerage services. **Second, we benefit from the income earned on providing clearing brokerage services to other institutions, and earn fees for margin lending and pay-for-order flow, the latter of which consists of arrangements whereby exchanges and market-makers pay for routing them certain orders.**

Apex's clients include **Ally Invest, M1, Wealthfront, Stash, Betterment**, and others.

Learn about [Apex Clearing's solutions](https://www.apexclearing.com/solutions/).

&#x200B;

**Future acquisitions**

Once SoFi's public listing via spac merger is complete, look for more strategic acquisitions. SoFi will be loaded with \~$3B in cash. Plus their newly public stock as acquisition currency.

Strategic targets may include more infrastructure providers and geographically appealing startups.

SoFi's entry into HK shows the global expansion model: Buy the local regulatory approvals overnight via a small startup, re-brand, and deploy SoFi's tech stack and talent.

&#x200B;

**ARK Invest?**

SoFi has been on ARK's radar for years. It is assumed that ARK will build a position, which will blanket SoFi in ARK's halo. Possible buyers would be funds ARKF (Fintech), ARKW (Next Generation Internet), and perhaps the queen, ARKK.

&#x200B;

**Possible tax solution & other additions**

A couple months ago SoFi [surveyed Members](/r/sofi/comments/jec6xz/sofi_might_be_considering_tax_software/) about a possible tax filing solution. Maybe it will launch for this tax filing season.

At the start of 2021, SoFi asked for input on which new features to prioritize. Such as portfolio analytics, more advanced spend tracking, and debt repayment budgeting. **SoFi continues to iterate and improve their offerings with a focus on the Member.**

Why PLUG is a self-perpetuating fantasy that cannot last forever.,0.71,"Ok... let me explain.

I briefly worked as an intern in the Hydrogen fuel industry in 2019. This, in turn, led me to invest a good sum of my earnings in Tesla, as I had thought I had a good understanding of the EV industry.

First let me explain what solution Hydrogen is the answer to. I firmly believe it is not the answer to energy *production*, but possibly one day for storage. Hydrogen is not found naturally on Earth. It requires loads of energy, typically through hydrolysis (remember high school chemistry?) in order to isolate H2.

Second, Fuel Cell technology is years and years behind battery technology in recent years. Check out how daddy [elon](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/21/musk-calls-hydrogen-fuel-cells-stupid-but-tech-may-threaten-tesla.html) feels about them. There are many additional factors that affect fuel cell functionality, such as air quality and temperature. These limitations are much less severe for batteries.

Also, look at the state of development of the two technologies. EVs are becoming more and more popular every year. Honda and Hyundai each have Hydrogen fuel cells on the market, but you never hear of or see them. Ever see a hydrogen gas refill station? Nope. They barely exist outside of Cali.

Now, I understand much of the idea behind Hydrogen Technology is what's in store for the future, but what about batteries? In what world will we suddenly ditch these very successful batteries that work extremely efficiently today for fuel cells that run on hydrogen that may work well in 20 years?

Previously I said Hydrogen is not the answer for energy production, but maybe one day storage. Though storage is difficult and a pain in the ass, Hydrogen energy can be stored and shipped in tanks. One day, if we eventually as a country have so much excess energy that we can simply perform hydrolysis on water and store the excess hydrogen in a vat, then hydrogen may be the answer. Until then, I see no answer, whether scientific or economic, that would explain further returns for PLUG.

Sorry if this post wasn't autistic enough for this sub, I'm kinda new here.

EDIT: Why is it self perpetuating? Investors see people getting great returns in the hydrogen fuel industry. People speculate and say things like ""it's the fuel of the future"" without really understanding or knowing much about the industry, and since so many financial institutions end up following this mantra, it in turn attracts more and more people to invest. Regardless of profits today, and regardless of decent understanding of the tech. Also, hydrogen tech peaked around 2000 in part via comments made by the Bush admin about investing in hydrogen tech. Plug reached 1k+ in 2000 and since dropped to <100. Doesn't sound great.",2021-01-12 16:02:54

I built a program that detects buzzing stocks on Reddit and Twitter,0.97,"As a poor investor but good developer (or so I like to think), I built a program on python that spots emerging stocks on Reddit and Twitter so y’all can make sweet tendies 🚀

So far, the majority of the picks are small caps so I can’t publish them here based on the sub's rules. However, I still want to share with you all the higher caps that were surfaced.

**For y’all degenerates, just skip those next paragraphs and go straight to the picks. For y’all nerds who want to understand a thing or two about my program, keep on reading.**

* My program, built on Python, scans Reddit and Twitter and bubbles up stocks that just started generating conversations. So we’re not talking about the over discussed stocks like TSLA, PLTR, PLUG and such. We’re talking about the next ones.
* I’ve been beta testing and tweaking the tool for the past year and although, there is room for improvement, it has allowed me to spot and pick up stocks such as PLUG, PENN or NET really early (bought in respectively at $3, $10 and $20) solely based on the tool’s insights.

**Ok, now that this is clear for everyone, here’s how to interpret the stock picks.**

* The percentage increase (+%) is based on a WoW (week on week) analysis. That means I am comparing mentions of a stock/ticker from one week to the previous week. I also use MoM and YoY data to inform the picks (a stock might surface this week based on big news but it might have been mentioned over and over during the year, which means it wouldn’t be considered an “emerging stock” based on my model).
* The “Reasoning” I provide is based on a light research I do on my own before highlighting any of the program’s picks in order to understand why they’re generating conversation. If I find out that they are based on a PnD, I filter the stocks out. If I have any doubt, I filter them out too but will mention them at the bottom of the results so people can form their own opinions.

**Warning**: I am a programmer, not a financial analyst. My goal is to share with you the results my program provides, not recommend any buys.

**Enough said, here’s the (small) list!**

**Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT) +670%**

Market Cap: $6.5bn

Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, focuses on the discovery and development of RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy, and other genetic therapeutic modalities approaches for the treatment of rare diseases.

Reasoning: The stock tanked 51% on Friday due to mixed test results on a gene therapy targeting muscular dystrophy. Note that they have 43 different therapies in their pipeline and 1 received mixed results so far. ARKG owns SRPT and reacted to the news by buying +700k shares.

**Magna International (MGA) +436%**

Market Cap: $22.7bn

Magna International Inc. designs, engineers, and manufactures components, assemblies, systems, subsystems, and modules for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of vehicles and light trucks worldwide. Clients include Aston Martin, BMW, Ford, Daimler, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubish, Peugeot, Citroen, Renault, Nissan, Toyota, Volkswagen, Volvo.

Reasoning: LG and Magna partnered to electrify powertrains last week. Rumors have now spread that Magna could potentially become the manufacturer of Apple’s new car.

Disclaimer: I do not currently own any shares in SRPT. I own shares in MGA.

If y'all find these insights useful, please let me know and I’ll keep sharing them here on a weekly basis :)",2021-01-10 22:00:33

For my ICLN friends

The most established ETF to play this trend is the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF          [ICLN,](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ICLN?mod=MW_story_quote)which covers companies in every geography and in every segment of  alternative energy and boasts almost $5 billion in assets. Perhaps most  important, while it does have some plays with vague EV applications,  such as hydrogen fuel cell stock Plug Power          [PLUG,](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/PLUG?mod=MW_story_quote)it is indeed a play on alternative energy — unlike the some funds, like the Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF         [PBW](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/PBW?mod=MW_story_quote)that roughly tripled last year thanks to boasting Nio          [NIO](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/NIO?mod=MW_story_quote)as a top holding.

If you want to play EVs, there are  plenty of ways to do that. But this iShares ETF is a broader play on  green energy that could do very well in 2021.

Bloom Energy | Hydrogen Fuel Cell | Bigger Than TESLA in 5 years,0.33,"Bloom Energy (BE) will be as big as TSLA in 5 years.

Bloom Energy is a fuel cell company that is transitioning to hydrogen fuel cells in 2021 and have commercial hydrogen fuel cell in 2021.  It's Total Addressable Market is 300B \[2\]\[5\]

Hydrogen will be bigger than Lithium-Ion batteries.  It hasn't thus far because of the cost to produce hydrogen.  ***But with the Biden administration and EU planning to invest heavily invest in solar and wind, the input cost to hydrogen electrolysis should decline enough to make hydrogen as cheap as natural gas*** \[2\]\[6\].  This is why hydrogen is such a huge growth play now.  The economics are only now just about to tip it into be the most economical form of electricity \[3\]\[2\].

The advantage of green hydrogen is that is completely green but as a couple of huge market advantage:

1. More power density than Lithium battery.  What this means is that you can have vehicles going 600 miles unlike lithium battery;  or a small fuel cell footprint vs a large solar footprint for commercial buildings.  Picture  the size of a truck (fuel cell) vs a parking lot (solar) to power a big box retailer.
2. Quick charge.  Fueling a fuel cell would take minutes rather than hours with Lithium batteries.

Note:  blue hydrogen is made from natural gas. grey hydrogen is made from fossil fuel.  green hydrogen is made from wind/solar/hydrodam/nuclear

The EU already moving to a green hydrogen economy \[3\].  Bloom recently hired a GE to expand into the EU for 2021 \[1\]

So comparatively, we have a company with technology comparable to PLUG.

BE made 800M in annual sales for 2020 (natural gas fuel cells).  They plan to address the hydrogen market by 2022. Like PLUG, they plan to have 1GW of capacity 2025.

Lastly, their board is comprise of government insiders and the former CEO of GE \[4\].  So they are well position to gain more regulation in favor of hydrogen and knowledge on how to expand internationally.

You are buying BE for when hydrogen will be the main fuel source starting in 2025 onward. It will overtake Lithium Ion by 2035.  Buying into hydrogen now is like buying into TSLA when it introduce its first lithium ion battery.  And we are only here because of the deep investments in solar and wind to reduce the cost to produce green hydrogen.

"Reeeeeeeeecap of recent market driving news (Jan 8, 2021 weekend Elon chan edition)",0.96,"* Elon chan has supplanted Bezos as the richest bro in the universe. This makes all quants who kept yapping about how TSLA pricing action via option gamma squeeze will subside once it's included in S&P screech in horror. Who knew the meme stock can continue its action unabated? TSLA hits ATH almost everyday this week, closing Friday up 7.84% to $880. Unreal.

* For a succinct difference of Elon chan's prowess vs Bezos, refer to chart below:

Elon | Bezos |
:---------|:----------|
Hot [goth gf](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3a/f1/d6/3af1d61d443906cb37f5ef92d34412b1.png) who will do kinky shit for him | Traded hot milf for botox lady so he can have dirty shit done to him |
Regularly flies astronauts to the fucking space station with his rockets that can fucking land themselves | Have to keep selling AMZN shares to fund his shit space company that's still dicking around with suborbital flight |
Talks about new gigafactory and everyone wants to give him sick tax breaks to build in their city/state | Shops for new second HQ to give high paying white collar jobs but AOC and gang gets up on his ass in asking for tax breaks |

* Morning economic numbers: nonfarm payrolls once again looking terrible, with consensus at about 50k increase but instead saw a -140k Dec. This ends a 7-month streak of steady gains in recovery. No worry fam, if you've lived thru March 2020 lows you'll know that market doesn't give a fuck about employment #s until you go all-in on calls. US reports more than 4k covid deaths for the first time ever - refer to above on why market doesn't give a fuck.

* Flurries of behind-the-scene political actions are happening as the country moves on from Y'all Qaeda's storming of the capitol. A number of high-level admin officials from policy advisors to cabinet members have bailed the sinking ship that is this current administration. Chatters of invoking 25th amendment. Second impeachment. POTUS has stated that he will NOT attend the upcoming inauguration (who knew he's a gdamn snowflake?), after finally putting out a statement that an orderly transition will occur. 

* Psuedo-SJW social media companies and platforms have banned POTUS in tandem, conveniently doing so after the Dems have clinched both chambers of Congress and will likely sit on committees regulating them. No real movements from these actions yet, though TWTR is pulling back after it banned POTUS for 12 hours until he deleted the offending Tweet. TWTR closed the day down -1.62% to $51.48, after an intraday low of more than -2%.

* BA got a slap on the wrist with a 2.5 bil fine from the DOJ for killing non-Americans. About 10% of the fine goes to the US govt while about 500 mil goes to the families of the 346 people that died in the two 737 Max crash. Remaining (70%) amount goes to BA customers because let's face it, corporations are truly the ones really hurting. BA closed down -1.32% to $209.

* It's a solid day for many Chinese ADRs as as BABA and TCEHY escape Treasury's list of delisting stonk. BABA closed up 4% for the day at $236 while TCEHY closed up 5.61% to $76.89. NIO, the TSLA of China (or is it XPEV? or LI? find out in 1.5 years!) closed up big at 8.55% to almost $59, despite offering to sell 68m more shares last month at $39. Surely the US market isn't going to be China Hustled.

* Today's big movers: DDD and PLUG continues their wild rocket moves to the stratosphere as strong market sentiment continues. DDD closed up 2.48% to $23.54, after touching an intraday high of almost 10% earlier. PLUG closed up 13% to $53.78.

* PSTH, Ackman's brainchild SPAC flew almost 12% today on ZERO news but faded towards end of the day. PSTH gang collectively jizzed and made a mess of themselves. Will it be Stripe? (it's not) Chick-fil-A? (it's not) Bloomberg? (eh they sorta denied it) Subway? (please god no). Find out eventually sometime Q1 2021 as Bill continues to edge us. Seriously Bill, announce something amazing already because I'm up more than 20k on zero news and I'm tempted to sell. PSTH closed up 7.24% to $29.32.

* In WSB meme stock land, a new law is being formed where none of these gdamn stock can go up together on the same day. PLTR faded to flat of 0.80% after being up more than 3% during early mornings, whereas GME and MT both fade some more today after a decent run-up attempt this entire week. GME close the day down -2.16% to $17.69, while MT pulls back from a week's worth of solid gain at -2.7% to $24.83. WSB's new meme ETF ICLN had some profit taking happened much to the displeasure of people who fomo into the ETF this morning, not realizing the sea of red candles were not bullish indicators. ICLN close the day down slightly to -0.75% to $33.15. Funny enough, OTM monthly calls haven't pulled back that much due to the magic of IV.

* While initially red through out most of the day, the DOW reversed course and closed up 0.18% or 56 pts, S&P up 0.55% or 20 pts, Nasdaq up a solid 1% or 134 pts, and RUT closed flat at -0.25% or -5 pts. It's the weekend and WSB newcomers addicted to FDs will no doubt flood the weekend thread, constantly asking if their $700 portfolio (funded in part by the $600 stimulus) with OTM calls will be okay. Don't worry new fam, stonk only goes up.

Wind Energy Market in the US: ICLN and Vestas,0.85,"I’m very new to all this (started trading 2 weeks ago), so I might be wrong, but, as I understand it, ETFs will take the profits from the shares that moon and dump them into their other holdings. Wind energy is one of the biggest untapped markets in the US, especially in places like Texas where there hasn’t been much funding. So I’m, with my very limited knowledge, guessing that ICLN will dump their PLUG profits into their only wind holding: Vestas

So I have a couple questions:
1) Am i a retard
2) why is the ticker I’m seeing (VWDRY) different from the one iShares lists
3) I was told that this is a foreign stock in the form of an American Depository Reciept (ADR) so I can’t buy calls, but why isn’t that the case for something like BABA and will that ever change?
4) are there any other wind stocks that might be better? of course, I’m hedging on the cycle of ICLN dumping into this, the stock rising because everyone else buys too, and then ICLN buying more to keep up with demand, but there could be other options",2021-01-08 08:17:14

"Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is the ENPH for 2021🚀 Hope you listened last time - Still lots of room for huge gains - warrants, calls, commons",0.83,"This is my second post for Infrastructure and Energy Alternative. Hope you fuckers listened last time  
   
\*I have to actually spell out the company name because this dumb subreddit thinks its still a spac (its not and hasn’t been since 2018). The ticker is just the first letter of each word

Hopefully you listened to me last time:  
 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaskh2/infrastructure\_and\_energy\_alternative\_is\_the\_next/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaskh2/infrastructure_and_energy_alternative_is_the_next/)

You probably didn’t and chased some shitty call option that failed.

At the time of that post Infrastructure and Energy Alternative commons were at $11.30 and warrants at $1.50. Commons now are tickling $20 (almost double) and warrants around 4 (2.5x gain). Not bad.

You’re probably wondering why I would still recommend Infrastructure and Energy Alternative after the nice run it has had recently. Well, with 2bn in revenue and now with the dems taking Georgia, we are going to see TRILLIONS of dollars pour into green energy this year and onwards. The best part is Infrastructure and Energy Alternative still sits at a paltry 420mm market cap (less than 0.25x revenue). 

Yesterday you saw all 3 othet green energy stocks: Cleanspark, FCEL and PLUG run 30% even though all 3 are already madly overvalued. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is the best deal of the 3 and still has a ton of room to run. It is clear that green energy is going to boom this year.

Motley fool had an interesting mention of Infrastructure and Energy Alternative today too:  
 [https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/06/why-blink-charging-vulcan-materials-and-infrastruc/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/06/why-blink-charging-vulcan-materials-and-infrastruc/)

I know you won’t click the link to read it but here is the important part  
 

*Indeed, Infrastructure & Energy Alternatives just might turn out to be the most promising of these three stock opportunities. Although the company reported only $13.2 million in net profit over the past 12 months according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), that number is more than twice what Infrastructure and Energy Alternative earned last year. Moreover, free cash flow generation at Infrastructure and Energy Alternative was a very robust $68.6 million over the past year. At a market capitalization of just $410 million, that works out to an ultra-cheap price-to-free cash flow ratio of less than six.*

*Almost entirely uncovered on Wall Street, Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives could be the small-cap stock to watch in 2021.*

Best part, like they just mentioned, is Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is STILL NOT DISCOVERED BY WALL STREET. This is still ground floor. Potential ENPH type move in 2021 for Infrastructure and Energy Alternative. 🚀

If you look at the Infrastructure and Energy Alternative chart, there is a very obvious pattern that has been happening since summer. It moons roughly 80-100% then dips 30% and consolidates… rinse and repeat. It looks like it just finished its recent consolidation in the 16-17 area and is ready for its next leg up to $30.

Funds have been adding mad in the most recent consolidation period between $15-$17. The volume is regularly over 1million now when just a month ago it was a struggle to hit 500-700k. It is clear that funds are starting to find Infrastructure and Energy Alternative. It was also recently added to a few ETF’s and index’s. 

IMO Infrastructure and Energy Alternative will see $30 relatively soon. $30 on the commons gives us $10 warrants. When you hit the $10 warrants (or whatever price youre happy with) you can then flip then into the commons and let them ride throughout 2021.

You can obviously buy calls but I think warrants are the better deal here for the potential 100% move + in the short and midterm.

P.s. read through my previous wsb post (link at the top) if youre interested in the deeper numbers regarding Infrastructure and Energy Alternative. This is ENPH for 2021 baby.

"Stock Market News for Today | RUN, ENPH, TLRY, ACB, NIO, ROKU, CAT, F & Other Stock News [01-07]",0.97,"**Stocks go bonkers while the Dems take Georgia. The Capitol is breached. Is this the time to buy Solar, Pot & Industrial stocks? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a mixed day with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/nsJ4qqL) leading the way up over 400points and closing at a new record high, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/kKxbFdQ) also finishing 0.57% up for the day, while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/C7CdfX8) finished the day down 0.6%. All 3 of the big indexes were trading higher earlier in the day before the [VIX](https://ibb.co/4PR24Fc) saw a spike of more than 10% as rioters [STORMED](https://ibb.co/KjbQPkD) the US Capitol, before eventually getting back to certifying the electoral votes, which brought back some stability. This was a very bad incident but shouldn’t have long-lasting effects on the stock market.

Yesterday we saw almost 70% of [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/Br0Y0hB) advancing with over 300 new highs as the volume also spiked up, as 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/FmhD70s) finished in the green with Banks , Energy and Materials gaining more than 3%, while the biggest loser was by far the tech sectors, dropping 1.7%, as we saw Large-Cap Growth companies underperforming the [MARKET](https://ibb.co/XpbdM7p), while small & mid-caps, especially the value plays, outperformed the market.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/WKhNSZh) from yesterday which shows how Big tech companies suffered yesterday, as the perceived threat of increased [TAXES](https://ibb.co/D79SMMP) spooked the market, while the Industrials, Banks, Green Energy & [POT](https://ibb.co/XZFHGvj) stocks flourished on the hope of a big stimulus with new & improved regulations, as it is expected that there will be an improved legislation that will help the cannabis stocks soar and the possible big stimulus would be a huge boost to most of the [RETAIL](https://ibb.co/GfwgQ3Z) sector which saw names like Nordstrom, GameStop, Target and many others posting big moves to the upside. Joining them should be [COSTCO](https://ibb.co/pQdXm2H), which did lag yesterday, but posted terrific December numbers after hours, with comparable sales increasing more than 10% while e-commerce rose by more than 60% for the month.

Yesterday we also saw the [FED](https://ibb.co/mFgqXN4) deciding to continue the current QE pace, as they still see plenty of uncertainty around, especially in the first quarter of 2021. They will continue to buy $120B worth of securities every month, as well as possibly moving on to some lengthier term maturities, while being opened to even more monetary easing if necessary.

In some more good news, we saw the [Factory Orders](https://ibb.co/jRqfPf7) for November coming it at +1%, better than expected as shipments increased by 0.7%.

While in some other not so good numbers we saw the December [PMI](https://ibb.co/7XjyFjB) slowing to 55.3, less than the 55.7 expected and 58.6 in the previous month, but this is still an indicator of expanding business activity, while ADP [numbers](https://ibb.co/kJ6jjRx) came in worse than expected, as the US lost 123K nonfarm jobs, worse than the 130K addition of jobs expected and 304K jobs gained in the previous month, as we saw a big loss of jobs in large business especially in the leisure/hospitality [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/9sCLVqY). This was the first [month](https://ibb.co/3F8Q9j0) since April when we saw a lose of jobs in the nonfarm private business.

[TODAY](https://ibb.co/vsB6NM2) we have a loaded economic data calendar starting with jobless numbers early in the morning and finishing with the Fed Balance Sheet at the market close.

In some other stock market news, we saw a report that [ROBLOX](https://ibb.co/3yqfGFZ) is looking to go public via direct listing, rather the traditional IPO. The latest funding round at $45/share saw the company valued at almost $30B, which is very high but we have to see the latest books of the company before making a prediction if it will go higher or not. This may be a better opportunity for retail investors to get in at lower prices, rather than buying at 2-3 times the IPO price.

So, guys, due to the latest political developments we have seen a huge shift in the markets, as we saw yesterday the [SOLAR](https://ibb.co/KWH2wHh) stocks having spectacular gains with Sunrun, & SunPower gaining more than 16% with many other companies like [ENPHASE](https://ibb.co/72jTgdq) also soring, while the hydrogen play Plug Power also [soared](https://ibb.co/xDxrq80) more than 20% in after-hours after agreeing to a collaboration with SK Group.

We also saw gambling names move up after with the Senate changing leadership and states like New York pushing for the legalization of [gambling](https://ibb.co/CPFdVpv) in most of the US.

We also saw other companies posting great numbers, with [T-Mobile](https://ibb.co/qC2rXQC) adding 5.5M customers, its best ever number as they lead the industry, while [ROKU](https://ibb.co/qxWCNg4) continued to be one of the best plays in the streaming business alongside Disney & Netflix as they have surpassed 50M accounts.

And on the industrial side we saw companies like Caterpillar and US Steel posting big gains in anticipation of an infrastructure bill that would greatly benefit them.

[Ford](https://ibb.co/yNz7PjD) also beat expectations with a decline in sales of just under 10%, better than the 14% expected as the company continues to move towards more trucks, SUVs & EVs.

On the other-hand we also saw [Chinese](https://ibb.co/rbRQwyq) tech and EV stocks fall, after more bad headlines like the US looking to ban even more big companies in the US like Alibaba & Tencent. This is a continuing story which has peaked up steam in the recent year after the political tensions between the US and China have increased. This companies were also joined by the big tech which continued to face selloff pressure after the blue sweep in Georgia.

My opinion is that you should start buying some green energy, pot and industrial stocks but you shouldn’t go to heavy on the first day. You should wait for things to cool-off a little and not buy everything at the top. I think a bi-weekly split strategy or monthly strategy would be nice. Which would mean you should divide your investment money and buy especially on red days every couple of weeks or on a monthly basis, but I would avoid Chinese stocks for now at least.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/LCv8Dp1) markets are mixed while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wghkCJ1) seem to be pointing at a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way,  though in the last few days every single time the futures were up the stocks finished lower and vice-verse, when the futures were red the stocks finished higher, so you shouldn’t base your investment on this. 

Thank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market!

Have a great day and see you next time!",2021-01-07 13:03:51

Buy EV or Green Energy stocks for the Georgia runoffs because Democrats will win,0.85,"There is a lot of data that suggests Democrats will win the senate and green energy stocks like $FSR and $PLUG will moon if Dems get the senate.

First off, I did correlation analysis between Biden vote share and early turnout in the runoff as a percentage of November 2020 early vote. The correlation is strong, approximately .45. In other words, the early voting has been remarkably favorable towards the Democrats. I got my data from [georgiavotes.com](https://georgiavotes.com). Here is the link to the google sheet I put the data in. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pBDLDZZRPSzhqE1nU6t98mY1wfkOtuOftlQUiY8msOw/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pBDLDZZRPSzhqE1nU6t98mY1wfkOtuOftlQUiY8msOw/edit#gid=0)

Secondly, this is small but anecdotal evidences shows rural polling places have not been busy today. The only way Republicans win the Georgia runoff is with huge election day turnout. That is very unlikely in a runoff election without Trump on the ballot.

Lastly, there is polling that shows a wide swath of Republican voters feel like they should boycott the runoff. [https://twitter.com/cstewartiii/status/1346296064572321792](https://twitter.com/cstewartiii/status/1346296064572321792)

Seems like the market has not priced this in so I'm going HAM on calls.

Option Purchases Over 100K 12/23 - 12-31,0.9,"In this post I will be looking at major option purchases from 12/23 - 12/31. The goal of this analysis is to see if the 'smart money' is worth following or if they are just as good or maybe even worse than retail.

The criteria for this analysis is option purchases where the total premium is over $100,000. This helps me filter out the noise created by some of the larger retail traders. Additionally, I removed contracts where the expiration was last week as I think it will be more interesting to follow contracts that have a future expiration. This left me with a total of 735 positions entered between 12/23 - 12/30 where the premium was over $100,000. My data is collected over multiple sources and I do my best to make sure there is no redundant or false information.

The Columns to pay attention too:

* EXP: Expiration of the contracts
* Strike: Strike Price where the contract can be bought if it is exercised
* Option Price: How much premium paid per contract
* Premium Paid: Total amount spent (option price x quantity)

# Call Flow

[Call Flow](https://preview.redd.it/asn0bkz3de961.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=3365d254c4a27fe89e48f04324a8f46666459e5f)

To start I looked at call option flow. To simplify things I looked at the top 25 option call flows based on premium. Its worth noticing how many times TESLA is on the above list (8/25). Beside TSLA none of the call flow is really so reaching and for the most part pretty safe. The tickers in the above list are 'XPEV', 'CRM', 'TSLA', 'NKE', 'BABA', 'GM', 'PINS', 'BIDU', 'ZM', 'EEM', 'PLNT', 'MSFT', 'EBAY', 'SPX', 'MA', and 'DIS'.

# Put Flow

[Put Flow](https://preview.redd.it/ncsrdwq6de961.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=012a637965c0b17d98d990119d052ec22933efeb)

Some worth paying attention to on the above list are the SPY 2/19/21 354 Puts, QS 2/19/2021 80 Puts, CDLX 4/16/2021 PUTS as these expire relatively soon and would require a decent pull back to end In The Money. The tickers in the above list are 'PLUG', 'AAPL', 'SPY', 'ARKK', 'IWM', 'UAL', 'QS',  'LMND', 'CDLX', 'OLLI', 'GLD', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'QQQ', 'TAN'.

# Target Flow

The targeted option flow is calculated based on specific criteria I have used to trade over the last year. I call it Targeted Flow because this is typically where I find the best results. Essentially it is a mixture of volume, open interest, premium, expiration date and % move required. Interestingly out of all the options flow my algorithm picked up between 12/23 and 12/31 all of the ""Targeted Flow"" was Calls. As you can see all of the EXP below are for 1/15/2021 meaning the option flow buyers expect a big upwards move quickly.

&#x200B;

[Targeted Flow](https://preview.redd.it/040n3avbde961.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7b98cbe2929d39c27a068f58ed8a5f6a73feeb7)

Once again 8/25 Targeted Flows are TSLA. This really shouldn't be surprising, but I am amazed at how truly bullish TSLA is. Contracts on this list that I think are worth investigating are CSIQ, GSX, IQ, TSM and FDX, but do what you wish with this information. One thing that stands out to me in this Target Flow is that 69/69 of the option flow my algo picked up were all calls (as I said above). Typically when the market is leaning so far in one direction the opposite happens so it will be real interesting to see how the next two weeks play out. Based on how today is going I think we see lower over the next two weeks into the 1/15/21 exp.

Just for fun here is the TSLA call flow with over $100,000,000 in premium.... CRAZY

"1 Year, 100% ROI Challenge! January Thread + First Trade.",0.92,"**Update (1/8/21):**

I took a very big risk trading QS, and have been getting hammered hard by it recently. However, things are not as bad as they appear, when you consider the insane amount of premium I am collecting...

My true cost basis is $65 - $5.50 premium = $59.5 / share. After selling a single weekly covered call, that cost basis will drop to around $54 / share. Each additional weekly CC will continue to drop the cost basis over time. Which means **even with the stock I own being down 20% from my entry, I would still end up with a profit.** That is the power of selling extremely high IV options.

Only if QS tanks well below $50, and stays there for months on end, do I risk an actual loss on this trade. I just hope that doesn't happen...

**Update (1/17/21):**

Well, I really picked a dogshit stock, and now I'm stuck bagholding 100 shares of it...

QS has tanked hard consistently and is now down a whopping 21% from my entry point. Still, I'm going to follow my general rule and not close this position for a loss. I need to find the breakeven covered call. Which means: the intersection point where premium gained from the CC reduces my cost basis to match the strike price of the same CC. At the moment that appears to be almost exactly ATM.

**Option: QS 54c 1/29 = $5.50 premium**

**Cost basis: $65 (assignment) - $5.50 (CSP premium) - $5.50 (CC premium) = $54**

Again, this is the power of Theta Gang on high IV stocks, and why it will always outperform ""buy and hold."" Even with the stock being down 20%, I can still break even at the current price, and all I will have lost is time. Anyone who simply bought shares at the same exact time I entered my CSP would now be down 20% with little hope of recovery. I will of course have to reevaluate the prices Tuesday morning.

**LESSON LEARNED:** Don't be greedy. I was too enticed by the extremely high premium on QS. If I would have continued the more conservative PLTR play from last week, I'd be sitting pretty right now. Hopefully I can still recover and get this challenge back on track next week.

Positions and ROI to be updated Tuesday morning.

**Update (1/20/21):**

Another horrible -7% day for the QS shares we are bagholding. This stone looks like it will never stop dropping. I need to earn premium more quickly to reduce this cost basis as fast as possible. I went with a 30DTE option for $630 to drop my cost basis down to $51.50 per share. Luckily the IV is still sky high, making these significant cost basis reductions possible. However, if this continues tanking through the end of the month, we may just be done for...

=========================================

**Current Positions: 100 QS @ $65.00 (true cost basis: 65 - 5.5 - 1.7 - 6.3 = $51.50)**

**-1 QS 52c 2/5 @ 6.30**

**-1 PLTR 24.5p 1/29 @ 0.80**

**Current ROI: 0.7%**

**Projected ROI: 12.8%**

# Introduction

**Happy New Year!** **TL;DR- I am going to double a small account over a year, and you are going to watch.**

Three months ago I wrote up a guide on consistently outperforming the S&P500 using Theta Gang strategy. That guide got a lot of positive feedback, and I suggest those who missed it take a look. [How to CONSISTENTLY Outperform the S&P500 using Theta Gang Strategy. A Comprehensive Guide to Wheeling ETFs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how_to_consistently_outperform_the_sp500_using/) And if you are truly retarded check out my recent Tips for Noobies. [Top 5 Tips Every Noobie Trader MUST Know.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4ztif/top_5_tips_every_noobie_trader_must_know/)

I've since decided to put my skills to the test and will attempt to double a small $8000 account by the end of 2021 using similar strategies. This will mostly be an educational experience, and I will walk you through all my thought processes and my trades as I make them so hopefully the retards among you can learn a thing or two. And if I blow up the account, that will be entertaining as well, right?

Some of the less experienced among you may think this is a simple feat. The more experienced among you will know achieving such consistently high returns will be an incredibly difficult feat. I put my odds of success somewhere around 20% to be honest. But it will be a good education for both of us. Really, I only need to achieve around 6% return every month to break 100% by the end of the year (after compounding), and put in those terms the task doesn't sound so daunting, does it?

Still, I will be forced to make some very aggressive, downright risky plays in order to make this remotely possible. If my wheeling ETF guide was about a safe, conservative strategy, this guide will be the opposite. Keep that in mind if you are foolish enough to copy my trades.

Wish me luck... I will need it.

# Basic Strategy

I will not leave any tool off the table here. If I see an opportunity, I will take it. But for the majority of my trades I will be using a very simple strategy. Find high implied volatility stonks and sell options on them. I will typically be selling cash-secured puts since naked calls carry excess risk, which means I want to look for stocks I am generally bullish on long-term.

Using ToS I've set up some very basic filters to scan for promising stocks to trade:

**1) Option Implied Volatility >80% (for tendies)**

**2) Stock Volume >5,000,000 (for liquidity)**

**3) Market Cap >$1B (to comply with WSB rules)**

**4) Stock Price <$82 (collateral maximum)**

Scanning with these filters brings up a lot of familiar names: GME, PLTR, QS, NKLA, LAZR, FCEL, UVXY, ACB, XPEV, SPCE, and so on. In other words, the type of stonks retards like you are buying expensive options on...

# Running the Numbers

I will try to not get too technical and into the weeds with this experiment. I'll be using some very basic math to decide which options to sell. I highly recommend you play around with the numbers on options to really get an intuitive feel for how they work. For example, if I were to ask you what happens to the relative cost of premium ($/day) as DTE increases on an option, what would be your answer? If you don't know, just run some simple numbers to find out...

SPY premium / DTE = $/day

332 / 5 = 66.4

440 / 10 = 44

652 / 21 = 31

1915 / 140 = 13.7

As you can see, premium cost per day decreases as time till expiration increases. (It's more complicated than that of course, but we are keeping it simple here). For that reason I will be doing something I generally don't advocate: Selling weeklies to squeeze a bit of extra juice out of my options. This also means I will be holding them all to expiration to deal with issues like higher gamma.

Here is another simple equation I can use to give me a lot of information:

**(Premium \* 365) / (DTE \* Strike) = Max ROI**

Basically what I'm doing is estimating the returns from selling the same option for an entire year with a 100% success rate. Since I'm aiming for 100% ROI, any options I sell will need to be over 100 in this formula. Of course, I won't have a 100% success rate on my trades, so I should probably aim even higher to give myself some buffer, maybe around 120. Let's try it on some \~ATM options to get a relative comparison of option value:

SPY: 12.2

PSTH: 48.1

GME: 140.5

PLTR: 111.1

QS: 263.7

UVXY: 134.2

Don't put too much stock in these numbers. I'm just using them as a simple comparative tool for judging the profitability of different options.

We can glean even more information from the above number if we multiply it by the Prob. ITM% of course, to get something closer to an ""Expected Value"" for an option, which I will perhaps go into more detail on next month.

Finally I'll be throwing around various other calculations as I go, $/day, ROI/month, premium/collateral, and so on. I will need to watch all of these and more to reach my goal.

# My First Trade

Looking at the stocks in my filter, there are two that really stand out to me: GME and PLTR. That's right, everyones favorite meme stocks!

GameStop is interesting as a short-term play, and has very high IV. But I'm not confident in the company as a long-term play, and would hate to be assigned hundreds of shares of that shitty brick and mortar hellscape. Palantir, on the other hand, has serious growth potential long-term and I would not mind being assigned. It has also been hit hard recently and is at a more reasonable entry level, which also makes it a good choice. **Therefore, I will be trading PLTR as my first play.**

I want to sell an OTM put to give myself some downside protection against a further drop, but not so far OTM that I can't break my 100% ROI goal. Let's plug some of the Jan. 15 options into my formula above to get a breakdown of the potential ROI.

21 strike: 74.2

22 strike: 108.4

22.5 strike: 131.9

23 strike: 155.5

Either the 22 or 22.5 strikes are right near the sweet spot we are looking for in terms of return. Of course conditions will likely change on Monday and I may need to reassess, but at the moment my current play seems to be:

**Sell to Open 3 contracts of PLTR 22p 1/15.**

If Monday opens red it will be even better for us, since we get in at a cheaper price with likely higher IV on top. So I for one am praying for a bloody Monday for Palantir (sorry bagholders).

Of course after selling 3 contracts at 22 strike, we will only have used $6600 of our $8000 capital. I may need to look for one more smallish trade on a stock in the $14 range to take full advantage of our capital. If GME drops on Monday we could consider a far OTM play there, for instance.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR- I am going to double a small account, and you are going to watch.**

I will update this post as plays are made, and will create a new post each month as a recap. As always questions are welcome.",2021-01-01 16:39:33
Big move coming for PLUG & AMC | Smart Money play,0.87,"Today I noticed how strong PLUG was compared to the overall market. On top of that options pool activity showed a shit ton of calls bought and alot of puts sold today. All day just bullish call activity. News coming sometime next week. Maybe Monday. Tomorrow above $36. Notice the $36 puts sold expiring tommorow. Could test 52 week highs

[https://imgur.com/Q6BU5fR](https://imgur.com/Q6BU5fR)

As majority of people believe that AMC is going bankrupt soon in january but I believe that they will be saved. Either a buyout or something else. News coming soon. Today the stock hit close to its 52 week lows and looking at the daily chart all the way from march, I believe today was the bottom and should go back up. Also Smart money bought alot of call options for march 2021 and 2022 - $2.5  and $8 calls respectively. Someone believes this will go back up soon. Too big to fail but trade carefully.

Story from a retard - PLTR hole the line,0.88,"OK listen up. Here is a story for everyone. I used to be a young retard. Now I'm an old one. But there are some lessons to be learned from my young dumb and full of cum self. 

Lets take a trip to 2014. Graduated college and man I was going to make it big. Just moved to the city and I figured something out no one else did. swing trading. easy money. (so retarded I was buying and selling with a 7 dollar commission for each trade on merril edge). 

Well, I lost a lot of money. bar mitzvah money bye bye lmao. you know how long it took to get my hands on that moolah. 

But here is the lesson. Here is what I learned, and why I am going to HOLD PLTR FOR LONG TIME. These companies i bought. They kind of made it. in 2014, they seemed like a long shot. i lost money on almost all of them because they would go down 5-10% and i would be out. but if i held, man I would be looking good. 

Here are some of the positions from my 2014 realized gains/losses: 

Ariad Pharmacuticals - 2.1k shares. lost 840 dollars. Ariad was eventually bought by a japenese company i think and shot up like 70%. Fuck. 

Plug Power - 1,123 shares. all around 2.50. made 160. woohoo! We all know what happened with plug. 

Groupon - 110 shares at 8.54. At one point this this was like 130. lost 14 dollars. 

Irobot - 250 shares at around 48. lost $1,845. 

And these are just some examples, also had ballard power (loss), disney (small gain) etc. wow i suck.

If i just let these sit, well coulda woulda shoulda. But I will not make the same mistake again, I have 390 shares of PLTR and I AM HOLDING BECAUSE I BELIEVE AND I HAVE LEARNED PATIENCE. 

blah blah blah boomer shit. PLTR set it and forget it. This thing will go up. I'm a fuckin retard don't listen to me",2020-12-29 22:15:05

Renewables and latest COVID stimulus,0.94,"The stimulus was signed today. The US market is expected to rally, but expect larger gains on the renewables market for the next few days.

The 2021 US budget, which includes the $900 billion COVID stimulus bill, also includes sweeping measures on combating climate change and push for renewable energy:

**$35 billion on renewable energy research and development**

This includes solar (*TAN*) and wind R&D (*FAN*), upgrading the Energy department sustainable transport initiative (*XL sounds interesting*), developing decentralized smart energy grids (*GRID*), and high-risk R&D.

**Tax credit extensions on renewable energy projects**

Solar projects get a two-year extension on tax credits, while onshore wind projects get an extra year. Offshore wind projects finally get its own tax credit, while carbon capture and waste-to-energy credits are extended as well.

Fuel cell vehicles get an extension (*PLUG, FCEL*), as well as electric motorcycles. Non-hydrogen fuel refueling installations also get an extension.

Energy-efficient home installations retain its tax credit. Energy projects in commercial buildings are now given permanent tax credit (*HASI is a close fit*).

**Other provisions**

Hydro-chlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are to be phased out in 15 years. Low-income families get additional subsidies to install renewable energy in their homes. Excise taxes on coal and oil are extended.

&#x200B;

**Caveats and future events that could make or break the rally**

The Georgia senate runoff elections will dictate the control of the executive and legislative branches. A Republican win can stall the meteoric rise of renewables but it is still expected to gain significantly for 2021. Expect IV in renewables to be high for at least a week after the election, as the decision may not be finalized immediately.

**Recommendations**

It's never too late to hop on the renewables train. 🚀

"Merry Christmas, here's my DD on BABA",0.91,"News broke yesterday that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) formally started an antitrust investigation of Alibaba. The stock plummeted by more than 7% in after and pre-market trading. This is the latest development in the ongoing story of a deterioration in relations between Alibaba and the CCP following Jack Ma's harsh criticisms of China's financial regulators on stage at a Shanghai conference in October.

Read on for an analysis of the relationship between CCP and Alibaba and whether BABA is a buy, hold, or sell after this news.

# What exactly happened?

China's State Administration for Market Regulation released a [very brief statement](http://www.samr.gov.cn/xw/zj/202012/t20201224_324638.html) declaring that it has begun an antitrust investigation of Alibaba over suspected monopolistic conduct including the ""picking one from two"", or ""二选一"" policy. This policy forces online merchants to sell exclusively on one platform and is actually widespread in China's ecommerce market.

Alibaba responded publicly with an equally brief and terse statement.

>""Today, Alibaba Group has received notification from the State Administration for Market Regulation that an investigation has been initiated into the Company pursuant to the Anti-Monopoly Law. Alibaba will actively cooperate with the regulators on the investigation"".

# Analysis

There are three scenarios that can play out, ranging from mild, moderate, to severe. The following is a high level summary of each with a conclusion on what I believe is the most plausible outcome.

## Mild

The CCP is simply seeking to teach Jack Ma a lesson in humility. The antitrust investigation results in minor changes to the regulatory oversight of Alibaba and perhaps even a small fine. Jack Ma falls back in line and business as usual ensues.

This outcome implies buying BABA on this dip.

## Moderate

To preserve it's own interests and validity, the CCP is seeking to make a strong example out of Jack Ma and his companies. This is just the start of a long string of bad news between the CCP and Alibaba to inflict maximum pain on Jack Ma. A potential outcome for Alibaba could be heavy fines and heavy regulatory oversight that effectively sacrifices Alibaba in favor of more obedient domestic firms.

This outcome implies selling BABA and trimming exposure to other Chinese companies until new information emerges suggesting that relations are improving.

## Severe

The CCP pulls the plug on the Variable Interest Entity (VIE) structure that allows Alibaba and other Chinese companies to list in the US. In a VIE, the Chinese company sets up intermediate companies registered outside of China, thus outside of the CCP's jurisdiction. These companies own X% of the Chinese company and has a contractual obligation to X% of the company's profits but not the company nor its assets. These offshore intermediate companies then list on US exchanges and effectively give US investors ownership of the company (but not really, just the company's profits). For Alibaba, its intermediate offshore company is domiciled in the Cayman Islands.

VIEs are a legal grey area under Chinese law. In 2015, the CCP drafted legislation banning them but didn't follow through. In 2019, they approved legislation with an updated definition of what is considered foreign investment that conveniently doesn't mention VIEs. This was interpreted as an implicit approval. Why wouldn't China approve of VIEs given that they are a significant source of foreign direct investment in Chinese companies? However, not mentioning VIEs also keeps the CCP's options open to pull the plug whenever.

As it pertains to the current spat between Alibaba and the CCP, a possible outcome is the CCP banning VIEs and effectively ending foreign ownership of domestic companies. All Chinese companies listed in the US would have to be delisted.

## What's the most plausible outcome?

To the market, given everything that is known, the most plausible outcome is the Moderate case. This is as much because of the information at hand as well as the lack of information. What we know so far is that relations between Jack Ma and the CCP have deterioriated. What we don't know is how severe the deterioration is and how much pain does the CCP want to indirectly (and perhaps directly) inflict on Jack Ma through his corporate empire. So far, there is no indication that the CCP is getting off the case of Jack Ma and this presents significant risks for institutional investors. To make matters worse, the CCP acts on the behest of a single person, Xi Jinping, and a single person's opinions and actions are much more volatile than a commitee's. This only adds to the uncertainty of the present situation. What do institutional investors do in the face of uncertainty? They sell for safer bets.

A common argument against the Moderate case is that China is unwilling to hurt its geopolitical crown jewel. Alibaba is a key piece in China's strategy to satiate its hefty appetite for global soft power and the CCP hurting Alibaba beyond any surface wounds only hurts itself. The fall of BABA collapses the credibility of Chinese companies internationally and reduces foreign direct investment in China. On the surface, this argument holds weight but there are several holes. First and foremost, as much as the CCP desires to project global soft power, its number one priority is maintaining domestic power and legitimacy. There is little information on how much of a threat Xi perceives Jack Ma to be and again, this lack of clarity by itself gives weight to the Moderate case as far as market sentiment is concerned. Secondly, Alibaba is not the only Chinese multinational company that can continue to increase China's soft power projection. Tencent is a peer to Alibaba in terms of market capitalization and international influence and don't forget there are many other smaller companies waiting in the wings. As such, it's unlikely that market sentiment will veer towards the Mild case over the Moderate case.

Finally, the market doesn't believe in the Severe case. VIEs have been significantly beneficial to the CCP in terms of foreign direct investments and soft power projection. Banning VIEs will destroy the CCP's credibility and hurt international investments in China for years to come.

# The BABA action plan

BABA is a sell in the short term until the uncertainty begins to clear. Institutional investors will be trimming their positions and selling as soon as they can. Although there will be a segment of retail investors trying to catch a falling knife, their buying volume will be dwarfed by the rest of the market's selling. In addition, BABA's fall coincides with the year-end tax-loss harvesting period where investors sell underperforming assets to reduce the next year's tax burden which is even more impetus for selling. In terms of price action, BABA will probably consolidate after the massive drop overnight. There will be a short term relief bounce during this consolidation so selling the top of this bounce is ideal. After consolidation, if the situation doesn't change, it'll form a descending price channel to a prior support level (e.g. $200).

In the long term, I believe that BABA will do well and long positions should be established the moment clarity starts to form and BABA has consolidated at a lower support. I personally believe that the CCP isn't interested in significantly hurting Alibaba and is really targeting Jack Ma. Given that Jack Ma has given up the reigns of the company, the CCP has little to gain from inflicting more than surface wounds on Alibaba. As always, personal beliefs should be separated from overall market sentiment.

If you can dip in at ipo pricing, this one is definitely going to be free tendies and you will hate yourself for sleeping on it. For those who cant participate in the ipo, you might want to look at Big Fu\*king Tendies which is going to merge with Paysafe and ill be posting a DD on that very soon so stay tuned. 

Buckle up my fellow retards cause today were going to be talking about Affirm IPO and how its about to bring us tendies through our weaponized autism. The company focuses on “buy now pay later” market along with other financial services. Affirm **demonstrates serious potential with solid 98% yoy growth with narrowing losses** and **a disruptive business model that creates a mutual win-win situation between the merchants and the customers** by undercutting the traditional financing cost and bringing more sales to merchants. With the **recent acquisition of PayBright, a Canadian buy now pay later provider, Affirm is looking to expand aggressively and to increase market domination in the sector by increasing the targeted region, larger and more diverse merchant network and reach to more users**. Affirm is set to gain 7000 merchants and thereby increasing the reach to more potential long-term customers. Affirm is also looking for more expansion via **deep integration partnership with shopify to power shop pay installments. (shopify actually owns 5% of affirm)**

What is Affirm?

Affirm is a latest fintech company that mainly focuses on the “buy now pay later” market while providing various other services such as saving account and virtual card. The goal of the Affirm is to be as ubiquitous, secure and convenient as legacy networks, yet far more transparent, honest and both consumer and merchant centric. Affirm currently **has more than 6.2M+ consumers, 6500+ merchants, a 64% consumer retention rate, 100% merchant retention rate and a Gross Merchandise value of 10.7Bil since 2017 with a whopping 77% growth from 2.6bil to 4.6bil from 2019 to 2020.** With the traditional credit and debit cards are designed to butt plug and milk the crap out of consumers as consumers paid approximately $121 billion in credit card interest, $11 billion on overdraft fees and $3billion in late fees and does very little to assist merchants to overcome the two biggest challenges; the cost of acquire a customer and the cost to convert a sale. **With Affirm, consumers benefit from having access to 0% APR financing or a financing plan that is more affordable and more transparent than the credit card rate and little to no penalties to late payments. The merchants benefit from having more customers and better conversion due to the lower rate. Under partnerships with Affirm, dollar-based merchants’ retention has consistently exceeded 100% for each cohort of merchants that joined and merchants also reported 92% and 85% higher average order value in 2018 and 2019.** 

**Service Provided**

**1)** **Buy now pay later (with special financing options from partnered merchants)**

**2)** **Virtual card (works just like credit and debit account which grants you the buy now pay later option to any non-participated merchants)**

**3)** **High interest saving account** 

**The revenue source of Affirm is built upon**

**1)**  **Merchant fees with larger merchant fees on 0% APR financing products (0% APR financing represents 43% and 46%)**

**2)** **Interest income on simple interest loans from originating bank partners of consumer purchases** 

**3)** **Portion of the interchange fee from the transaction through virtual card which provides flexibility and essentially cheap credits to users by allowing customers to shop with merchants that may not yet be fully integrated with Affirm** 

Future Projection:

With the dying retail stores and rapid adaption of e-commerce from Gen Z and Millennials, global online sales grew 20% to approximately $3.4 trillion in 2019 and is expected to grow to approximately $5.8 trillion by 2023. As more and more people moving purchase online on top of the pandemics we are facing today, e-commerce has become one of the most rapid growth markets in the past few years **with the “buy now pay later” being the fast fastest growing e-commerce payment method globally. In North America, “buy now pay later: market share is expected to triple 3% of the e commerce payments market by 2023 and with other regions already accounts for 6% of the e commerce payment market and is expected to soar to almost 10% by 2023. With the acquisition of paybright which provides affirm access to 7000+ more merchants and the deep integration with shopify, expect affirm to do be a money printing machine down the road.**

**Overall, banking on the poor via cheap and accessible credits in general is an economic concept that has been tested over and over again in various countries to be extremely profitable and beneficial to the overall economic. With cheap and accessible credits, one could also expect higher demand for products with higher price tags. It is no surprise that most partnered luxury brands offer 0% APR financing options and one should expect to see more partnerships with luxury brands coming soon. As a result, expect this shit to do very well in the future.**

&#x200B;

Potential downside?

On the SEC filing, they have listed that the peloton sales currently make up about 28% of the revenue. At the first glance, it may seem like a really bad news, however, such could also be interpreted as a working business model doing what its intended to do as stated above. In the case of Peloton, it shows that with the access to cheap credits, people are more willing to make big purchases and merchants could benefit tremendously from the increase in demand from it. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Shit gonna moon. 100% yoy growth and narrowing net loss. Expanding aggressively with shopify to leverage on. FK BOOMER BANKS.",2020-12-12 22:31:30
A Meme Stock…But Also Fundamentally Solid: APXT,0.95,"My fellow delinquents, I present to you the fundamental case for a meme stock that’s been floated around this sub: APXT

What does it mean to have good fundamentals? It means that in addition to this stock getting lumped into the meme category and generating ridiculously fat tendies in the near-term, there’s also a sense of comfort from the downside protection (a foreign concept to many of us) the fundamentals of the company provide. As you’ll see below, at its current valuation, there is significant runway for APXT to go up on pure fundamentals that you can quantify and comfortably defend, and not purely on speculative hype that a lot of these other meme stocks seem to be propped up on.

Since a lot of other posts in this sub cover what the company does, I’ll be brief. APXT is a SPAC to bring the company AvePoint public. AvePoint is a SaaS data management company that basically provides security offerings and solutions to “plug holes” associated with data transfer within the Microsoft Office cloud solutions. In other words, they help migrate, manage, and protect data in Microsoft 365. You can definitely read more in other threads, I think they do a good job with the qualitative stuff. The main takeaway is that it’s a legit business that has many diversified blue-chip customers and operates in an industry with strong tailwinds. Now, onto the good stuff.

The hardest part of any investment is not determining whether a company is good or bad, it’s “is it worth the price?” Once the qualitative checkboxes are checked off (e.g., this company isn’t committing fraud, it’s not losing to competition, isn’t levered to the tits with debt, etc.), which they are for APXT, investors typically look at a few metrics for these software businesses to determine the appropriate valuation. These are TAM (Total Addressable Market), growth, recurring revenue, profitability, and churn, among others.

**APXT TAM**: $33 billion (represents if all potential customers bought all available your products)

**APXT Revenue Growth**: 25% per year (30% on a recurring revenue basis)

**APXT Recurring Revenue**: \~78% of total revenue (2020); this represents subscription revenue that customers contractually pay year over year (e.g., spotify charges on a subscription based model while video games that you buy once are changed on a license/one-time revenue model)

**APXT Profitability**: 14% EBIT margin (% of revenue that is kept as profits before the impact of interest expense (which there are none) and taxes)

**APXT Churn**: N/A unfortunately

**APXT Balance Sheet**: Looks clean – no debt, $252M of cash

Based on all these metrics, you get a pretty complete financial profile for the business that you can compare to other publicly traded peers to triangulate around an appropriate valuation. Here is a sample of other high growth SaaS companies:

https://preview.redd.it/lcz1w3bu8n461.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbd0d103fb750a4eaacc97323d108b31a2085466

As you can see, APXT fits into this comp set quite well in terms of growth, profitability, TAM, and recurring revenue, though it is somewhat smaller in terms of revenue. But what about price? The everyday analogous way to think about price or valuation is shopping for clothes (or anything, really). Of course a custom tailored Italian suit complemented with Gucci loafers is going to be a much doper outfit than an oversized white Old Navy t-shirt complemented with oversized jhorts you got from Goodwill, but it also is going to cost you 1000x as much. Same principle applies to company valuations. Unfortunately there are no price tags on stocks – it’s a bit more complicated than just comparing straight up stock prices. You have to look at the stock price (x) the number of outstanding shares, which gets you the market cap, or the equity value. Then you have to add net debt (total debt minus cash). This resulting sum is called the company’s enterprise value (EV) and represents the worth of the entire company. For companies like these that have strong growth and no profits, the appropriate comparison to make is against each company’s EV divided by its Revenue. This represents the value of the entire company (based on the stock price) relative to its revenue, a fundamental metric. Companies with similar profiles in terms of growth, recurring revenue, etc. should have similar multiples. Going back to the previous clothing example, the suit + Gucci sleds are much better than the Big and Tall sloppy seconds, but once you normalize for the price (e.g., looking at the price divided by fundamental metric like quality of clothing), the relative advantage of the suit becomes much more muted. If the suit was just as cheap as the t-shirt and jhorts, then you’d obviously buy the former, because the price / fundamental metrics ratio is much lower. Same concept here with APXT. Let’s look at the same table above, except now with the EV / Revenue multiples

https://preview.redd.it/1zpgx0qx8n461.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e6419e322dbfdb5a90d71ce905c781761ed798c

As you can see, APXT has strong fundamental stats, and is relatively cheap (at 17.4x vs average of 20.8x), suggesting it is a good buy.

For those who say these companies aren’t comparable on the basis of size – I completely hear you. All the comps listed here are bigger than APXT despite sharing otherwise similar characteristics. Okta and Ping both operate in security and the last 3 companies are direct companies APXT mentions in their investor presentation as having comparable profitability and growth above a certain size metric. For what it’s worth, I’ve done separate analyses showing that size isn’t a strong predictor of valuation (it’s more so growth and other fundamental metrics).

To summarize, at $14.33 a share (closing price at 12/11/20), the company is worth \~$2.6B EV, representing a \~17.4x EV / Revenue multiple. For a SaaS company growing at 25% in a large market benefiting from strong tailwinds that has already achieved profitability, this multiple is somewhat conservative (read: low), and I can see it going much higher given the current market environment. Two years ago, I would never have dreamed of calling a company trading at 17x Revenue conservative, but times change and in the era of companies like DoorDash IPOing for absurd valuations (27x revenue), it’s certainly not unfathomable for a company like this to trade up to 25x, which translates to \~$19/share, representing a 33% upside from where it’s trading at today.

"Basic Small Money Plays For a This Wild and Crazy Market - IPO's, SPAC's, and New Tech; Oh My!",0.63,"**One big thing stands out to me in the ""recent"" market** that seems like an old concept being pushed hard again\*\*:\*\*

**Some new IPO's/SPAC's, or** just **companies** that have been **under the radar** and already passed over for what appeared to be better long term investments, **are going for modern or interesting sounding names and tickers**, that may intended **to boost interest in younger investors.**

**LISTEN HERE:**

**THIS IS SO OBVIOUS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY, NO SHIT SHERLOCK, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.**

**SO DO IT THIS TIME, IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY! BUY BEFORE THE MEME GETS SOMEONE RICH THAT'S NOT YOU!**

The **new tickers that move** are ones that **have things that make them sound cool,** and **that's** really **all that matters.** Usually the **name is catchy,** the **ticker is** often **easy to remember and** might even look like it should go that Porsche **you're going to** buy when it's **finally** your turn to **get** rich and post gain **porn.**

**LOOK: These tickers don't require as much fundamental quantification**, compared to some REIT named $LAME buying up closed down dollar general store locations, or something equally boring to talk about. It's all about marketing and perception.

**THE GAMBLE:** What **I suggest** is going **long** on **shares** when you see these particular types of stocks hit the market, especially if you're hearing people asking about them a lot, because if people are interested in crap only because the ticker, product, or company name sounds cool, you may have a winner.

**Typically,** **you want to see if there's a little dip first. If you're already in, this is not the time to sell and try to time re-entry.**  **Some IPO's don't allow shorting for a certain duration,** but that doesn't mean price cannot drop initially. Also, **not all IPO's will run options until a certain number of days have passed,** and there may be some wait before hype is prepared to move the stock, **so watch the option volume very closely and see if it begins to look liquid.** Take this time to consider if the stock will have some sort level of excitement in it, and attract attention. It should sound cool. Honestly, **it should be something that you might not buy yourself, but** you'd definitely **want to try it out or learn more about what the heck this** ticker **thing is** trying to sell if you weren't so lazy and it was free.

We have seen things with **names like LAZR** recently, **pumped by Cramer**, with ooooooo, maybe a military contract, and ahhhh, cool cameras that can probably spot people really far away.

**RKT**, because it even if it has reasonable fundamentals, you know it had to go up for a bit, **because it's named rocket...**

**NIO, PLUG, LI, FCEL, FLIR, PLTR** (I haven't even read the Lord of the Rings series and I know the reference), **TSLA, NKLA, ZooM**, and so forth. **Many** of these companies **doubled, trippled, or** went up even **more,** in very short periods.

Now, **some of those companies** have some value, and some do not, or certainly **not worth** what **their local maxima** will become, so you want to **get in cheap and early as hype begins,** but ***before any major price move***, **and then just wait for the gains and GTFO of the stock unless it's run by some incredibly weird entrapreneur that gets regular interviews on any damn show he wants.** So much of the market is over bought, that people will buy any piece of crap that sounds cool. That's it. That's all you need to know.

**First, I suggest getting the WeBull app**. A lot of people have it, whether that's their broker or not, because it does a few things right, but **mainly it's a convenient way to find out what IPO's may be coming up**. **RKT, PLTR, and many others were announced well in advance via WeBull,** and **if you have notifications on** for it\*\*, you'll get the ""memo""\*\* that some of retail is getting. Now **don't go buying every IPO.** You want to **look for a** **product that sounds like it has future potential**, something **not fully tapped into yet,** and the **company name must grab your attention**. You want **a name that sounds exciting and fast paced** to retail. Something that **if you said it at the dinner table,** or around friends, **would the name make people seem honestly interested?**

I have been sitting through this bull run, selling positions early, not going in on the companies I mentioned, using rational reasoning for why to buy a stock. This is not the time for being completely rational. Your investment accounts should be Boglerific, but **your play money needs to find a home in these types of stocks**, **take the large gain when it comes, and dump** the stock **before everyone else** does.

Buy long duration vertical calls if they're available, but **don't plan to hold longer than whenever the spike comes.** **Vertical spreads help reduce IV cost somewhat** (usually) as the two strikes will partially cancel out each others vega, so this lets you get in with a defined risk amount. Shares are still the safer way, as puts will likely be not liquid enough at first to sell bull put verticals, and IPO's like this are more likely to tripple in the first 6 months than they are to become 1/3rd.

**THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE, AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A STRATEGY MOSTLY FOR AN OVERBOUGHT MARKET WITH LITTLE ELSE TO PICK FROM.**

FREE MONEY ALERT: Salesforce ($CRM) 12/31 250C,0.93,"Note: Buying my positions at open in the morning cause I’m not retarted 

I’m going to start giving you all free money alerts. 

Called BABA at 255 a few weeks back, and PLUG at the end of October. I know the sub-species of idiots who exist on this sub need to earn some money to later lose on OTM calls for high-risk small cap companies that are at all time highs. I’m here to provide. 

There is no better purchase then Saleforce tomorrow, we are below all moving short &amp; long averages, and we of course have had another unprecedented crash on amazing news. Providing a wonderful opportunity for you idiots to buy in at an absolute low, when the company will be at all time highs within the next two months. 

I know some dumb cunts are going to be like “well their future outlook isn’t looking as good as we wanted” I’m here to tell you that when stocks have been crashing like Paul Walker after beating expectations for no reason, what do you do as a CEO and CFO to attempt to avoid this? You set the bar super fucking LOW to make sure your investors are nothing but happy and stop reducing your companies value by 10% every quarter. It’s like none of you have ever read a book on financial relations or PR.. Oh wait... 

Buy the stock or by calls, whatever you want to do, Saleforce will absolutely make you money this month. Merry Christmas assholes.

EDIT: Well boys and girls if you got in early this morning; Christmas came fucking early.

EDIT 2: Position adjustment: Day traded 12/31 250C for roughly 50% gain. Due to larger sell off then anticipated adjusted the Strike to 12/31 240C. 

There also seems to be a misconception about what I expect to gain from these contracts, and I need to make sure that everyone understands I do not chase 4000% gains. I’m not betting on CRM going to 300 by the end of December. 

When it comes to making money with bullish OTM positions the question is simple: Will the stock price rise enough, and at a high enough ROC (Average ROC presented with IV) to overcome the loss of speculative value, or Theta from its current position? When I release free money alerts I’m telling you that within the expiration date this will occur. Whether you want to hold and hope that it continues is fully up to you. In other words I’m happy to tell you what to buy, but I won’t tell you when to take profit. 

In other words people, don’t get greedy and bag-hold your fucking calls over the next month if you have OTM’s. Take advantage of the oversell on the bounce back and get out. You don’t buy OTM hoping for real value by the time they expire you buy them to sell on the one big day it bounces back.",2020-12-02 02:37:43
What I learned from half year of investing (and trading),0.94,"Sup retards, I am writing this to share what I learned in my small time of investing and trading till now. Of course there are a lot of retards here who are less retarded than I am, and so know more about investing than I do. This is partly to keep a note to myself (and make it public), so I don't repeat the same mistakes again. And partly to give some pointers to those here who are more retarded than me.

TL;DR: Stonks don't always go up. Get your emotions in line, especially jealousy of people posting their 1000+% gain porn. pre-market is a bitch. do your DD and don't just buy highly upvoted tickers. good money can be made in safer plays as well (like buying Shopify when it dropped to 900 due to vaccine news.). PLTR & NIO TO THE MOON.

1. This is something you would already know. There are a lot of people here posting 1000+% gains in a few weeks/months. But there are a lot lot more than that who are not making that, and in fact losing. I know you know that as well. So don't fucking get jealous and play stupid gambles (like buying fucking nikola at fucking 79$). You are already a retard, you already have a disadvantage compared to those outside. Don't let your emotions get the better of you as well.
2. Pre-market is fucked up. Never buy a gamble stock just by seeing high pre-market rise. You will almost always lose. 
3. You're new to WSB, you are seeing people posting a lot of tickers that are going to be the next NIO or the next PLUG. Don't go buying all those ticker. When someone posts a DD, don't just scroll down and comment 'All I read was buy' and buy the stock. Do your own DD.
4. (This may not apply to all) Try to limit the number of stocks you're holding to a minimum. Diversification is good but make sure you're not going overboard (like having only 2000$ to invest/trade and buying 40 tickers with that). Even if all those 40 stocks are hot growth stocks, you're not gonna make a lot of money because a lot of them WILL go down. Buy the stocks in which you feel confident that they will go up in some time. Don't buy something just because it has been going up a lot and everyone is saying it'll go up.
5.  Hold what you've bought for some time if you believe in the stocks short term/ long term capability. Don't sell it as soon as you're down some 5-10%. If you do that you'll just be buying high selling low all the stocks. As a personal example: I really believe in Unity's business and capability. I bought unity at 95, but got scared when it fell down to 86, then, as soon as it hit 95 again I sold. I was stupid, Now unity is 150. Believe in yourself more than some random retards on WSB.
6. I have made more money when hyped stock fall, compared to when hyped stocks rise. Invest in what seems safer (and can give good returns as well). For ex. when pfizer vaccine news came out, Shopify and Zoom fell like crazy. Even though I feel Zoom stock valuation is sooooo fucking stupid, I bought the dip and sold both the stocks just yesterday for about 20-30% gains on both. - This is really subjective, but I like this more compared to investing in PLTR at 30 or NIO at 50 (By the way I have positions in both of them and am about 100% up on both, so PLTR, NIO to moon). Remember that losses are also big in high growth stocks just like gains.
7. Keep a fucking target of how much return youre looking for. Dont get distracted by posts every day on WSB posting their 1000+% returns. You need 25-30% return a year to get rich eventually (this is just my personal target). Have a separate account for trading where you've trying to get crazy gains (and actually getting crazy losses), and keep the amount in that account minimum.

I know all this is just a repeat of some obvious things everyone says and my post may just get removed. Who cares.

Another thing: my experience here is just from stocks and not from options. I am from India and it is illegal for us to trade options in US market. 

Finally, even though everyone in WSB is a retarded autist and they just jack off to their gains and other's losses. I've learned a lot from posts in this sub. And this is also a really good sub for discovering stocks to do DD on. Many other positives of WSB, just not mentioning them here.

Happy trading/investing.",2020-12-01 12:39:24
10 Brown tips for WSB Newbies,0.89,"Reading   through some of the posts I can see how some of you think so highly of yourselves that a single red day in a rocket ship stock market makes you feel like you're the next Warren Burry. Post after post  of losers making huge returns.  Everyone is getting rich but you.  Boofuckinghoo. The smart investor  realizes it’s all an elaborate side  stepping of online casino laws. Some of it works, most of it doesn’t. To be successful, you need to be able to recognize the difference and to  do that, you need hype, lots of money, and a cushy day job to fall back  on when you blow up your life savings on a YOLO.

Here are ten tips that can help you along the way.

**Tip 1 - You don’t know shit**

But that's fine, because nobody else does either.

**Tip 2 - Understand how tendies flow in the market**

Tendies flow to those bold enough to earn them. If volatile stocks and speculative ""investing"" scare you, go to [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) and park your money in an ETF.

**Tip 3 - Play for the short term**

The   most important rule you need to follow religiously is ALL COMPANIES  WILL EVENTUALLY GO OUT OF BUSINESS. If you look at the makeup of the  market from 1995 to now, you'll notice a glaring trend: 90% of companies  that were at the peak of the market then are now dust. You may get  lucky and pick a long term winner here and there, but understand that  hype is a bitch, there's always a bigger fish, and nothing lasts  forever. If you're not planning your bets with well defined entry and  exit points, you will end up diamond handing some losing play way too  long because your confirmation bias has convinced you that you found the  next Amazon in a sea of [pets.com](https://pets.com/)  stocks from a DD post on a forum that is self described as ""if 4chan  found a bloomberg terminal"". Picking individual stocks is for short term  gains. Park your money in an ETF or index fund if you want something  long term with an OK rate of return.

**Tip 4 - Time is not on your side (if you're yolo'ing options)**

Theta  gang always wins. They don't always win as big as others win, but they  always win. If you're trading short term options and you're not the one  benefiting from theta, don't be so greedy that you lose your profits to  theta decay and market volatility. A stock could end on a Friday just  barely OTM and ruin your account just to run up 20% the following Monday.

**Tip 5 - Paper Trading**

Paper  trading is a simulation. It behaves exactly like a real account with  real active data but it’s all practice. DO THIS FOR ZERO SECONDS. Paper  trading to prepare for real trading is like a boxer only training for a  fight by hitting the heavy bag. It will help some, but it's nothing like  a real fight. Every person who says ""oh if only i had bought Apple 20 years ago I'd be a billionaire"" has never actually traded  anything risky because everyone who has knows that it's stupid to stare  at a 100% return or even a 20% return and not lock it in.

**Tip 6 - Understand taxes**

Plug that stuff in to turbotax and let the nerds figure this out for you.  Just remember that after each trade you make that actually earns money,  set aside some for Uncle Sam. But google ""wash sale"" if you get bored  between staring at futures and reading ""DD"" posts about chinese EV  startups.

**Tip 7 - No one knows shit**

You don't know shit. I don't know shit. Nobody knows shit. Why are you reading this?

**Tip 8 - Learn to read fundamentals and understand valuations**

Lol jk. If you're reading about company fundamentals, go park your  money in an index fund or ETF. Refer to tips 1, 3, and 7 for why this is  the right move.

**Tip 9 - Get rich schemes are for winners**

Refer  to tip 8. You're not here to try to guess which company will be the  next Amazon by 2050. You're hear to scalp sick gains and retire early.  If you're not shooting for at least a 3-5% monthly growth in your  portfolio, skip the hassle and park your money in an ETF or index fund.

**Tip 10 - Discipline and dedication**

Like   anything in life, to be successful you have to fucking work at it and  be incredibly lucky in being at the right place and right time. Be  disciplined in your entry and exit points for each play, but don't over  think shit.

\--

For   those of you this resonates with, I look forward to seeing the loss  porn on the next red market day. Do the  work. For those of you  who love chasing the fantasy of actually knowing what you're  doing, good luck, I  mean it. It’s a tough fucking pill to swallow  realizing that you're not some investing prodigy and that your hundreds  of hours of ""DD"" will woefully underperform the mouth breathers who hit a  couple of lucky plays and never have to work again in their lives.

A case for holding...,0.89,"
Tl;dr: Invest a little in several promising stocks and sectors, and hold through the dips. 

Just posting this since I can’t go back in time to tell myself, but maybe my experiences will help out some other noobs who only have time to trade as a side-hustle. I really have no idea of what I’m doing, so take this post with a grain of salt... However, if you see something wrong with my strategy, feel free to tear it apart! 

I’ve traded off and on since May with okay results—40% gains overall. However, my account dipped below $25k this morning so I couldn’t sell my FOMO shares without being marked as a pattern day trader, so I’ve just been watching my account go down further and further...and then start to go back up... I was down about $1000 and as of now I’m back in the green +$400 or so... 

A blessing in disguise? Maybe. Given that I couldn’t sell when I wanted to, I was forced to hold and I’m glad I did. This led me to evaluate some of the stocks I bought back in July that made a decent profit, dipped triggering me to panic sell after losing most of the gains, only to buy back in later at a higher price. Interestingly, if I would have held these stocks through the dips, my profits would have been well over the measly 40%—im talking 300% or more. 

For example, if I would have held onto the 4 TSLA shares I bought for $995 (pre-split), I’d have 20 shares now worth about 4x what I paid. Similar story with PLUG, BLNK, LAC, APHA and FCEL. My initial investment of $25k*would be worth over $100k had I forgot I invested, and it would have saved countless hours of stress and anxiety. *note: it’s under $25k now because I’ve been using profits to remodel my house. 

That said, I’m going to try this hold and see approach starting tomorrow. Tomorrow I’ll clear out my FOMO stocks and maintain a dozen or so promising positions that I believe are set to boom over the next year or so—primarily anything having to do with EV, renewable energy and marijuana. Limiting myself to just ~$2k initial investments in each stock should limit the risk (unless everything tanks long term, which I think is unlikely). I’ll then try to only check my account every two weeks. Not as sexy as day trading, but it might make sense for folks like me who work fulltime. 

So far I’m thinking:
[TSLA, duh]
[LAC, up and coming lithium mine near Tesla’s NV battery factory]
[PLUG, charging stations]
[BLNK, charging stations]
[FCEL, alternative energy]
[HEXO, marijuana]
[APHA, marijuana]
[NOVA, solar]
[RUN, solar]
[And a variety of ARK_ ETFs. ]

Any thoughts?? Am I missing anything? Any of these seem like a bad bet? 

Wish me luck!",2020-11-30 19:50:40

PLUG POWER RAISES APPROXIMATELY $1B TO ACCELERATE THE FIRST NATION-WIDE GREEN HYDROGEN NETWORK
11/24/20
Download this Press ReleasePDF Format (opens in new window)
LATHAM, N.Y., Nov. 24, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ: PLUG), a leading provider of hydrogen engines and fueling solutions enabling e-mobility, has successfully completed one of the largest bought equity deal transactions in the broader clean-tech sector. This marks Plug Power’s largest capital raise in the Company’s history with approximately $1 billion of capital, bringing total cash post-closing balance to $1.7 billion. The capital raise uniquely positions Plug Power to execute and accelerate on its green hydrogen strategy as well as other strategic growth initiatives.
Plug Power recently announced its plans to build five regional green hydrogen facilities in the United States. The Company will continue to work with strategic partners, including Apex Clean Energy and Brookfield Renewable, to source low-cost renewable power. The combination of low-cost renewables, strong capital position, and in house electrolyzer and liquefaction technology all uniquely position Plug Power to build out this green hydrogen network. Furthermore, Plug Power has already become the largest user of liquid hydrogen with its internal demand increasing from current 40TPD (tons per day), to 100TPD by 2024.The first two green hydrogen plants are expected to be operational in 2022. All five plants are expected to be operational by 2024, with a total capacity of 100TPD. This would constitute the country's first nationwide green hydrogen network. The green hydrogen generated by this network will support the mission to decarbonize the broader transportation and logistics industries, a mission shared by both Plug Power and its customers. The Company's unmatched industry position as a total solutions provider will also help facilitate the anticipated rapid growth of the hydrogen economy. According to consultancy McKinsey & Company, the global hydrogen economy could reach $2.5 trillion by 2050, representing 18% of the global energy demand.“We are very pleased with the reception from the institutional investors and the market resulting in a meaningfully upsized capital raise. This ideally positions Plug Power to accelerate the growth of the green hydrogen economy in the United States and globally, a job we wholeheartedly accept,” said Andy Marsh, CEO of Plug Power. “Green hydrogen provides one of the lowest carbon emission solutions from a wells-to-wheels perspective serving a variety of different industries.”“We have identified several locations working with strategic partners where we can produce green hydrogen at parity with grey hydrogen and see further opportunities to reduce the cost of green hydrogen. Furthermore, this recently completed capital raise and in house capabilities ideally positions us to accelerate the build out of this green hydrogen network,” said Sanjay Shrestha, Chief Strategy Officer and head of Plug Power’s green hydrogen generation business.

LGVW in a deal with an enterprise value of $1.5 billion. The combined company will list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker ""BFLY."" It will have about $584 million in cash to develop its digital imaging technology.

Butterfly iQ is an ultrasound transducer that can perform ""whole body imaging' with a single handheld probe using chip technology that connects to a mobile phone or tablet, the companies said in a statement.

Butterfly's early investors include Baillie Gifford, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Fosun Industrial Co., Limited. Butterfly's aim is to make superior medical imaging at more affordable prices. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021.

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/medical-imaging-provider-butterfly-network-to-merge-with-spac-longview-in-15-billion-deal-2020-11-20

As of yesterday Ark Funds bought close to 450k shares. I looked up the technology, it looks very exciting. For my research, I found out that an ultrasound machine can cost 500k for a hospital. This hand held device that can plug into an iPhone cost about 2k with a subscription . I don’t expect hospitals to replace their ultrasound machines anytime soon, however, I can see remote usage for this where with AI infusion, you can take your own ultrasound and send it to an on-call Radiologist via video conference call. More importantly, this is will be very useful for emerging countries that can’t afford a 500k ultrasound machine for their hospital.

This is their competitor’s products and how Butterfly compares.

TL/DR: Butterfly network will merge with $LGVW. Butterfly network provides iphone ultrasound for  less than 2k with of subscription. (ultrasound machines is around ~500k). Think of massive growth for worldwide since poor countries s can’t afford half a million dollar ultrasound machines.

Why FCEL is going to $18-20,0.76,"So FCEL has been going up a lot lately, and everyone's probably thinking ""They're done"". But no, theyre nowhere near done. They've got a market cap of 2.5B as it stands, but similar companies like PLUG have market caps in the 5B range. Electric fuel cells are great and all, but they don't compare to hydrogen fuel cells. These hydrogen fuel cells have become safer than your granny's stairs, and given a few years, hydrogen will be the way to go, over electric, any day of the week. Also, theoretically, hydrogen would be a perfect fuel source for bigger vehicles, like ships, and planes, due to the high kilogram calorific value of Hydrogen. Planes run off Kerosene, Ships off Engine Oil, and as oil prices continue to rise, they're gonna need more viable solutions, hydrogen fuel cells could be one of these.

The Curious Case for Clean Energy,0.84,"So we've all seen what weaponized autism can do to stocks like NIO and Tesla and I'm here to say things are just getting started. The emergence of PLUG and FCEL should be great indicators of the appetite for this sector. Electric energy is the basis for our technology-driven society and with all the blame for pollution landing on FF corps clean energy is the answer (Exxon used to be one of the most valuable companies pre2010 after all). 

So what should you invest in? My argument is not NIO and Tesla. Wait what, that's heresy?! Steady now and hear me out. That's like the equivalent of buying a Ford or GM and subject to tastes, availability, competition, and functionality. I don't know if you've seen recent news on Ford or GM but they are going to bring the heat really soon to these only EV companies. Ford and GM will literally flood the market with availability and the mass production will be extremely difficult for these fresh companies to compete with. The legacy car companies will transform into tech companies with rivaling battery and AI tech. Arguably not as good for maybe a decade but they will throw enough money at the problem to make themselves competitive before 2025. 

So Ford and GM calls then right? Well, I've made out well doing so but that's still a long value-driven play in my opinion. Not to mention all the boomers in these companies that pullout after pennies of profits and stupid amounts of volume makes it rather difficult to move the stocks in meaningful capacities when most make out better in NIO and Tesla. I'd recommend IDRV if you'd like complete exposure to the likes of Tesla, Nio, Ford, GM, and NVDA. But it's still not what the biggest boom in the room over the next 5 years.

Invest in TAN, ICLN, and QCLN. ALL equally good and still undervalued. How are they undervalued after +100% gains since March lows. Well, that's because the true weaponize autist hasn't hit them yet. Who is this Max level autist? It's none other than the US Federal Reserve. I'm not guaranteeing the Green New Deal but you'd be a retard to not see the trend that's happening. A literal energy and power renaissance from FF to Renewables. Governments worldwide are banning non-EV car sales past 2030, pulling funding from gas and oil projects everywhere, banning single-use plastics, and removing the subsidies that are floating FF in the markets currently. Politicians aren't dumb and they follow the money as well and won't be receiving the same level of corrupt payments they have been when the petrodollar was king. Biden will make renewables into the new energy giants and absolutely ass blast the entire sector with a literal money cannon that will force profitability for all involved. So don't invest in just one company that gets a piece of the pie. Invest in the sector with the ICLN, QCLN, and TAN that get the whole pie! Well, the Senate won't let them do that. Mind you over 60% of Repubs are for renewables, and many of them are aware that their reelections could hinge on their decisions on this matter. The Dems literally only need to flip less than a hand full of them to get it done. Big banks are also front running and funding a ton of clean energy projects and stocks while refusing to fund FF anymore. Electricity is the currency, fuel, information, and fun of the future. The time has come to get free energy from the sun, who's with me!

TLDR: buy clean energy etf calls

Trying to find the next meme. Liquified Nat Gas and engines for alt energy vehicles,0.75,"Long discussion ahead. Skip to bottom for positions. Buy WPRT Calls.

TL;DR is that I think this has potential to become a meme soon.

By EOD I bailed on everything I had in EVs/FCEL/PLUG, aside from my Nio shares. Maybe I dipped out too early, but I think the EVs and likes of PLUG/FCEL are gonna be difficult to navigate now that the initial hysteria could be dying off. both FCEL and PLUG closed below the highs they hit on Thursday, but who knows, market gonna market. Anyway.

I don't think we're done with alternative energy and tech. What I like now are alternative fuel sources for cars - namely liquified, renewable, and compressed natural gas. Some of this shit is even made from waste products and I'm told it's a cleaner alternative to regular old fuel. The best part is, there are some actual sales and usage of this already. I like the market to transition to alt energy that is a little more profitable in the short-term, as they've been dumping a ton of money into companies that have little or zero revenue. We either go full retard into EVs and hydrogen or we see a short pull back.

Right now the US only has like 200k of these vehicles max, mainly trucks, buses, and other heavy vehicles. Plenty of room for growth. China has 5 million, but I don't know of the companies who did it there. The most glaring problem is that this technology has already been tried and failed, but this redemption story is playing out now in the hydrogen sector with PLUG/FCEL. The U.S. made a huge push for this back in 2008 and the two stocks I'll be talking about hit their ATH in 2012 (WPRT $45 and CLNE $28). Currently they're sitting at $3.50ish a share.

However, I believe we see a renewed interest now with Biden in office and this hype for greener energy solutions. This shit is something we have available now and can start using today until things like hydrogen and EVs become the norm. It's ideal for the transition and we do need realistic and practical solutions for right now, until newer tech gets where it needs to be.

WPRT is my favorite of the two. They make the engines and components for vehicles using natural gas and hydrogen. They're under Cummins (CMI), which has proven to be an outstanding company. WPRT has doubled in the last 2 weeks, up 12% Friday on good, but not insane volume.

CLNE is a pure play on liquified/compressed/renewable natural gas and fueling stations. The stock is up 40% in the last 2 weeks. Up almost 9% Friday on good volume. I think WPRT is the true play, as their financials look better and have ties to Cummins. Not to mention they are involved with both nat gas and hydrogen.

Both stocks are still under the radar and have had mooning days, but also flat days and red days, so they're far from meme status. They closed near their daily highs, while many stocks faded. Someone is buying this shit. I see huge potential here, but it could easily fizzle out without some kind of news in the form of increased government backing or new contracts from a huge companies.

**Positions: WPRT $3 calls 12/18, WPRT $4 calls 01/15 (66%)**

Trump (Through Mnuchin) Is Trying To Turn Off The Printers And CRash Stonks- Start Hedging Now!,0.81,"Here's the article:

[https://thehill.com/policy/finance/526785-mnuchin-asks-fed-to-return-455-billion-in-unspent-covid-emergency-funds](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/526785-mnuchin-asks-fed-to-return-455-billion-in-unspent-covid-emergency-funds)

&#x200B;

Judging by the title itself it doesn't seem like a big deal, after all, its only $455bil but I'm gonna break it down for you people as to why you should start to SERIOUSLY consider buying UVXY calls or SPY puts (I know, super gay). 

Since the start of the pandemic, one of the key programs set up by the FED is its key lending facilities. These facilities were set up to cover virtually ALL aspects of the credit markets from corporate debt to credit cards. Pretty much any debt that can be securitized, these facilities were set up so that the FED (through their SPVs) can purchase these CDOs or ETFs and provide liquidity to the credit markets and raise investor confidence. Now, the only way the FED can continue to purchase these debt assets is if the Treasury continues to support the FED by providing funds to cover any potential losses the facilities may incur ([https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2020/09/federal-reserve-lending-facilities-what-are-they-how-are-they-funded-and-how-will-they-support-the-economy-during-the-coronavirus](https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2020/09/federal-reserve-lending-facilities-what-are-they-how-are-they-funded-and-how-will-they-support-the-economy-during-the-coronavirus)). The amount of money the Treasury can provide is stated in the CARES act and is $455billion dollars, the same amount as stated in the title.

Right now, Mnuchin is pulling that amount from the FED and is therefore refusing to extend the lending facilities past year end, which means the market now knows that the backstop they enjoyed from the FED since March is running out and the confidence they had that the FED will support virtually all corners of the credit market is now shattered. Even if Mnuchin only wants to pull the plug on 5 of the nine facilities, it wouldn't matter because investor confidence is now gone. 

Expect yields in credit markets to rise and VIX to spike. We might even have a minor replay of March.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Trump is stabbing us in the back by sending Mnuchin to kneecap the FED's ability to print. Start hedging your positions now!",2020-11-20 01:46:42

All the DD you need on PLUG Power to know why it’s the best clean energy investment you can make,0.88,"First off, to get your attention, Blackrock has a Billion USD down on PLUG power. This company will be worth trillions by 2030

Understand that PLUG’s fuel cells already power thousands of commercial equipment such as forklifts and other supply chain hydraulic equipment. Seen a whole lot of people that think fuel cells don’t work, but I can assure you, it’s not the EV competitors that keep Elon Musk awake at night, it’s Andy Marsh and Plug Power. 

PLUG will be providing hydrogen units to power vehicles in the mid 2021, are prepared to assist OEM’s in installation and service (four major OEM’s confirmed and purchased). In other words, cars on the road in months, not years. But cars are just a side project for PLUG. 

That’s right, cars are not even the main focus of this company, they are about to control the whole green hydrogen supply chain, and I’m going to break it down for you simply. I’ve been periodically rolling over options since PLUG was at $6, and it’s going to be my early retirement. 

Here’s why: 

1) Hydrogen power allows for instant refueling, and is optimized for engine sizes on long distance hauling compared to electric- yep, this means clean energy that you don’t have to charge. This means hydrogen can be used for planes, and logistically is the best choice for trucking. 

2) Plug power doesn’t just do cars and engines they also control the refueling stations. They already have a refueling line all along the east coast of the US. For those that purchase their drive units. 

3) They are the the main processor and distributor of green hydrogen, and are investing highly in its production 

4) They have developed large scale commercial power stations (the size of a tennis court) that can generate enough energy to manage major data and cloud businesses. This is the first efficient and green independent energy source ever created. This could would allow you to put a Walmart in the Sahara Desert, and it also means you don’t need to run electrical utilities from the grid to the business. 


The Issues: 

1)first off understand that there is already electrical infrastructure across nearly the entire world. This is not a reality with hydrogen, which is why PLUG is so dedicated to building fueling stations right now. 

2) The next and main problem with PLUG power isn’t whether hydrogen works, it does, the problem is with making it a 100% clean energy, or green hydrogen. Right now most hydrogen comes from the separation and purification process of natural gasses, which is considered a dirty process, making that hydrogen not classified as green hydrogen. In order to achieve 100% green hydrogen, they must process hydrogen using solar and other forms of clean energy processes. PLUG and it’s associates in the sector must build a strong enough infrastructure in order to process and distribute enough green hydrogen to drop the price of clean hydrogen to a competitive price with other clean energy forms. 
Plug power is solving this, and well on its way to making, processing, and distributing enough clean hydrogen to drop the price of clean hydrogen to make it competitive with the price of electricity

With big moves being made to clean energy, PLUG is perfectly positioned and is a necessity for businesses that can’t stop moving to charge their equipment, and to get clean, commercial level power to areas that you can’t or isn’t financially feasible to run electrical utilities. Plug power is going to be one of the largest energy distributors in the world by 2030.  

They control nearly every bit of the process of bringing clean hydrogen to their own products, and control all the infrastructure. Best Buy you could ever make.

Here are my roll over positions, total of around 1300% : [Positions](https://imgur.com/gallery/HXqWcrn)

Edit of Edit: I’m not telling anyone that right now is the best time to buy weekly call options on PLUG. The reason I’m doing this is because I’ve come a crossed a variety of posts saying fuel cells don’t even work, along with a lot of incorrect, misinformation. I’m trying to explain simply what the company is doing outside of vehicles and because the engineering behind fuel cells, in addition to bringing hydrogen vehicles to the road is unquestionably more challenging then electric. However it actually opens up the ability for green aerospace, trucking and 24/7 commercial business. (Like Walmart and Amazon, two of PLUGs customers)",2020-11-19 05:35:32

DraftKings - What Price Levels Imply,0.92,"Hello degens, I have started doing weekly valuations and daily market debriefs. What makes me qualified to do this? I work in buyside and am semi-literate. Here is my non-investment advice on DraftKings. 

**What’s new:**  DKNG reported Quarterly adjusted revenues of $133mn (+42% year-over-year  (y/y)), which was at the high-end of the pre-announced $131mn-$133mn range. [(link)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1772757/000110465920111952/tm2031612-4_s1.htm) DKNG also reported adjusted EBITDA of -$197mn, better than Wall St. Consensus expectation of -$203mn.

Also with the earnings release, management increased revenue guidance  to $540mn to $560mn, and introduced 2021 revenue guidance of  $750mn-$850mn (+45% y/y at the midpoint), the consensus estimate was  $776mn. This range doesn’t include contributions from Michigan or  Virginia, which could both launch online sports betting late this year  or early next. Management’s guidance assumes that they continue to  operate in all states where they are currently live and announced sport  calendars aren’t disrupted. 

**Valuation Methodology:** I continue from my initial  valuation of DKNG last week – What’s clear is that more states will  legalize betting and more Americans will be exposed to sports betting  and online gambling avenues and the market will grow overall. What is  less clear, however, is how fast this market will grow. I approach this  valuation by starting high level, focusing on the growth of online  betting markets, and then following with DKNG’s market share of the  future betting markets. I believe **DKNG is simply a beneficiary of overall online betting market growth, not some standalone idiosyncratic tech pioneer,** therefore  I believe starting with Total Available Market (TAM) is the best  approach for a valuation here. From Deutsche Bank in their updated Note  on DKNG ‘Limited Changes to Forecasts’ “We expect the market to continue  to trade shares around TAM and growth trajectory views, much of which  will be dictated by the pace of legalization and investors garnering a  better understanding of how \[that\] ultimately flows to net revenue and,  down the road, EBITDA.” We use 2025 EBITDA as anything beyond five years is simply impossible  to predict. Feel free to disagree with me in the comments and tell me  why you disagree.

I try to keep this analysis high level so we can plug and play growth  figures for both the market and DKNG’s share of that future market  because analyzing line items or on modelling on revenue multiples, is a  pointless exercise for growth companies because appreciating from $500M  to $5B is way more likely than $100B to $1trn. This is a rapidly  changing company in a disruptive industry and it’s stock price reflects  expectations of the future of American online gambling and DraftKings’  ability to capture an increasing share of that market growth. 

**How is the Street valuing DKNG?:** Goldman is Neutral  rated with a 12-month price target of $53 based on equal parts 2030  EV/EBITDA (discounted), 21.3X 2024 Sales, and a Discounted Cash Flow  model.

Morgan Stanley is in-line and equal-weighted with a price target of  $37 valuing DKNG on a 18.5x 2025 EBITDA model. 18.5X is a comparable  tech multiple. 

Deutsche Bank models DKNG at a price target of $48 on a multiples of  25x 2027 EBITDA, discounted at 5% for 5 years. They note that every 10%  move in EBITDA from their current forecast is worth \~$4 to their Price  Target and every multiple point is \~$2.

**Our Model:** I start off with management’s 45% y/y  growth figure for 2021. I credit DKNG with this growth next year, then  crucially, I decrease the growth rate by 5% every year forward, so 40%  growth in 22, 35% in 23, etc. because **DKNG is starting from a smaller revenue base so 45% will be easier to achieve in 21 than it will be from a higher base in 23**.

If the online sports betting and gambling markets grow at these rates  from 2020-2025 (about a 35% annual growth rate), and DKNG is able to  capture a 23% blended total market share of these markets, at a 30%  EBITDA margin and 18.5x EBITDA multiplier (we borrow this from MS), I  get a valuation of around $39, implying \~9% downside. Let’s look closer:

I start off by estimating the online sports betting and gambling  market size below. I go off the estimated 2020 figure of around $3.14bn –  $1.33bn from sports gambling, $1.5bn from iGaming, and $286mm from  Daily Fantasy. Next I grow them by the CAGR’s in the previous paragraph  and you see the results. For purposes of this valuation I designate this  growth profile as my Base case. I don’t want you to stay fixated on the  \~35% CAGR but rather to see the effects of the rate on overall market  size come 2025. We can argue all day about the numbers, but trying to  estimate the growth of the market to the decimal for 5 years out is not  an efficient exercise. This is still a nascent market experiencing a lot  of disruption with no clear predecessor case studies.

[we get a TAM of over $14bn in 2025 with our estimates](https://preview.redd.it/t30x9yg71qz51.png?width=2045&format=png&auto=webp&s=e08d7b245f1f6921194ba48f1439bf9235a67418)

 **Is this a reasonable TAM:** Deutsche Bank is a noted Bear on this sort of sports betting TAM Share argument in the 20bn to 25bn  range for sports betting. They say in their “A Lot of Unfounded  “Expectations” at a Lofty Price; Remain Sell” Note on Penn National,  “Said simply, in the period from March 2019 through February 2020, prior  to the pandemic, the per adult spend on sports betting (GGR/NJ adult  population) was $51. Given there are 240 mm adults in the US, to arrive  at even a $20bn TAM, implied that not only does every state legalize and  all 240 mm adults can bet sports on their mobile phones, but that … the  adult spend grows by \~65% from this $51 level”. I look at the idea of full legalization and spend per adult in the table below. 

[my estimates](https://preview.redd.it/wtxr7tl41qz51.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=b312d244223438e31c41464b06b6a153246d3205)

To get to our $20bn TAM, indeed every US adult would need to be  spending $84 a year on sports betting and online gambling. This ties out  with DB’s 65% figure.

Next I estimate the DraftKings’ EBITDA based on the market size and  their share of this future market. An important point is DKNG’s  promotions and how much it subtracts from top-line revenue. We use 20%  here, but management has stated in the past that promotions are  generally in the high 20%’s. We give DKNG credit for being able to  continue to decrease promotional activity in the future, so for our 2025  EBITDA analysis we settle on 20%. Just for reference, promotions were  \~26% in Q1 and Q2 of this year. 

I use a healthy 30% EBITDA margin across all levels of market share  and market size. As you can see, our Base Case is $785 mm in EBITDA for  2025. Not bad for a company expected to have over negative $400mm in  EBITDA for 2020.

[my estimates](https://preview.redd.it/koro8zd21qz51.png?width=1466&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d9832798a99afa1408ef0046b9fc583e75b2b62)

Finally, given the current stock price of $42.84 at close on 11/13, what  is the implied 2025E EBITDA multiple for all these scenarios? Here’s a  table summarizing that below: 

[ At the close of 11\/13 DKNG is valued at 20.38x our 2025 estimated EBITDA based on our model assumptions and estimates ](https://preview.redd.it/udn68v801qz51.png?width=1438&format=png&auto=webp&s=38002b750b3c13a96b5e596b2fa52efbe6d48363)

Every additional turn in the EBITDA multiple adds \~$2 to our price  and every additional $100 mm in 2025 EBITDA adds \~$5. If the market  grows by only 15%/ year with lower market share and EBITDA margins in  our Bear Case, we get a valuation of $14. Likewise, if the market grows  at 45%/year with higher market share and EBITDA margins in our Bull  Case, we get a $75 valuation.

I layout some clearer Bear/Base/Bull Case scenarios at the bottom as well in more detail:

**Upside Risks to Valuation:**

1. Stronger than expected performance in 2021, which could accelerate growth in TAM realizations
2. Better-than expected margin performance, especially less promotion activity that eats into top-line revenue
3. DKNG is able to take outsized market share
4. Favorable regulatory events and large states making progress toward sports betting

**Downside Risks to Valuation:**

1. Considerable stock unloaded coming off management lockup agreements from the IPO 
2. TAM expectations becoming more muted, leaving far-out forecasts like the 2025 EBITDA we use being especially vulnerable
3. Promotional activity could last longer than we think and be a drag on revenue
4. Greater impact from competitors, leading to decreased market share and/or further necessitated promotional spend
5. Negative legislative outcomes

The only DD you will ever need.,0.85,"Hello WSB,

We are from all walks of life, but we all share one thing in common, the need for tendies. While there have been some success in the past, TSLA, NIO, PLUG, etc., this is only a fraction of our true gaining potential.

Sure, 600%, 2000%+ seems like reasonable gains for a stock, but let me assure you it is not. To see the future, we must first revisit some previous memes..

$SPCE, $RKT, and some new add ons including $MOON and $FAST.

What’s one thing these all have in common you ask? I’ll tell you, free tendies. That’s right, it’s in the name, Space, Rocket, Moon, Fast. Need I say anymore? Put your money where your mouth is, see you on the moon. Or somewhere further in space.",2020-11-13 15:50:58

From the guy that brought you PLUG power: PEIX,0.79,"Hello everyone, I recently read about this new stock PEIX. I am yet to take a position but would like to know all of your opinions.

Pacific Ethanol produces food, animal feed, renewable gasses and *industrial alcohols* 

The stock is up 795% this year, but analysts consensus is that it should reach 16.50 in about a years time, and it has a strong buy consensus. 

“Investors should note that management indicated that though the company has a firm visibility on pricing, specialty alcohol volumes delivered to customers could vary on a quarterly basis. Given that sanitizers are a key end-market for specialty alcohols, the stock has come under some pressure with positive COVID-19 vaccine related news. However, we believe demand for sanitizer products should remain elevated with increase in any economic activity in the near term. We believe the improved balance sheet and cash flow is allowing the company to make investments in areas of the business that have been previously overlooked, and may have been under-contributing as a result,”",2020-11-12 03:37:17

Look no further the PLUG train is here.

Plug Power (PLUG),0.8,"Total of 6 new price targets: $30, $26, $24 $23, $22, $21

+ Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer assigned a Buy rating to Plug Power, with a price target of $23.00. 

+ H.C. Wainwright analyst Amit Dayal maintained a Buy rating on Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) on Tuesday, setting a price target of $30, which is approximately 47.71% above the present share price of $20.31.

+ Craig-Hallum analyst Eric Stine raised the firm's price target on Plug Power to $26 from $14 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst cites the company's Q3 beat, raised fiscal year 2020 guidance and maintained outlooks for 2021/2024.

+ Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin raised the firm's price target on Plug Power to $22 from $13 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst notes that Plug posted ""strong"" Q3 upside, with revenue and EBITDA ahead by $15.5M and $14.5M, respectively. However, Q4 implied guide was below estimates, reflecting seasonal Q3 deliveries strength at key customers, Irwin adds. The analyst believes much of the material long-term value creation at Plug will come from FC trucks and green hydrogen, and both of these initiatives remain on track. He would buy on any weakness.

+ B. Riley Securities analyst Christopher Souther raised the firm's price target on Plug Power to $24 from $18 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares following the company's ""strong"" Q3 results. Management continues to execute well in material handling and is very bullish on adjacent market opportunities in backup power and commercial vehicles where ramps are likely to begin early to middle of next year, Souther tells investors in a research note.

+ Barclays analyst Moses Sutton raised the price target on Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG) to $21.00 (from $13.00) while maintaining a Overweight rating.

Cheaper Stonks/Market Inconsistency,0.4,"1) Something is off 
Therapeutics working? Regeneron preventing hospitalizations? Is that why Zoom (ZM), Amwel (AMWL), teladoc (TDOC), Dominos (DPZ)are down? Maybe, but shouldn’t VNO, JBLU (and other airlines/real estate companies) be up? Why are they getting crushed too (other than me owning them). Don’t tell me, “People are holding cash to wait and see what happens.” Someone’s right and someone’s wrong. Either we are reopening everything soon or we are going to continue as is and Zoom and stay at home plays are going to rip higher, or, people are going back to NYC. 

2) Gaming
I told you hoes to buy Sony, it’s still a buy. They are allowed to sell image sensors to Huawei and PS5 fucks. India is getting into gaming too, demand going to skyrocket. Also, can someone please explain what Unity does and if NVIDIA is going to be the Netflix of video games? Too many consoles. And on the gaming note, for cell phone FPS, can we just get a controller to plug into a smart phone? Is it too embarrassing/clunky to have? Fuck it, I’ll just watch Doctor Disrespect on my phone (Halloween Costume of the year for sure). 

3) Fastly is down the shitter. 
Does Cathy Woods still have it? And, if you really think Biden will win and let Xi have America (Publicly v. Privately if Sun King wins), that means they can do business with tik tok again and you’d have to like it’s price point, no?

4) Costco, Walmart, Target are Always slammed. I walk by the parking lots (like a plebe) during the week to get lunch and they are always packed. Even on weekdays. Only Costco and Walmart excite me. Walmart for untapped tech potential (if you believe they’ll get tik tok) and Costco bc, well, Chickenbake. Costco has self checkout now so that’s going to be a fucking nightmare.",2020-10-30 10:51:23

Everything Is Priced In: Let's calculate how much growth Zoom and Tesla have priced in,0.92,"**TL;DR:** Puts on ZM, TSLA

You probably have heard the phrase or even shit posted it yourself: ""It's priced in"". Usually, it's used to easily dismiss someone else's well-crafted DD, however today let's use it to actually do something useful with it. Let's find out, how much growth is priced in in the current price of Zoom and Tesla. As a comparison I also included Microsoft and P&G.

Now follows the detailed description of how I calculated that. If you are only interested in the results, scroll to the bottom.

How would you even calculate something like that? I will do it with the so-called [Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cash_flow). The intuition behind it is that by buying stock you essentially lose out on the returns the cash you used to buy the stock could yield somewhere else, like if you invested it in bonds or an S&P 500 ETF (or of course in FDs, whatever floats your boat). So, this model takes this into account by treating the cash you pay today (or more accurately, its current market cap) as a discounted cash flow of the future returns.

To be able to use this model, we need to make several assumptions. First, we need to decide on a time-frame in which we expected the company to completely earn its current valuation. I will use 10 years here as a very generous value.

Second, we need to decide what the cash flow actually will be. For this very simplified application of the DCF model I used the Net Income of the last quarter. I will call this N. In the end we want to have a growth rate as a result which tells us how much the quarterly earnings will need to increase every quarter to earn its entire valuation in the given time-frame. I will call this q.

To account for the equity a company already has, its current equity E must also be included in its future returns. Again, as a very generous estimation, I will assume that the equity will appreciate like the average returns of the S&P 500 in the last 10 years which is 16.3%.

Finally we need the discounted cash value. This is the current market cap M of the company. We also need to decide on an interest rate to discount M. Again, very generously, instead of assuming that M should also be assumed to have the average S&P 500 returns, we will instead only use the much lower, essentially risk-free returns of the 10Y US bonds, which currently is 0.75%.

To summarize, we made the following assumptions:

* Time frame of 10 years
* Equity E appreciates by average S&P 500 returns of 16.3% every year
* Cash flow is given by the net quarterly income N
* Current market cap M is discounted by 10Y US bond yield, which is 0.75%

Now, we can formulate the following equation that puts the expected growth of N into relation with the other variables:

    E * 1.163^10 + N * (q^(4 * 10) - 1) / (q - 1) = M * 1.0075^10

(Equity in 10 years plus quarterly earnings of the next 10 years that grow by q every quarter must equal discounted market cap )

Now we only need to select a company and solve the equation for q. This can be done by using approximation methods like Newton's method, or just plug it into Wolfram Alpha.

As mentioned in the title, let's first start with Zoom and Tesla. All values are in Million USD:

##Zoom:

    E = 1198.81
    N = 185.99
    M = 160400

This gives us q = 1.12575 as a result. So, for Zoom, its current market cap has a yearly growth of q^4 - 1 = 60.61% priced in *for every year in the next 10 years*. Note that this already includes the Q2 earnings which were almost 7 times higher than Q1 earnings.

##Tesla:

    E = 9855
    N = 11202
    M = 1658500

This results in q = 1.17685. So, for Tesla, its current market cap has a even larger yearly growth of q^4 - 1 = 91.82% priced in *for every year in the next 10 years*.

##Microsoft and P&G:

For comparison, let's also calculate this for less meme-y stocks. I chose Microsoft and P&G, let me know if you want to know the results for other stocks.

Microsoft:

    E = 118304
    N = 11202
    M = 1658500
    => q = 1.04679
    => q^4 - 1 = 20.07%

P&G:

    E = 46521
    N = 2800
    M = 358600
    => q = 1.02179
    => q^4 - 1 = 9.01%


Disclaimer: This is a very simplified calculation which makes many assumptions: We only look at a companies net income of the last quarter, its current equity and its market cap, nothing else. Also, this looks at a rather large time-frame of 10 years, so is not that useful for short-term stock price predictions.

To summarize: By using the DCF model we can calculate that Zoom and Tesla have priced in into their current market cap outrageously high growth rates already for the next 10 years. Around 60% and 90%, respectively.

Investing in EVs vs. FCEVs (Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles),0.86,"As we know, there are a growing number of EVs on the road today. These can be recharged from your home or at power stations which can already be found all over the country. However, there are complaints about the range of these vehicles & how long it takes to charge them. FCEVs currently have a major advantage over EVs in these two areas. FCEVs can be filled with hydrogen like you would with gasoline, and they have greater range than EVs. The problem is that there are currently only a small number of service stations in the US that have hydrogen pumps accessible to FCEVs compared to the vast amount of EV charging stations that already exist. Therefore, it seems that there is a race between the FCEV and EV markets, with EVs currently being in the lead by a landslide. However if hydrogen stations can rapidly expand across the nation, I think many consumers will pick FCEVs over EVs based on their range and charge-time. But if EVs are able to improve in range and charge-time before hydrogen stations become widespread, then EVs should continue to dominate. What will come first? Is it safe to invest in both markets or one over the other? If you choose to invest in EVs, I believe it is obvious to pick stocks like TESLA & NIO. If you choose to invest in FCEVs, I feel that it would be smart to pick the companies that make hydrogen fuel cells, such as PLUG, rather than individual carmakers. If EV technology improves in the two areas I've discussed, range and charge-time, will it simply make FCEVs irrelevant? There are pros and cons to both types of vehicles, but these seem to be two of the biggest dealbreakers. Thoughts?",2020-10-16 17:04:01

The classic WSB story - lost it all.,0.83,"Going to keep this simple. EDIT: this isn’t simple and I should write a short story on this.

I am generally risk averse. I hate losing $100 at the casino, I hate paying extra for guac at chipotles, I will return something or price match an item for a few dollars of savings. I am generally frugal.

But, I somehow had no issues losing 10k in options...

How I started

I remember my first trades like they were yesterday. I was trading the first hydrogen run-up in 2014 (FCEL, BLDP, PLUG) and made a few hundred dollars over a couple weeks.

I quickly progressed to penny stocks / biotech binary events and general stock market gambling mid-2014. I was making a few % here and there but the trend was down in total account value. I was the king of buying the peak in run-ups.  I managed to make it out of 2014 close to break-even to slightly down.

WSB Era

March 2015 was my first option trade. It was an AXP - American Express - monthly option trade. I saw one of the regular option traders/services post a block of 10,000 calls that had been bought for 1.3 and I followed the trade with 10 call options for a total of $1300.

I woke up the next day to an analyst upgrade on AXP and was up 50% on my position. I was addicted! I day-dreamed for days about my AXP over night success. I think around that time there was some sort of Buffet buyout of Heinz and an option trade that was up a ridiculous amount of %%%. I wanted to hit it BIG.

I came up with the idea that all I needed to reach my goal was a few 100% over night gains/ 1k>2k>4k>8k> etc. I convinced myself that I would have no problems being patient for the exact criteria that I had set and worked on some other trades.

Remember, the first win is always free. 

I was trading options pretty regularly from March 2015 until August 2016. During my best week I was up 20k and could feel the milli within reach. I can remember the exact option trade (HTZ) and I was trading weeklies on it.

For those who have been in the market long enough, you will remember the huge drawdown of August 2015. 

I lost half my account value on QCOM calls (100 of them) that I followed at the beginning of July and never materialized. I watched them eventually go to 0. It was another 10,000 block that was probably a hedge or sold.

In August 2015 there were some issues with China and all of us woke up to stocks gapping down huge.  Unfortunately my idea of buying far dated calls during the following days/weeks after the crash went sideways. I quickly learned that an increase in volatility causes a rise in option prices and I was paying a premium for calls that were going to lose value very quickly (the infamous IV crush).

I kept trading options into the end of 2015 and managed to maintain my account value positive but the trading fees for the year amounted to $30,000+. My broker was loving it.

I tried all the services, all the strategies. I created rules for my option plays:
1. No earnings
2. Only follow the big buys at a discount (10,000 blocks or more).
3. No weekly options
4. Take profit right away
5. Take losses quickly
6. etc.

I had a whole note book of option plays that I was writing down and following. I was paying for option services that all of you know about - remember, they make money on the services and not trading.

I even figured out a loop-hole with my broker: if I didn’t have enough money in my account, I could change my ask price to .01 and then change it to market buy and I would only need to accept a warning ⚠️ for the order to go through. I was able to day trade the option and make money, who cares if I didnt have enough? After a few months of this, I got a call from my broker that told me to stop and that I would be suspended if I continued with this.

By the way, I was always able to satisfy the debit on the account - so it wasn’t an issue of lack of funds.

Lost it all. Started taking money from lines of credits, every penny that I earned and losing it quicker and quicker. 

I was a full on gambler but I was convinced that 8 trades would offset all the losses. I kept getting drawn in to the idea that I could hit a homerun and make it out a hero.

I eventually hit rock bottom on some weekly expiring FSLR options that I bought hours before expiration and said to myself - what the f are you doing? I resolved to invest for the long term and stop throwing tendies away.

The feeling was reinforced during the birth of my first born and I thought - what a loser this kid will think of me if he knew how much I was gambling and wasting my life. It was a really powerful moment looking at my kid and reflecting on this idea.

I decided at that point I was going to save every penny I had and invest it on new issues with potential. 

Fall 2016

TTD, COUP and NTNX IPO ‘ed I decided I was going to throw every dollar at these and did so for the next few months. I eventually started using margin (up to 215%) and buying these for the next 6 months. They paid out and managed to make it over 100k within the year. 

The first 100k was hard but once I crossed it, I never fell below this magic number.

2017 - I did some day trading but it was mostly obsessing over the above issues. I did gamble on a few options here and there but never more than 1k.

2018 - SFIX was my big winner, I bought a gap up in June 2018 and my combined account value had crossed 400k by August 2018. I was really struggling at crossing the 500k account value and experienced 3 x 30-40% drawdowns over the next 2 years before I finally crossed the 500k barrier and have never looked back.

I still made some mistakes over the next few months - AKAO & GSUM come to mind. Both of these resulted in 20k+ losses. Fortunately my winners were much bigger than my losers.

I thought about giving up and moving to index funds - but i was doing well - just experiencing large drawdowns because of leverage. 

2019 big winners were CRON SWAV STNE. 

2017 / 2018 / 2019 all had six digit capital gains on my tax returns. 

At the beginning of 2020 I was still day trading on margin (180-220%) and got a call from my broker that they were tightening up my margin as my account was analyzed by the risk department and deemed too risky. Believe it or not this was right before the covid crash. I brought my margin down to 100-110% of account value and even though the drawdown from covid hit hard, I wasn’t wiped out. 

I stayed the course and bought FSLY / RH during the big march drawdown and this resulted in some nice gains over the next few months.

I am constantly changing and testing my investment strategy but let me tell you that obsessing over 1 or 2 ideas and throwing every penny at it and holding for a few years is the best strategy. It may not work at some point but right now it does.

I still day trade but I trade with 10k or less on each individual position. It allows me minimize my losses and my winners are 1-7%. I am able to consistently make between 3-700$/ a day on day trades using the above strategy. I still take losses and still dream about hitting it big with an option trade but dont feel the need to put it all on the line every month / week.

I finally crossed into the two , club. I know people are going to ask for proof or ban but I am not earning anything for posting and the details about some of the trades should be proof enough that I kept a detailed journal of it all. I have way more to write but these are the highlights.

Eventually I will share how I build a position in a story I love. I still sell buy and sell to early but I am working on improving. 

TL:DR - I gambled, lost it all and gambled some more lost more. I made it out alive. I have only sold calls/puts lately. 

The one common denominator in all successful people is how much they obsess over 1 or 2 ideas. Do the same.  All the winners on this sub have gone all in on one idea (FSLY / TSLA ). Stick with new stories or ones that are changing and go all in...wait a second, I didnt learn anything.",2020-10-11 16:42:10

However, if the call exercises when it is ITM, you will be forced to sell 100 shares of spy at 335 no matter what the price is.    

\>Now a poor man's covered call uses the same strategy, however using a different collateral. You see, when you buy a call, you are buying the right to buy 100 shares of the underlying at an agreed upon price. Therefore lets take this example, I buy a 335 call on spy, if I exercise it, I can buy a 100 shares of spy for 335 each. Now this right gives us incredible leverage, because we are able to do this, at the same time we can sell another call, such a 335 call. Now if the 335 call we sold is ITM and we are forced to exercise, then we exercise the call we bought, buy 100 shares for 335, and sell it to the other guy for 335, then we’re released from all of its obligation. This also applies to call you sell that are at a higher strike price then the one you’re holding, see if you’re forced to exercise, you’ll make the difference in intrinsic value back as profit. Such as selling a call at the 336 strike price, if you’re forced to exercise then you’ll actually make a 100$.     

\>Ok you’re with me so far? We have one more strategy to talk about, the diagonal spread. The diagonal spread is a strategy where you buy a long dated call say four months out, and sell another call at a higher strike price and shorter strike price. That way you make money from the premium of the short strike call, while simultaneously making money on the long dated call we bought.     

\>So this strategy employs these two strategies together on SPY. So let's get started to how you would set this up. First of all, you’ll go to SPY, and look at the current price. Currently Spy closed at 333.91, so we will use this value for our calculations. Now the usual way to find the best long dated option to buy, is to find one that is very close to being OTM or even a dollar or two ITM. The best date is 4 months plus, because you'll have around two months of negligible theta.      

\>An important point here, the further out the better as the less theta, the more money this will generate long term. In addition, the more ITM the call is the better because it gives you more leeway, I’ll explain how to use this to your advantage later.    

\>So in our case, the best call to buy, is the 333c Jan 15 2021 for 1943$. Now you buy this, and you’re a proud owner of this call, now it’s time to start selling a call against it. The closest next expiry date is sep 14. Now the 336c call is looking pretty spicey with it’s 123$ premium, so we sell it.    

\>Now a very simple plug in of the call you sold into a \[profit calculator\]([https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/)) we see that for this call to remain over the 123$ worth spy will have to open at 337.50 or higher which is more then 4$ increase, which isn’t always likely. Now let’s go over the few scenarios that might occur:    

\>>\* spy opens below 337.50, in which case the call will lose its value. As long as spy doesn’t close above 336, then you get to keep the premium, and if spy hovers around the current price and up to 334, the call becomes worth less then 20$, which means you can buy it back and get to keep the 100$ + difference    

\>>\*Spy moons 9 points to 342 in one day. To close the call it would cost you 553$ as it would be worth 675. However, keep in mind that our long dated call is now worth 2397. Therefore, if we closed both options we will be at a total loss of 50$. This happens due to gamma of the short call being higher, due to it's shorter expiry date. If you had cash, you can buy back that call you sold, and lose 553 cash on hand, and be 50$ negative on your entire portfolio. Then you can turn around and sell more calls    

\>>\*Spy has a retarded correction, or even god forbid a crash. In which case your long dated call will rapidly lose value and if spy loses more then 15% of its value, such as below 280$ then you lose 85% of the value of the spread. On the other a correction of 10%, would make the spread lose 65% of its value    

\>>It’s very important to remember, the type of equity that spy represents, which is the entire US market. For context, in the last 5 years, spy has only had 7 instances of a correction over 10% which can result in a heavy loss with this strategy. Now let’s look at the possible actions to take in every scenario.    

\>>\*If the call has lost more then 80% of its value, or really any amount where your profits are over 120, them buy it back and close it.    

\>>\*If the call becomes ITM and you’re forced to close it, then look at your options(no pun intended)    

\>>>\*If you have enough cash to close it, and you don’t have any possible use for that available cash within the next two weeks then close it.     

\>>>\*If you don’t have enough money to close the call or you’re not willing to lose that available cash, then simply close both options with either a profit or a loss depending on how had spy mooned that day.        

\>Now after you’ve done this once, let’s say you were successful and the call you sold was worth less and you made premium back. Now you have more cash on hand, and you’ve made money. Keep in mind, this also means more leeway, in case the next trade you might have to close the short call at a loss, either available cash loss, or net loss.     

\>Doing the math on possible profits. In a single month, you are able to sell 12 spy calls. If a spy remains flat, or has a slow upwards trend, and says on average you sell your calls at a profit of 100$, then you can make 1200$ from the spy, on a 2000$ investment. Every month, until expiry on the long call. If spy rises, then your initial call would also increase in value, resulting in extra profits when you eventually close it.     

\>\_\_NOW COMPARE THIS TO THE WHEEL STRATEGY\_\_ you would need a minimum of 33,000$ in order to buy a 100 shares of spy. Now first of all, the upfront collateral is ridiculous, and not many can afford it. If you’re asking yourself, well why can’t I use a cheaper stock, remember that only a spy has 12 contracts per month, every other etf and stock only has 4 per month. Furthermore, due to the sheer volume of spy, it's more reliable in terms of premiums.    

\>Here’s the best part too, spy increasing in value won’t benefit you with the wheel strategy, as you’re forced to sell your shares at the strike price of the short call. On the other hand, let’s compare the potential losses with this strategy, If spy were to lose 10% of value down to 300, then you’ll lose 3000$ vs only 1600$ with our long call. In addition, if spy keeps losing value you’ll keep losing money, while your gains are capped with the long call.     

\>Thereby the obvious advantages of this strategy:    

\>>\*We profit from spy’s increase of value and its flatness        

\>>\*Our maximum losses are capped, and the more successful calls we sell the less our risk becomes.        

\>>\*Our total needed collateral is a fraction of spy, at usually around 6%. Keep in mind that the same call, 333c at an expiration of sep 17 2021, a leap year call, is only 3000$, which is still only 9% of the value we’d usually need.     

\>And the best part, is how scalable this is, at an average of 100$ per contract sold profits, we can make back out entire about a month and a half, and we can buy another long contract. This way, spending 4000$, for an average return of 200$ per contract. This is ofcourse not counting our long dated calls increasing value with spy.     

\>This is to make your mouth water at the possible tendies. A 10,000$ investment, which is 5 contracts, can generate 6000$ per month on average, or even higher depending on market conditions. Keep in mind, the same amount of money, the 33,000 needed to use the wheel strategy, can generate 20,000 a month, vs the regular 1200 it can generate.    

\>Keep in mind, this only works if spy is in an flat and positive trend. To put things into perspective, it takes 1.5 months to generate enough money to buy a second contract.  Now that you’d be making double the money, that means you’ll need half the time, to get the second contract, and because we’re buying the contract at a higher strike price for the same price of around 2000, we keep covering higher and higher values of spy. So the second contract takes 1.5 months, the second would take three weeks, the third would take a week and half, the fourth would take 2 option dates, and them you’ll be making enough money to buy another call, every weekly option.    

\>I’ll make a part 2 about how to take this strategy further if you are successful to layer calls upon calls, virtually building a tranche that becomes very profitable.     

\>So I hope you employ this strategy to start making real money, and generating actual returns that are consistent, while still basking in the glory of theta gang, without needing the ridiculous amount of collateral

\>TLDR : For the absolute retards who don't want to read but instead want to know positions: you’ll need around 2000 - 2500 $ to employ this strategy correctly        

\>>\*Buy long dated spy call, 4+ months out such as 335c Spy Jan 15 2021     

\>>\*Then sell calls on weekly spy, 3-5$ OTM     

\>>\*If the call you sold becomes ITM, buy it back with the cash on hand, if you can't, close both positions, and re-enter your long position at a higher strike price

\>>\*If not, buy the call back on the expiration day when it's lost 80% + of its value    

\>>\*Rinse and repeat    

\>>\*You’ll only be able to sell calls in this scenario, of 335c or higher, therefore if a spy's value drops where the 335c becomes worthless to sell, in this case if its value is less than a 100. Then exit your long dated call, and buy another one at spy’s current level",2020-09-12 08:00:06

Spread the Love,0.94,"It only takes ten 100% investments to get from $1000 to $1,000,000

I see a lot of people posting calls on here. Calls are the types of posts that do well on this site. WSB is all about %1000 trades, and a %100 trade likely isn't gonna get much attention. Consistent 100% trades will get you rich just the same. A poll from a while back showed that a lot of the users on here have been trading for less than 6 months, and likely don't know much about spreads. I'm also pretty new to this. 


A 2000c 9/11 costs $14,000. Can't afford a Tesla call? A 2000/2100 9/11 spread costs $4000 and can make you $6000. 


Take AAPL, what are the odds that apple goes up $5 on any given month? I mean it's not guaranteed of course, but it's pretty fucking likely.

It currently trades for 469. A 470/475 spread for September 4th costs $205 right now. Plug this spread into optionsprofitcalculator.com, and you'll see that if AAPL is 475 or higher at the end of the day on September 4th, you'll make a 144% profit.

$205 is accessible to just about anyone, and you can always buy more spreads if you can afford to. I get that there is a stock split, and apple will likely go up by more than just $5 by September 4th, but you can do this $5 spread over and over for a ~likely~ 144% gain everytime.

A $475 call for Sept 4 by itself costs about $1200. You could buy 6 spreads with the same amount. %144 of 1200 is $1728. In order to make that same amount of money with a call, AAPL would have to go up by at least $15. The beauty of the spread is that you're only betting AAPL will go up by $5. 

As long as you pick a stock with relatively consistent small growth you can make a killing with lots of trades betting on small swings.


TLDR: debit call spreads make more money than you think. Buy AAPL 470c 9/4, sell AAPL 480c 9/4. 144% return (almost) guaranteed. Rinse and repeat just $5 otm. Can double your money every 3 weeks.

Edit: I'm not advocating that you put all of your money in one stock over and over again until you get to $1,000,000. Debit spreads cost less than a call, so small accounts can actually use this strategy to diversify more. Be smart, people.",2020-08-20 20:28:59

Multiple Display setup,0.47,"Hello,

I have been day trading for a few months now, I recently upgraded my setup to include 2 external monitors to my laptop. I have hooked up both screens via HDMI cables to my adaptor (pic #1), its a thunderbolt goes into usb-c port on my laptop (Dell xps-13).

I Would like somehow to save my trader workstation windows so every morning when I fire up my laptop, they are automatically restored to where I left them last.  Can anyone tell me how to save my multiple display settings? I am using windows 10, the display setup seems to be a pain in the ass, sometimes I take out the adaptor USB-c plug and when I plug it back in it totally re-numbers and jumbles all the screens. This is driving me insane! I'm not sure if this is more a windows issue, or an IB TWS issue, perhaps somewhere in the IB settings, I can save my external monitor setup. Perhaps there is some sort of dummy plug I can buy, to save my setup while I take my laptop to use in other rooms elsewhere, or when I shut down my laptop.

The issue I'm having is that when I unplug the HDMI adaptor, every morning when I plug it back in all my tws windows end up on my laptop screen only . and I have to drag them all back to where I like them. This is getting tedious and annoying to me, and I know there has to be a better way!I'm like half savvy with computers but this one is stumping me, also pissing me off!

In a Kangaroo market like this I find myself looking to SPY for entry points on calls/puts and try not to go against the grain..

The technical picture suggesting a move to SPY 315 and a break above that would send SPY to 327.50  
\*But from there, the index could pull back to a low of around 300  
\*A break below 296.50 opens for significant downside  
and we would expect to see 273 within a few trading sessions

JPOW also said he sees a three stage economic path..  
stage 1 - the shutdown with sharp drop in activity - ends in June  
stage 2 - the bounceback with sharp increase in MoM economic data - ends in July  
stage 3 - we find that the economy is ""well short"" of pre-pandemic levels and go 'oh shit'

\*PPP funds running out in June for business that secured loans in April.. (PPP deadline extended to Aug 8th)  
\*Federal bans on evictions in federally assisted properties ends July 25  
\*Federal unemployment extra $600 ends July 31st

\*The markets will be prepping next month for the first release of 2nd quarter GDP which has been   
projected to drop anywhere from 30% to 50%  
prior trends..  
Q2 2019: +2.0%  
Q3 2019: +2.1%  
Q4 2019: +2.1%  
Q1 2020: -5.0%

\*The HEROES Act, if passed by the senate, could include..  
second round of stimulus checks  
extension of the $600 increase in unemployment

What to expect as banks report earnings:  
\-expect another big hit to earnings as they set aside more money to cover loan losses  
\-a boost in fee income from elevated trading activity  
\-Banks not allowed to raise dividends or perform share buy-backs through Q3 2020  
\*Wells Fargo & Co. WFC appears at greatest risk for a dividend cut among the “big six” U.S. banks

\*analysis of the government data found that just over 554,000 small businesses who got PPP funds   
reported retaining zero jobs - raising concerns about how many will be eligible for forgiveness in the future

\*Consumer borrowing fell dropped BIGLY in April, less in May, and even less in June.. But use of consumer credit is down YoY for each month of Q2  
\*Revolving credit, like credit cards, declined at a nearly 29% clip in May. In April, revolving credit shrank by a record 65% as people paid down debt.  
\*For companies that rely on transaction volume and late fees for revenue generation.. this will hurt Q2 earnings (MA, V, etc.)

\*Yet nonrevolving credit, typically auto and student loans, actually rose 2.3%. Auto sales rebounded   
during the month (ALLY CVNA)

\*As Bloomberg cautions, the pace of recent Chinese gains matches the market’s melt-up that started in the final weeks of 2014.. before a huge crash in SHCOMP.. 

\*Global restaurant traffic data via OpenTable shows little improvement in late June  
OpenTable recently warned that 25% of all U.S. restaurants would never reopen

Energy: A Deloitte analysis has found that almost a third of U.S. shale producers are technically insolvent with crude at $35 a barrel.  
Analysts predict 250 oil/gas/shale may go bankrupt with companies now filing for bankruptcy at the fastest pace since 2009

(COF) Capital One said nearly three-quarters of its $6.24 billion exposure to the oil and gas industry   
lies with companies responsible for exploration and production.

(BAM) Broofield Asset Management tenants will go bankrupt.. but BAM has requested forbearance  
on the loans BAM owes for 12-months..

\-------

\*of course, any news on PPP-extension, more unemployment checks, or a vaccine could always cause a rally

\*\*\*If you must buy puts, buy them on IWM, not SPY.. FANG will have retard strength as long as printer go brrrr.. and JPOW buys AAPL bonds..",2020-07-10 18:36:45

step 1. a few of us get jobs at amazon warehouses and we count the number of daily packages

step 2. we wait 2 quarters or so, and correlate average daily number of packages to EPS

step 3. wait another Q and plug in number of packages for prior quarter to EPS regression day before earnings call

Amazon Will Be The Next $2T Company – Why it’s Undervalued,0.78,"Forget the hype about Tesla, Amazon is undervalued and is the safest place to park your money. I breakdown the reasons why below. Excuse the long post, but I like helping people make $. TLDR at the end. 

The only way to look at Amazon's business is to separate it out into three very large businesses, I will break down each and why I believe the company as a whole is undervalued:

A/ Retail & Marketplace - this is the consumer facing portion of their business where Amazon buys at wholesale and then sells to shoppers. The latter (Marketplace), is the faster growing and more profitable business unit, now accounting for over 55% of all orders. Sellers use FBA and sell their products to shoppers directly where Amazon takes a \~7%-\~15% fee depending on the category.

B/ AWS – fast growing cloud business operating at 26% gross margins with a $50B run-rate growing 30% YoY (do you know how crazy it was typing that out?)

C/ Amazon Media Group - this includes their fast growing advertising business, Twitch, Amazon Music, and Amazon Prime Video. This is the least-known portion of their business, but is the fastest growing with highest margins.

**Retail & Marketplace**

There’s not much to say here, other than Amazon does roughly \~$250B in sales and growing 30% YoY on average here. For reference, Walmart does \~$500B. Even if you gave the retail/marketplace portion of Amazon’s business a conservative valuation of $500B (2x revenue), it’s a very large business. Now, take into consideration how much they are emphasizing 3P sellers and private label products, Amazon’s profitability metrics will greatly improve in this business as it lowers its overhead so the business in value will continue to grow. This also fails to mention their breadth of their FBA business and how many sellers use the product offering. If anyone has sold anything on Amazon or knows someone that does, 99% of sellers use FBA because of how easy, convenient, and cost-effective it is. With the tailwinds associated with COVID, this business will likely surpass 30% YoY growth, which is just incredible growth #s for a business this large. In comparison, Walmart is usually <10% YoY growth when it comes to their revenue metrics.  

My valuation of the business = \~$500B - $750B

**AWS**

AWS is projected to do around $50B-$60B in sales for 2020. Latest public analyst valuations peg it around \~$500B, which I believe is unfair. For reference, MongoDB is trading at 20x revenue, Crowdstrike, DOCU, Datadog, all SAAS/cloud providers are trading at 20x or even more!

Valuing AWS as a standalone business for anything less than $500B would be under-representing just how large and fast-growing this business is. Growing at 30% YoY at a $50B run-rate is just unfathomable. If we were looking at this at a 20x revenue multiple (which I believe it would be valued at a 20x multiple if it was a standalone company), AWS would be at a $1 trillion market cap alone. It's the de-facto choice for start-ups, even as Azure continues to take customers away, AWS is the leader for all new tech/start-up companies and will continue to see massive tailwinds as the entire economy shifts to cloud-based offerings. COVID has also accelerated this business as usage is undoubtedly up for their core segment of customers, while customers that are most affected (restaurants) are not really AWS-like customers. 

My valuation of this business unit = $650B

**Amazon Media Group**

Advertising – Many people don’t know much about this business, but you know the products you click on while you’re shopping around on Amazon? It’s safe to say a bunch of those products are paying Amazon significant dollars on a PPC basis (pay-per-click) to surface higher in the search results. This business generated $14 billion in revenue in 2019. Google, the leader in advertising, is valued at 10x revenue, so this business alone is probably worth close to $16B after 2020 alone. $FB did $73B in revenue trailing 12 months, this would mean FB is about 4.5x the size of Amazon's Advertising business ALONE. I just compared FB as a whole to Amazon's ""side-business"" in Advertising. 

Twitch – this is a tough business to value, but Needham and others have pegged it at \~$15 billion alone. It’s the clear leader in online streaming and Microsoft recently shutdown Mixer (their Twitch competitor). The possibilities here are endless, look for Amazon Advertising to plug in their data capabilities to target viewers of live streaming events with products soon. Twitch will soon be merged into the advertising ecosystem to begin serving targeted ads to viewers. Think ad-supported streams where there is some sort of revenue share back to the streamers. This feeds into the ecosystem where content creators make more $ (won't leave), advertisers get access to a valuable niche audience, and Amazon reaps the benefits of high-value/profitable advertising at 65% gross margins. 

Prime Video – the most surprising stat for Prime Video is that 20% of Prime members sign up primarily for Amazon Prime Video. With over 150M subscribers, analysts peg the value of Prime Video alone at $200b. Amazon has also entered the OTT ad-supported streaming market with IMDB TV (ad-supported free television). This is exclusive inventory that Amazon can offer to brands to advertise on, and compete directly with ROKU, which is valued at 15X revenue. 

Lastly, Amazon Music has 30M subscribers. Apple has 60M, and Spotify 100M. Amazon Music (Who the fuck uses it, is already half the size of Apple Music and about a 3rd of Spotify...)

Because all the businesses aren’t broken out, it’s tough valuing the entire Media Group business, but it honestly could be in the range of anywhere b/w $300B-$600B off the synergies and potential for expansion. Again, as a standalone business, this suite of products would have public market investors salivating over the growth potential. 

**Hidden Value (Areas of Opportunity)**

I went this entire DD without mentioning the huge competitive MOATs around voice (Echo = the leader), as well as their entire logistics/ground fulfillment network, Amazon GO stores, and their venture in the medical health space. Because it's nearly impossible to value these things as a whole, you can basically pencil w/e you want here from a valuation perspective.

*Amazon Retail/Marketplace Business - $650B* 

*AWS - $650B*

*Amazon Media Group - $400B*

*Hidden Value - Go stores, Fulfillment Network, Self-driving, Echo (voice), Whole Foods, Medical Venture with JP Morgan & Berkshire = $300B*

**Total = $2B**

TLDR: Amazon is undervalued at a $1.6B market cap, and the stock will be up to $3500 in the next year. Business units valued as stand-alone companies would be valued way more, growth potential is endless, and COVID has accelerated trends in favor of Amazon for the next 5 yrs.

Tesla is undervalued at $1200.,0.81,"I bought my first TSLA shares on IPO day amid everyone from Jim Cramer to auto industry friends making compelling counterarguments:

* “They can’t make a profit/They’re hemorrhaging money.”
* “Other car companies are going to make electric cars and eat their lunch.”
* “What are you, fucking stupid?”

I still have those shares, and many more I bought along the way. I think it is more than a $1200/share company, and this is my optimistic justification.

1. Tesla has more or less consistently maintained a decent gross margin, usually higher than most other automotive companies. They’ve mostly been in the position where they could be consistently profitable if they only focused on existing products. They’ve seen a huge expansion in the last few years, outfitting and growing the Fremont factory, Nevada’s factory, Buffalo, and Shanghai, as well as dozens of other small operations around those areas. Germany is coming up, Austin soon, ramping up design, manufacturing, and business employees for new products in automotive, solar, stationary storage… all that and a consistently increasing revenue, and still people say “ThEy LoSt $0.20 PeR ShArE ThEy’Re HeMoRrHaGiNg MoNeY”
2. Electric cars are better. More power, way fewer moving parts, lower total cost of ownership, and there are also mandates by many countries to go all EV. You say that GM and Toyota will start making electric cars and take their share? Car companies are bureaucratic design-by-committee dinosaurs afraid of anything but incremental change. They will forever be one step behind with a worse car that nobody is excited about. People who own Tesla cars love them, and people who don’t own them want one. Ain’t nobody excited about the next Corolla. Ain’t nobody give a fuck what loaf Fiat is pinching off next year. Fifteen years from now Tesla will absolutely be worth what Toyota is worth, and probably also a couple other auto companies that won’t make it. $285B
3. Self driving is coming. Probably not tomorrow, but within the timeframe of investment consideration. Self driving is a data problem, and Tesla has fuckloads more data than anyone else. More than they know what to do with. If a car can safely drive itself, the car manufacturer isn’t going to sell those cars to Uber. They’re going to start their own app and slide the entire market cap of ride sharing companies into their own. $100B
4. In a few months, it’s speculated that Tesla will announce its million-mile battery. This is important for a couple of reasons. It will help them take over the trucking industry with a far cheaper per-mile product ($40B). It also allows the cars to be used for stationary storage. You don’t need a 400 mile range every day. You almost never need it. Plug in your car at night and charge it up with cheap electricity. Drive to work and plug it in and set your car to sell back some energy at peak hours. This is what some people are speculating battery day will be about. You need what, 15 miles of range to get home? Sell the rest, make some money. Tesla will take something like 30% just like Apple does when you sell an app. Their $40,000 car now has a total cost of ownership less than a $20,000 gas car. You gonna buy a Tesla or a Kia Forte? If this happens, Tesla sells fuckloads more cars, and makes fuckloads more money as an energy selling middle man. 100B
5. Short shorts. 0.005B
6. Stationary storage and solar. Nobody making batteries like Tesla making batteries, and their solar is getting cheaper and growing rapidly. I’m tired of typing, you're tired of reading. $75B

$600 Billion dollar market cap. $3250 share price.

But what about Ghislaine Maxwell? And what happens when NIO steals all their secrets? What about Elon’s obviously deteriorating health and the fact that his brother is 2/3rds lizard person? If those things are worrying you, literally reevaluate your entire life.

“You make a compelling argument BonerballsDickfart, but they haven’t actually done any of that yet.” Yeah, no fucking shit, investing isn’t about what’s done, it’s about what’s going to be done. For years, the question was whether or not Tesla could survive and deliver. They just made it through a global pandemic better than any other car company. Investors are realizing all this shit is coming, and that’s why the stock is shooting up. Am I wrong? Possibly. I did just write 800 words to a subreddit that can’t be bothered to read the bottom of a Snapple bottle cap. I also probably overdid the addy this morning and I haven’t taken a shit in two days. It’s also possible that Elon goes full Howard Hughes, starts pissing in milk jars, names his kid something nonsensical and endorses Kanye West for president.

But what are the odds of that?

TL;DR Eat several bags of dicks.

My personal opinion is that this is only the beginning of Plug Power’s stocks rise.  Both the technology and cost of Fuel cell and EV are reality today, just see purchases and interests in Tesla and Nikola.

Investing Videos (and a favor request to the most powerful subreddit),0.88,"From Martin:

 

Hi everyone. I really appreciate the kind words, especially with respect to the various videos I made. Unfortunately, something happened to my YouTube account. Let me lay out the details, and perhaps someone here works at Google or YouTube, or knows someone who does, who can help. This is a bit verbose, but my experience in matters like this is that it pays to be too detailed. 

 I use a certain gmail as my 'main email'. I also have a dozen email addresses associated with various companies I've been involved in. For some reason I started making YouTube videos with one of those email addresses, not my main email. Before I could realize it, I figured, well, that'll just be my YouTube account and I'll never lose access to that email, right!?

 One joke about Hillary Clinton's reptilian DNA requiring careful procurement and examination to determine the Alex Jones-style truth of the matter, and I found myself in what could only be described as 'sleepaway camp for thugs'. The corporate email I used ended up dying due to nonpayment. Banks like to cancel their relationships with me abruptly, and the folks I put in charge of maintaining this kind of thing didn't do so great of a job. So that email attached to the YouTube with thousands of videos, millions of views, died. Then the channel died. I am 99% sure the channel is not in trouble for any violation of policy. I just think when the email is unresponsive (and YouTube is constantly sending you all kinds of spam garbage), YouTube closes your account. 

 I have access to the email in question once again. Attempting to login to YouTube with said email is not permitted since its not a gmail. This begs the question of how I used to do it before. Well, I had GSuite. So, my team signed up for GSuite again. Signing into YouTube takes a 30 day ""seasoning period"" (I have no other way to put that... probationary period?) before you can access YouTube. That should be up in a few weeks. I'm not holding my breath that all the videos will be there when we log back in.

 As many of you know, YouTube does not have a customer support function. Everything is done to make it as hard as possible for the customer to get help. So Question 1: is there an alternative channel for YouTube customer support that we're unaware of? Question 2: Does anyone have a 'plug'--either an employee at YT/GOOG or someone who knows a human being there that is willing to take 15 minutes to figure out what happened and help. 

 For me, YouTube videos were a way to show anyone who was interested a window into the 'real' me. The mainstream media concoction, which I enjoyed creating, was a fun ruse but also a self-propagating and hard to control monster. Thankfully, the authentic Shkreli was live on YouTube for all to see. Most people who saw videos of me came away with a favorable impression. Without those videos, the NBC narrative prevails. Thanks for your thoughts and attention on this matter. As a gift, I leave you with the thought that I would avoid being long any coronavirus-related securities as they universally appear to be overvalued to this observer. That's not financial advance, that's #facts.",2020-06-27 15:05:47
Google's 'Sabrina' threatens ROKU's dominance,0.78,"ROKU shareholders and prospective shareholders should read about Google's streaming device release ['Sabrina' potentially coming out later this year](https://www.xda-developers.com/google-android-tv-dongle-specs-gaming-mode-stadia-support/).

* Their device marketshare [(a plurality at \~39%)](https://www.multichannel.com/news/roku-and-fire-tv-control-70-percent-of-smp-market), secured both by actual Roku devices as well as software licenses to smart TV manufacturers like TCL, Insignia, Sharp, Hisense, Hitachi, LG.
* Their ownership of DataXu, which aside from the The Trade Desk (TTD), has the best Connected TV buying platform. They were the first to marry access to all major suppliers with a cross device graph and performance reporting. Most buying platforms or ‘Demand Side Platforms (DSPs)’ have access to the same inventory, but prior to their acquisition, DataXu did a terrific job of overlaying the right tools and technology to attract buyers. This made them an excellent acquisition target for Roku. Of course this is all a little subjective, but I’m lucky enough to work in this business, so I’m sharing some aggregated insights from ad buyers. Also worth mentioning: [Roku captures 59% of all programmatic ad marketshare.](https://blog.pixalate.com/ott-ctv-programmatic-ad-device-market-share-roku-2019#:~:text=Here%20are%20the%20top%20five,Chromecast%20(4%25))

The reason I’m highlighting all of this, is that ROKU has done what so many have failed to do…combine device marketshare with a focused, well-loved CTV buying platform. Why have FAANG struggled to do this?

* Amazon is a content producer (Prime Video) as well as a device/software manufacturer (Fire TV). They sell advertising (Amazon DSP), but so much of it is focused on shopping and direct response. It’s not a focused platform, and the ad buyers I know have shied away from Amazon DSP as an aggregated CTV buying solution for now.
* Netflix is a content producer and a CTV app. They are also known for not having advertising. To me, they are the least likely to compete with Roku on the device side, and have way too much conflict to launch a full fledged ad business that would enable ad buyers to purchase space on other apps. It doesn’t even make sense. It may not be worth a bullet on this list…but I wanted to address where they sit for those that are ROKU buyers but may not be as familiar with how the industry breaks down.
* Apple has Apple TV, but seems pretty disinterested in creating a minority report-level ad business. In fact, they’ve been the most aggressive about shutting down third party cookies. Ads in the app store are the extent of their ad business today. Maybe one day they’ll do direct sponsorships on Apple Music, but they are technological AND philosophical lightyears away from touching user ID-driven advertising.

….Google launching a plug and play device, however, is very interesting. They’ve had Android TV as a native OS, but Sabrina represents a direct attack on Roku’s independent device business. Google is also known for breaking down its ad platform into manageable parts for ad buyers. They have one platform specific to search called Search Ads 360.. and one for display & video called DV360. They also have the most widely trusted data analytics platform for marketers: Google Analytics.

If Sabrina becomes wildly popular, Roku could face a serious threat. If the rumors about Google wanting to acquire Roku are true, that would be good news for us…and may represent Google’s desire to do an instant takeover of the CTV device space. This is why I'm waiting to open any new positions for now.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Still bullish on ROKU in the longterm as they have an unbelievable head start, but Google’s Sabrina device represents a potential threat, and more importantly a ***perceived*** threat to Roku’s dominant device + ad business marketshare. Owners of the stock should track news of this release.

Positions:Own 200 ROKU shares @ $110.Waiting for additional acquisition news, but will likely buy ROKU 1/15 $110P within the next 60-90 days

**EDIT**: To be clear, I'm not planning selling my position in ROKU because I agree with those commenting that they have a massive head start and that Google has tons of catching up to do. However, Sabrina represents a marked change from the way previous Chromecasts have been marketed. This is a CTV device with an interface + apps. It's a direct challenger to existing devices. This can be seen as an opportunity to buy ROKU Jan puts to capitalize on a cursory understanding of the Sabrina launch...or even a ROKU buying opportunity. Sabrina's threat to Roku is that and only that right now: a threat. This is an opportunity to trade accordingly :) Happy tendies ya'll!",2020-06-26 15:39:43

# **April’s jobs report showing millions out of work looms large in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/aprils-jobs-report-showing-millions-out-of-work-looms-large-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Investors will focus on the slow reopening of the economy in the coming week, as Friday’s dismal April employment report is expect to paint a frightening picture of the most rapid job losses in history.
*****
> The unemployment rate is expected to jump from 4.4% to over 16.1% in April, the highest level since 1939, according to Dow Jones. Job losses are estimated to total 22 million, slightly below the entire number of jobs that were recovered since the Great Recession.
*****
> Strategists said the market will likely be able to look past the terrible jobs number as it has done with most bad data, showing the results of a sudden and unprecedented shutdown of the economy.
*****
> “I think people are too gloomy about the unemployment situation. I think they think the unemployment rate is going to rise through the summer,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont. “I think the unemployment rate probably peaks in May.”
*****
> Earnings season continues with dozens more companies reporting first-quarter results and talking about the impact of the virus and shutdowns on their businesses. So far, earnings appear to be down 12.7% in the first quarter, based on actual reports and estimates, according to Refinitiv. A diverse group of companies report, including Walt Disney, General Motors, CVS Health and Bristol-Myers Squibb.
*****
> But investors are watching the restarting of the economy, now underway at some level in many states. “If they go well that’s a good thing, but if in a week or two, you start to see some bad virus numbers, that’ll be a blow to confidence,” said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo.
*****
> # Best April in years
Stocks started May with a sharp decline Friday, after a 12.7% gain in the S&P 500 in April, its best month since 1987.
*****
> Sam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist, said the market had been looking forward to the latest extension of fiscal stimulus, approved by Congress, and comments from the Fed, which reaffirmed after its meeting Wednesday that it will do whatever is needed to help the economy. “Now there’s not that much to look forward to,” he said, adding the market would react negatively to any resurgence in the coronavirus outbreak.
*****
> “We had a very nice April, the best April since 1938. May is sort of a ho-hum month,” said Stovall. “It’s in the bottom half in terms of average price change, slightly below average in terms of frequency of an advance. … Just looking at last year, May tends to digest April’s gains.” The S&P 500′s April gain was its best for the month in 82 years.
*****
> # Virus economy
Economists and market strategists have been tracking the progress of the virus state by state, watching hospitalization rates, new cases and recoveries for clues on how quickly the economy might be able to restart. The economy is expected to have plunged into a deep recession in the second quarter, contracting by 35% or more, after a 4.8% decline in the first quarter.
*****
> Stanley said he expects the unemployment rate to be a better-than-consensus 11.6% in April before it rises again in May. “This is all a stab in the dark,” he said.
*****
> “I think it’s not going to come down as quickly as it went up,” said Stanley. “But I do think you’re going to see steady improvement. I think you’re going to see millions of people brought back into the payrolls for several months in succession. I think we can get out of the double digits [unemployment] by the end of the summer.”
*****
> Some workers are expected to return to their company payrolls as a result of the small business-focused Paycheck Protection Program, which encourages companies to keep workers on their payroll and bring back those who were cut. But that may not show up until May or June as a factor in the jobs data, Stanley said.
*****
> Millions more are expected to have filed for unemployment claims in the week ending May 2, on top of the 30 million who filed in the previous six weeks. Economists say with such big unprecedented numbers, it is difficult to predict the unemployment rate since some people may have been temporarily unemployed and expect to return to work.
*****
> But regardless, the number could be a shocker even though the market has shrugged off the big numbers of jobless claims and focused instead on the virus curve flattening.
*****
> “I think it could spook people,” said Schumacher. “In the markets, we’ve been watching the weekly claims, but everybody knows what unemployment is.”
*****
> Stanley said he is also watching Tuesday’s ISM nonmanufacturing data, a look at the services sector during April. A cross section of March data shows it was the services sector that took the biggest hit in the shutdowns, and it’s unclear how quickly it can recover.
*****
> “There are people who will go and do things as soon as they’re allowed to, and there are people who are going to stay home for a month or two longer,” he said. “I do think expecting we’re going to pack 100,000 people into a football stadium in September is way too optimistic.”
*****
> Stanley said some of the steep drop in consumer spending in March was the result of consumers stopping spending on health care, including elective surgery. That actually is an area that can bounce back quickly once the health care system is up and running for non virus related treatments.
*****
> # A new 20-year bond
The Treasury could announce its new 20-year bond on Wednesday, when it discloses its quarterly refunding requirements, Schumacher said. He expects about $21 billion of the new 20-year to be issued in the second quarter.
*****
> The amount of Treasury debt is expected to grow in the second quarter to help fund the growing deficit, made bigger by the trillions the government is spending to combat the virus.
*****
> “The supply announcement we think is significant because you’re going to see large auction increases, not just for one month but set in motion for many months to come,” said Schumacher. He expects Treasury to announce $330 billion in notes and bonds in the refunding for the second quarter, up from $240 billion in the first quarter.
*****
> Treasury bill issuance is expected at $1.9 trillion in the second quarter but Schumacher expects that to fall to $260 billion in the third quarter. The bills were used to give the Treasury cash to pay for emergency programs and more of that debt will move to long term debt.

# US Manufacturing Sector Has Entered a Deep Recession

> It is a foregone conclusion that the US economy has entered recession, led by the consumer, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the US economy based on gross domestic product (GDP). The collapse of consumer spending was evident in March personal consumption expenditures data released on Wednesday that showed a record 7.5% month-over-month drop in consumer outlays. It would have been worse if we weren’t stocking our refrigerators and pantries.

> The manufacturing sector is also contracting sharply, not surprisingly given the business shutdowns that began in March. Investors had a glimpse of the extent of the hit to manufacturing in the business investment component of first quarter GDP, which revealed a sharp 8.6% annualized decline, durable goods orders for March, which fell 14.4%, and Markit’s preliminary Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing in April that came in at 36.9, a level consistent with a severe recession.

> Today’s Institute for Supply Management (ISM) PMI for manufacturing—the so-called official PMI—provided more evidence of the depth of the manufacturing downturn. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the headline index fell 7.6 points to 41.5, better than Bloomberg’s consensus forecast of 36, but a level consistent with prior recessions.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ISM-Chart.png?ssl=1))**

> But that’s the good news. Peeling back the onion in this report reveals that the headline number was inflated by the supplier deliveries component. Normally, lengthening supplier delivery times reflect strong demand, which prevents suppliers from keeping up. However, in this environment, it reflects supply chain disruptions from lockdowns around the world related to COVID-19.

> The new orders and employment components of the report, which both fell more than 15 points to around 27, are better indicators of where manufacturing activity in the US is right now. The new orders number just missed the December 2008 level of 25.9, while the employment component hit its lowest level since 1949, putting the slump into proper perspective.

> “The more forward-looking components of the ISM report clearly indicate the manufacturing sector is in the midst of one of the sharpest contractions ever,” said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “Given the close relationship between manufacturing activity and corporate profits, the 25% cut to S&P 500 earnings estimates for 2020 that we’ve seen since March 1 is probably not enough.”

> The ISM report points to a sharp upcoming drop in capital investment and a huge hit to earnings in the second quarter—potentially down 40% year over year (FactSet consensus is calling for a 38% year-over-year decline in S&P 500 earnings).

> Looking ahead, while the economic impact of the global lockdowns has been severe, we continue to be reassured by developing plans to reopen the economy, progress toward treatments and vaccines, and the resolve of Americans to get through this. We continue to expect a very strong rebound in manufacturing and the broad economy later this year.

# Global Central Banks All In

> The Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) all met in the last week and while the show of power was minimal compared to recent weeks, they collectively reasserted their resolve to do whatever is necessary to support the global economy through the COVID-19 economic crisis. Rates are being held about as low as they can go, significant new programs to enhance market liquidity and support lending are in place, and, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, asset purchases have accelerated. In fact, with April not yet completed, central bank assets have risen over $3 trillion, the biggest two-month jump on record.

> “The central bank response to COVID-19 has been fast, effective, and built to impress,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “And the market is seeing it. It’s no coincidence that the market bottomed the day after the Fed rolled out a wide range of new programs addressing key areas of market and economic disruption.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Blog-Chart-20-04-30.png?ssl=1))**

> Overview of Recent Central Bank Activity

> The Fed concluded its most recent two-day meeting on Wednesday, April 29. Prior to the meeting the Fed had expanded its program supporting municipalities by lowering the minimum size of the city or county to qualify. The Fed left its target rate unchanged at 0 – 0.25%. Through its policy statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments, the Fed signaled that it is unlikely to remove its extraordinary policy support anytime soon, and we believe the Fed may hold its policy rate near zero into 2022. Asset purchases are currently open-ended and have expanded to include investment-grade and high-yield corporate exchange-traded funds.

> The BOJ met on Monday, April 27 and announced that it would lift its cap on buying government bonds, making purchases open ended, and triple the size of its corporate bond commercial debt purchases.

> The ECB met on Thursday, April 30 and announced new refinancing operations and that it would ease conditions on long-term loans to banks, encouraging banks to increase lending.

> With interest rates near zero, all major central banks have been expanding their economic support through new programs and increased asset purchases. Central bank are showing that in a time of crisis, their policy response is not limited to setting policy rates or even bond purchases. The expanded activity has all but eliminated the idea that the central banks are out of ammunition, both now and looking forward. There will come a time when these programs will end, balance sheets will unwind, and rates will rise. But until that time, central banks have shown that even prudent support in a time of economic distress is only limited by their imagination, keeping the old investing maxim “Don’t fight the Fed” alive even in an age of zero rates.

# Typical May Trading: A Month of Transition with Negative Predisposition

> Once again it is that time of the year where we increasingly see and hear “Sell in May.” But when exactly in May is the “best” time to sell? Based upon the last 21 years of data, the best time could be early in May. The month has opened well, on average, recently with strength on the first trading day and on the second trading day for the most part. Afterwards, DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all tend to drift sideways to lower until around May’s sixteenth trading day or so. It is on this day the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 begin to rally to finish the month. Beware though, this late-May rally typically fizzles before it can exceed the highs reached earlier in the month.

# This is Still an Election Year

> We have all been rather preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic, market volatility and our individual situation. Meanwhile there is still a U.S. Presidential Election taking place this year. And folks are beginning to wonder what the next political alignment might be and the ramifications that alignment has had on the market historically.

> Six possible political alignments exist in Washington: Republican President with a Republican congress, Democratic congress or split Congress; and a Democratic President with a Democratic Congress, Republican Congress or split Congress. Data presented in the chart below begin in 1949 with the first full presidential term following WWII.

> Election years are traditionally up years. Incumbent administrations shamelessly attempt to massage the economy so voters will keep them in power. But sometimes overpowering events occur and the market crumbles, usually resulting in a change of political control.

> Republicans won in 1920 (DJIA -32.9%) as the post-war economy contracted and President Wilson ailed. The Democrats came back during the 1932 (-23.1%) Depression when the Dow hit its lowest level of the 20th century. A world at war and the fall of France jolted the market in 1940 (-12.7%), but Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term. Cold War confrontations and Truman’s historic upset of Dewey held markets down through the end of 1948 (-2.1%). Recently the Great Recession and bear market of 2008 (-33.8%) helped put Obama and the Democrats back in the White House.

# 10-Day Advance/Decline Lines Running Hot

> The gains in the first half of the week lifted every sector but two—Utilities and Financials—above their 50-DMAs. Meanwhile, Health Care had even touched overbought territory (over 1 standard deviation above its 50-day) earlier in the week, making it the first sector to be overbought since late February.

> When it comes to another measure we monitor, the 10-day advance/decline line, conditions are more broadly appearing overbought. The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average number of daily advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last 10 trading days. Very high readings suggest that things have gotten extended in the very near term and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low reading suggest the opposite.

> The 10-day A/D lines for sectors have been pretty strong recently indicating broad participation in the rally, but this has led these readings to become elevated indicating conditions may be running a bit too hot in the near term. Outside of the defensive sectors like Consumer Staples, Utilities, and Real Estate, every sector's 10-day A/D line has been in overbought territory at some point over the past week. The same can also be said for the 10-day A/D line for the S&P 500. We'd note, though, that while A/D lines are extended, they're not at extreme levels seen at other points over the past year.

#**DISCUSS!**

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/wallstreetbets?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Tuesday, March 3rd, 2020! :)**",2020-03-03 14:14:37
"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 2nd, 2020",0.95,"Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week and month ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 2nd, 2020.

# **Stock rout may deepen in the week ahead as coronavirus impact starts to show up in economic data  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/28/stock-rout-to-deepen-as-coronavirus-impact-starts-to-show-up-in-data.html)**
*****
> Stock investors just experienced one of the nastiest weeks in history that recorded the S&P 500′s fastest correction on record, but hold on tight, the market might have more room to fall as the coronavirus damage starts to creep into upcoming economic data, analysts warned.
*****
> Major U.S. stock averages suffered their worst week since the financial crisis as fears about the coronavirus disrupting the global economy scared investors away from risk assets. However, stocks might still be searching for a bottom next week when investors grapple with a slew of economic data potentially dragged down by the outbreak.
*****
> The Institute for Supply Management will release its manufacturing gauge on Monday. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve will publish its latest Beige Book on Wednesday, which will detail anecdotal information on current economic conditions. Many expect U.S. manufacturing to have taken a hit from the coronavirus.
*****
> “Look out for ISM surveys and Beige Book for early signs of COVID-19 impact,” Michelle Meyer, Bank of America’s head of U.S. economics, said in a note Friday. “It will take time for the ‘hard’ economic data to show the impact but we are already seeing evidence in early economic indicators.”
*****
> Weekend action?
> The outlook for the week could be changed this weekend by coronavirus headlines or by some sort of intervention by central banks. Expectations are rising on Wall Street that there could be some potential move from the Federal Reserve to get ahead of what could be another rough week.
*****
> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank is monitoring the coronavirus and pledged action if necessary. Meanwhile, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh recommended the Fed act as quickly as Sunday before the markets reopen. The market is already pricing in a 100% chance of at least one rate cut at the Fed’s March policy meeting.
*****
> Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, is worried about the cascading effect of coronavirus hitting upcoming economic data points. “ISM manufacturing is going to be widely scrutinized,” he said.
*****
> The ISM manufacturing index rose to a reading of 50.9 last month, the highest level since July (Any reading above 50 signals expansion.) Bank of America expects ISM manufacturing to pull back to 50.0 and said Fed Beige Book may provide “early insight” into the U.S. economic impact from the deadly virus.
*****
> Cutting forecasts
> Next week, investors will also likely grapple with more warnings from major companies about broken supply chains and easing demand due to the outbreak.
*****
> Apple, Microsoft, Nike and United Airlines have all sounded alarms that they will not meet their earnings and revenue guidance because of the virus.
*****
> Wall Street strategists this week were quick to slash their forecasts on corporate earnings and the stock market. Barclays sees the S&P 500 to end the year at 3,000, down from a previous forecast of 3,300. The bank also expects a 2% drop in profits this year. Meanwhile, Goldman said it sees zero earnings growth for American companies in 2020.
*****
> To be sure, some believe the steep stock rout has gone too far too fast, betting on at least a small rebound.
*****
> “The level of panic has become very extreme and the level of downside price movement is pretty extreme. All of that is to me more of a sign that we are getting closer to the beginning of the end of it,” Paulsen said.
*****
> Another source of support could come from the Trump administration, where officials are discussing tax cuts, among other economic reactions, as one option to make up for the economic impact of the coronavirus, the Washington Post reported Friday.
*****
> Still, investors will have to be on edge for a while now with more virus headlines, as well as the key Super Tuesday Democratic primaries. Some notable investors including “bond king” Jeffrey Gundlach blamed the rise of Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders for helping accelerate massive sell-off.

# Gauging Potential Economic Impact of Covid-19

> The coronavirus outbreak—or Covid-19 —has caused significant market volatility over the past week. Our approach as always is to focus on economic fundamentals first, but the uncertainty around the scope of the outbreak has made it very difficult to assess potential impact. The situation clearly is unsettling for investors as more cases are reported across Europe and Asia, and the first case of community transmission has been reported in the United States. As this was written, the S&P 500 Index was 10% below its February 19 all-time high.

> “The Covid-19 outbreak continues to significantly disrupt economic activity in China and throughout Asia,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Given that China is such a big component of many global supply chains, we will almost certainly see weaker economic data globally over the next several months.”

> Even as the situation remains fluid and very uncertain, we want to provide some sense of the potential U.S. and global economic impact.

> **China**: If virus containment holds in China, which is our base case, we could see something like a 3–4 percentage point impact to Chinese economic growth in the first quarter—possibly 2–3% gross domestic product (GDP) growth rather than 5–6%—followed by a much more modest hit in the second quarter. We think we would see a return to trend growth by the third quarter of 2020. This scenario would put China’s 2020 GDP growth below the current 5.6% Bloomberg-tracked consensus, shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, and the Chinese government’s previous 6% annual target. In other words, China’s GDP growth in 2020 could end up closer to 5% than 6%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ.png?ssl=1))**

> United States: At this point, our base case is that any economic disruption in the United States may be modest and short-lived, as we expect domestic efforts at containment to be more successful and have less economic disruption than in China. The outbreak may trim 0.25–0.5% from U.S. GDP over the next couple of months due to global supply chain disruption, falling export demand, and decreased tourism. If evidence emerges over the next month or so that the virus is being contained successfully, as we expect, the economic impact would likely be at the better end of that range (0.25%). In that scenario, damage to business and consumer confidence would be limited, setting the stage for a potential second-quarter rebound. We believe our 1.75% U.S. GDP growth forecast may still be achievable.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ2.png?ssl=1))**

> **Global**: In the short-term, the collective hits to global GDP from China, South Korea, Japan, and Italy—the countries where the outbreak impact has been greatest to date—may comprise 0.2–0.3% of global GDP. Our latest global GDP forecast of 3.5% from our Outlook 2020 publication is probably a bit too high in light of the latest news. We expect to update or reaffirm our economic forecasts once we have more clarity around Covid-19 impact in the weeks ahead.

# Can the Market Bottom on a Friday?

> It's often said that equity markets can't bottom on a Friday. One of the reasons for this line of thinking is that during a market downturn, no one wants to hold onto or bid up equities into a weekend for fear of further bad news. It may just be a matter of semantics, but based on that line of reasoning, the more accurate way to phrase it would be that markets can't bottom on a Thursday or rallies can't begin on a Friday. However you want to think about it, the chart below shows the number of times the closing low of a 10%+ correction has occurred on various weekdays.

> Of the 97 S&P 500 corrections since 1928, the day of the week that has marked the low close of a 10%+ decline the least frequently is actually Wednesday with only 10. Behind Wednesday, Friday has been the second most infrequent day of the week for a bottom (15), and Thursday is the only other day of the week where the S&P 500 has made a low on a closing basis less than 20 times. The days of the week where the S&P 500 most frequently bottoms are Monday and Tuesday with 26 and 28, respectively.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022820-10-Corrections.png))**

> Regarding bear markets (20%+ declines), the trend is very similar. Bear markets have been the least likely to end on a Wednesday or Friday and most likely to end on a Tuesday.

# Dividend Stock Spotlight: S&P 500's Highest Yielders From The Sell-Off

> Given the lower prices of stocks, dividend yields have been on the rise over the past couple of weeks. The dividend yield of the S&P 500 now stands at 2.12% which is the highest since June 3rd of last year when it reached the same level, but only stayed there for a single day. Prior to that, yields were only higher during the Q4 2018 sell-off through February of 2019. At the beginning of the current sell-off on February 19th, the S&P 500's yield was 26 bps lower at 1.86%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Div-yield-sp.png))**

> Of the individual stocks in the index, there are now 81 stocks that have dividend yields of 4% or more. That compares to only 64 at the beginning of the sell-off. In the table below, we show the 25 highest yielders of the S&P 500 as well as the price change and change in the dividend yield since the 2/19 record high. As shown, there is only one stock, Macy's (M), that yields over 10% at the moment. This major retailer has fallen out of favor in the past few years but the stock has gotten crushed since the 2/19 market peak having fallen just under 21% in that time. That decline has raised the dividend yield by 2.44 percentage points, but there is one other stock that has seen its yield increase by even more. That stock is Occidental Petroleum (OXY), the second-highest yielder in the index (9.93%). Being an Energy name, OXY has fallen the most dramatically (-29.05%) since 2/19 of all the highest yielders.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Highest-Yielding-table1.png))**

> While there is a lot of overlap, in the table below we show the stocks that have seen their dividend yields rise the most as stocks have declined since 2/19. Again OXY and M top the list. While no other stocks have seen their dividend yields increase by more than 2 percentage points, there are another 17 who have risen by at least 1 percentage point. Notably, two cruise line stocks, Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) find themselves on this list. Carnival (CCL) now yields 6.28% while Royal Caribbean (RCL) yields 4.05%.

# The Biggest Losers (and a few winners)

> It is no secret that energy stocks have gotten crushed this year, and the list of the 25 worst-performing stocks in the Russell 1000 since the previous record close on February 19th is a prime example of this. Seven energy stocks find themselves on this list, two of which, Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and Kosmos Energy (KOS), take up the number one and two spots having fallen 45.73% and 41.95%, respectively since 2/19. CHK had already been weak headed into the broader market sell-off with a YTD loss on 2/19 over 40%; the past week has added fuel to the fire as it is now down 68.5% YTD. Continental (CLR), Centennial Resource Development (CDEV), Transocean (RIG), and Apergy (APY) are other energy stocks that were down 20% or more on the year headed into this sell-off, and each one has fallen another 20%+ since the 19th. While most of the other biggest losers since 2/19 had already been down on the year, there are some that have seen their gains in 2020 get erased due to this sell-off like Nutanix (NTNX), Qurate Retail (QRTEA), Anaplan (PLAN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Chemours (CC), and CommScope (COMM). Some other notable losers of this group have been those heavily reliant on travel like American Airlines (AAL) and the cruise line stocks like Norwegian (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL).

> Given how breadth has been over the past week, it may not come as any surprise that since the February 19th high there are only 18 stocks of 1000 in the Russell 1000 index that are higher. Four of those are up less than one percent. In the table below we show all of these stocks. Given the sell-off has centered around coronavirus fears, it is sensical that a coronavirus vaccine developer Moderna (MRNA) is the best performing stock since 2/19. What is amazing is there was not much momentum with this name headed into the sell-off. As of 2/19, the stock was actually down 3.27% year to date, but as the Covid-19 saga has moved along it is now up well north of 30% on the year. A few other health care names like Regeneron (REGN) and Gilead (GILD) have also benefited from the coronavirus.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Best.png))**

> The histogram below shows the distribution of performance of Russell 1000 stocks since 2/19. As mentioned above, there are very few stocks in the index that are up since the 2/19 high. The highest share of stocks are down between 10% and 15% while the next highest share are down between 5% and 10%. Of the worst decliners, there are 75 stocks that have fallen over 20%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/hist.png))**

> Looking at the individual sectors, again Energy was extremely weak even before equities sold off. On 2/19, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1000 in that sector was down 15.6% YTD. While they hadn't tipped into the red yet, Consumer Staples were only up 1 bp.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/YTD-of-219.png))**

> Since the 2/19 high for the US equity market, the average stock in the Russell 1,000 is down well over 10%. The average Energy stock is down the most at -21%, followed by Communication Services and Technology at -13%. Consumer Staples stocks have performed the best with an average decline of 8.9%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Since-219.png))**

> This leaves every sector down year-to-date. Utilities have generally outperformed only falling 2.3%, but the sector is sitting on a loss nonetheless. Of the worst sectors, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Materials, and of course Energy have fallen 10% or more.

# Global Equity Benchmarks Distance From YTD Highs

> The recent equity sell-off has clearly been global in nature as concerns of a global pandemic rise. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the way equities have sold off recently is that the country that has been hardest hit by the virus is closer to its YTD high than any other major global equity benchmark. The chart below shows the distance that each major global equity benchmark has declined relative to its YTD high. China's Shanghai Composite is down just 4.45%, which is better than any other country shown. Sure, you could argue that the Chinese government is manipulating the market and prohibiting investors from selling, but even the ETF that tracks the CSI 300 (ASHR) is down less than 6%, so anyone could go in and trade at these levels. Manipulated or not, the numbers are the numbers.

> At the bottom of the list, Brazil's Ibovespa index is down more than any other country at 11.6% and that country has only reported one confirmed case so far. With respect to US indices, the Russell 2000 is down the second most of any major global benchmark (-9.19%), while the Nasdaq is down the fourth most at 8.68%. Even the S&P 500 is down close to 8%. These weak US readings come in a backdrop where there have only been 57 confirmed cases and all but a couple are instances where Americans contracted the virus outside of the United States and have been brought to the US under quarantine.

# Just Four S&P 500 Stocks Up This Week

> There's still another day left in the week, but unless things improve on Friday this will go down as one of the worst weeks for US equities in history. Since WWII, there have only been four other weeks where the S&P 500 was down more than 10% in a given week. On a related note, there are also only four stocks in the entire S&P 500 that are positive for the week! Leading the way higher, Regeneron (REGN) is up a healthy 7.1% while Gilead (GILD) is up just over 4%. Behind these two, the only other stocks that are higher now than they were at last Friday's close are Clorox (CLX) and CME Group (CME).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022720-Biggest-Gainers.png))**

> On the downside, there are a lot more losers, but in the interest of space, below we have only listed the 17 stocks in the S&P 500 that are down over 20% this week alone. Looking through the names on the list, the cruise lines are well represented with Royal Caribbean (RCL), Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH), and Carnival (CCL). Besides these names, American Airlines (AAL) is down 26%, while Live Nation (LYV) is down 22.2%.

> One thing we've heard a number of people argue the last few days is that some of the weakness this week is related to the increasing likelihood that Bernie Sanders wins the Democratic nomination. If that's the case, why is not a single one of the worst-performing stocks from the Health Care sector, and why is the Health Care sector the third best performing sector this week and one of just four that is not down 10% so far this week?

> **Arconic (ARNC)** – Arconic missed estimates by a penny a share, with adjusted quarterly earnings of 53 cents per share. Revenue came in shy of Wall Street predictions. The maker of engineered metals products saw a 1% improvement in organic revenue on factors like favorable pricing and raw materials costs, partially offset by some weakness in its automotive and commercial transportation markets. Arconic also said it would complete its planned split of its aerospace components and aluminum rolling businesses into two companies on April 1.

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Monday, January 27th, 2020! :)**",2020-01-27 13:23:18
"Stock Market Week Ahead for the trading week beginning January 27th, 2020",0.98,"Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 27th, 2020.

# **After virus scare, markets look to Fed rate policy to keep stock rally going  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/24/after-virus-scare-markets-look-to-fed-rate-policy-to-keep-rally-going.html)**
*****
> With stocks coming off their first losing week of the year, investors will be looking for the Federal Reserve to soothe markets by reaffirming its position that interest rates will be low for a long time into the future.
*****
> The outbreak of the coronavirus in China in the past week took the steam out of a market that has been repeatedly rallying to new highs since December. The S&P 500 fell just about 1% for the week, amid fears the virus could lead to slower growth not only in China, but across the globe.
*****
> Those concerns could continue to spook markets in the coming week, but stocks should be buffeted by the Fed’s anticipated commitment to low rates and its current Treasury bill buying program. The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to emphasize that the Fed remains on a neutral policy path and that would only change if there was a significant change in the economic outlook.
*****
> There are also some major earnings reports, including from Apple, which hit an all-time high Friday morning before closing lower with the broader market. It could have a big impact on sentiment and help influence trading across the technology sector.
*****
> Stocks were choppy in the past week, and Treasury yields have been sinking on worries about the new virus. The 10-year yield sunk to a Nov. 1 low of 1.68% and investors drove gold prices higher in a flight-to-safety trade.
*****
> “It’s overshadowing everything, and what the market is looking for is that the Chinese are containing it, and the spread is minimal,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “The derivative of all of this is what does it do to growth? Traders and investors are hoping the stimulus that has been introduced into the Chinese economy is going to take hold, and this is not going to halt that turnaround.”
*****
> Krosby said the market has been looking for an excuse to pull back. The S&P 500 ended the week at 3,295, off 1%, but it is still up about 2% for the year so far.
*****
> “You could see going into the weekend the 10-year Treasury yield is down, gold is higher, the market is in a text book defensive state,” said Krosby. “We had a market that was poised for a bout of profit-taking and this is it.”
*****
> # Earnings roll out
> There are more than 135 S&P companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, with a heavy focus on technology, industrials and consumer stocks. Apple reports Tuesday, and Microsoft and Facebook are Wednesday. Boeing and General Electric report Wednesday, while McDonald’s releases results Wednesday. On Friday, big oil reports with ExxonMobil and Chevron expected.
*****
> Earnings reports so far have been mostly better than expected, with 68.2% of companies beating earnings per share estimates, according to Refinitiv. Earnings are expected to be down about a half percent for the fourth quarter, based on actual reports and estimates of companies yet to report.
*****
> “Coming into any earnings season with stocks at all time highs is fraught with peril,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “It’s precarious because you have the opportunity for outsized moves if you miss earnings, revenues or guidance.”
*****
> Hogan said companies may be able to give a better indication of the future, now that there’s a first phase trade deal between the U.S. and China. He said markets will also be looking for guidance from China and elsewhere on whether the virus appears to be containable or not.
*****
>#  Fed is big story but won’t say much
The Federal Reserve is not likely to say much has changed in its outlook, except that it’s last three interest rate cuts may have helped the economy and financial conditions.
*****
> “The big news is just talk on the balance sheet. I think that’s going to be the key messaging,” said Jim Caron, portfolio strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “I think the data has been okay. There’s really nothing new there. The only thing that’s really new or interesting is going to be what’s going on with the balance sheet.”
*****
> The Fed has been buying about $60 billion in Treasury bills each month to expand its balance sheet, ending a program where it was shrinking the balance sheet. The Fed is adding reserves to end a problem in the repo market, which is basically the plumbing of the financial markets where institutions go to get short term cash.
*****
> Many traders believe the program is adding liquidity to markets, and therefore driving investors into stocks.
*****
> Mark Cabana, head of short rate strategy at BofA Securiteis, said the Fed is not changing its benchmark fed funds target rate, but the fixed income market has been expecting the Fed to make a technical adjustment to another rate. He said the fed funds rate, trading at about 1.55%, has come to the lower end of the Fed’s target range of 1.5 to 1.75%.
*****
> For that reason it is likely to raise the interest rate on excess reserves by five basis points. “The intent is to affirm the bottom end of the Fed’s target range, ” he said.
*****
> Besides the technical move, they “may be will provide a little more guidance on what it would take to vote rates one way or the other,” he said.
*****
> # Economic data
> There’s an important data calendar in the coming week, including the first look at the fourth quarter’s gross domestic product on Thursday. Personal income and spending data is Friday, and that includes the personal consumption expenditure inflation deflator, watched by the Fed.
*****
> New home sales could continue the string of positive news in housing, when they are released Monday, and there are durable goods Tuesday.

# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months

> Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979—just the sixth best month for that benchmark.

> A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February’s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**

# Solid January Starts Not Rare, February Could Be Tepid

> Bullish sentiment is running high and why not. A new decade has begun, January has been bucking the recent trend of volatile performance and the market is trading at or near all-time record highs. Big round numbers like 29000, 3300 and 9000 are also emotionally satisfying. Our Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days indicators were both positive and the market is well on its way to completing a historically bullish January Trifecta. A positive January Barometer is all that remains to complete the January Trifecta.

> As of yesterday’s close DJIA was up 2.3% year-to-date. S&P 500 was up 2.79% and NASDAQ stood at 4.44%. Although these gains are above average, they are actually not all that uncommon by the thirteenth trading day of the New Year. Since 1901 (119 years), DJIA has been up 2.3% or more on the thirteenth trading day 33 times before this year. DJIA’s largest gain on the thirteenth trading day was 11.4% in 1976 (+17.9% for the full-year). S&P 500 has equaled or exceeded 2.79% on the thirteenth trading day 26 times since 1930 while NASDAQ has bested 4.44% 15 times since 1971. Depending on index, gains equal to or greater than this year come about approximately once every 3.3 to 3.6 years. 2012 was the last election year where all three indexes were up more on the thirteenth trading day than this year.

> In the following Seasonal Patten Charts of DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ, we compare 2020 (as of yesterday’s close) to All Years and Election Years. Here it is clear that the market has gotten off to a solid start with well above average gains so far. Throughout 2019, the market tracked its historical patterns quite closely which suggests some mean reversion could occur this February as the month has been historically tepid for DJIA and S&P 500.

# Another Look At Election Years

> Last week in our LPL Research blog, we took a closer look at how stocks have performed during an election year. We found that since 1940, the S&P 500 Index hasn’t been lower during an election year when an incumbent president has been up for reelection.

> We’ve had many requests to look more into election years, so we thought we’d take another look at this impactful year.

> The S&P 500’s track record for reelection years has been impressive, but its average path during these years has been quite interesting, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day. In ten reelection years since 1950, the S&P 500 on average has barely budged from February through June, before breaking out in the second half of the year.

> “Stocks actually have traded in a tight range from February through June during election years, with the big rally taking place during the second half of the year,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> From a quarterly view, the S&P 500 has historically posted modest returns in the four quarters of an election year, but the benchmark has been higher an impressive 82% of the time in the fourth quarter of all election years. That’s one of the best track records of any quarter in the four-year presidential cycle.

# Recession Watch Update

> As the economic expansion caps its first decade, we thought it’d be a good time to check on LPL Research’s leading indicators in our Recession Watch Dashboard.

> As you can see in our latest update and in the LPL Chart of the Day, the overall view hasn’t changed much. We believe we are in the later stages of this economic expansion, but we still see little threat of imminent recession. The current expansion is the longest on record, at 126 months, but the economy has grown at a slow and steady rate. We believe this measured pace, along with supportive fiscal policy, has contributed to this cycle’s continued durability.

> In the fourth quarter, the needle moved in different directions for two of our five forecasters:

> We removed the U.S. Treasury Yield Curve from On Watch status as the spread between the 3-month and 10-year yields moved back into positive territory. The spread between the 2-year and 10-year yields also climbed to an 18-month high following the Federal Reserve rate cuts. Going back to 1955, a yield curve inversion (long-term yields falling below short-term yields) has preceded each of the nine recessions. It’s important to note, however, that parts of the curve flickered between positive and inverted territory several times before the actual recession occurred.

> We added Market Valuations to On Watch status, as the S&P 500 Index trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio rose near cycle highs. The P/E ratio is now comfortably above our 2020 target of 18.75. With the S&P 500 surpassing the upper end of our year-end fair value target of 3,300, we are watching closely to see if earnings growth is strong enough to justify these elevated valuations. The low interest-rate and inflation environment continue to be strong tailwinds for market valuations.

> “We remain optimistic of continued, albeit possibly slower, economic growth in the United States in the coming year, bolstered by recent progress on the U.S.-China trade deal,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “While we continue to monitor the indicators closely, at the present time, we see only a modest chance of recession starting within the next year.”

# **It’s getting to be the best time of year for stocks, and the Dow could soon set a new high  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/the-dow-could-soon-join-other-benchmarks-at-a-record-as-strong-november-seasonality-kicks-in.html)**
*****
> As November unfolds, stocks should continue to make gains in one of the best months of the year for the market, and it’s very likely the Dow will soon join other indexes in setting new highs.
*****
> The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both traded in record territory in the past trading week, boosted by some better economic news, a better-than-expected earnings season, and hopes that trade talks will soon lead to a first-phase deal between the U.S. and China. On Friday, China said it reached a consensus with the U.S. in principle after a phone call among high-level negotiators.
*****
> Analysts say stocks could follow the seasonal trends higher, barring problems in trade talks. The market is starting the best three months of the year historically, and it has a few catalysts in the week ahead. There are a number of economic reports, the most important of which will be the ISM services PMI on Tuesday.
*****
> Third-quarter earnings season continues, with about 80 S&P 500 companies reporting, including media companies Disney and News Corp. and chipmaker Qualcomm.
*****
> # Top months ahead for stocks
> November is the third-best month for the S&P 500, which has been higher two-thirds of the time since World War II with an average 1.3% gain, according to CFRA. As good as November has been, December is even better, and as the No. 1 month, it is up 76% of the time with an average 1.6% gain. November, however, is the month that has seen the most new highs for the S&P, on a percentage basis, according to CFRA.
*****
> “Investors likely remain too skeptical on the impact of Brexit, the U.S.-China trade talks and the impeachment hearings. They’re too skeptical that the market can advance,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Many strategists say the efforts by Democrats to impeach Trump is not hurting stock prices currently but it could if there are any developments that would put his re-election in doubt.
*****
> “I think November and December are pretty much going to buck the emotional trend right now. The market is telling us it wants to go higher,” Stovall said.
*****
> Of the more than 350 S&P companies that have reported earnings, 76% beat earnings estimates, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Earnings are down about 0.8% for the quarter, based on companies that have reported already and estimates.
*****
> “This will be the 31st consecutive quarter in which actuals exceed estimates, but as much as earnings are coming in better for the quarter, they’re going down in terms of Q4 and 2020. That’s not good,” said Stovall. But he said stocks could be lifted by the end of the trade war, the impact of lowered interest rates and a possible tax cut from the White House.
*****
> “I think because the market is doing so well, it might be telling us we’re underestimating forward growth. Prices lead fundamentals,” he said.
*****
> The S&P and Nasdaq soared into record territory Friday after the October jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls grew by 128,000, much greater than expected. The number was weaker due to the strike against General Motors but not as weak as feared.
*****
> The Fed also added to positive sentiment with a rate cut on Wednesday, but the central bank went out of its way to signal a pause in policy.
*****
> “The rally is definitely broadening out. The measured move is 3,200 on the S&P 500 by year-end. In the last two sessions, we retested and spent some time above the 3,025 area. Today’s move showed some needed power, after a jobs report that was Goldilocks: It had something for everyone, not too strong to have the Fed as a headwind but strong enough to keep recession fears away,” said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. “Today’s move lends some power to the bulls.”
*****
> Redler said Apple’s performance this week was a big boost to sentiment. It ended the week up 3.7%, at a new all-time high, after strong earnings. “Traders love when Apple leads the way,” he said.
*****
> The S&P 500 was higher for a fourth week in a row, its longest winning streak since March. The S&P ended the week at 3,066, up 1.5% for the week, while the Nasdaq closed at a record 8,386, up 1.7% for the week. The Dow gained 1.4% for the week, lifted by a 301-point bounce Friday. It finished the week at 27,347, 0.2% below its all-time high of 27,398.
*****
> Historically, industrials have had the best gains on average in November, going back to 1995. Industrial stocks have been up an average 2.9%, followed by materials, up 2.7%, consumer discretionary, up 2.6% and then technology, up 2.4%, according to CFRA data.
*****
> “The cliche thing is everyone is focused on the breakout. I think the key technical event that’s been developing for weeks, it’s really been this rotation toward cyclicals,” said Robert Sluymer, technical strategist at Fundstrat.
*****
> He said he expects the Dow to break to new highs soon. “We think the market is strong through year end and well into 2020. We continue to think the market cycle low developed in late 2018. This is the next leg up in the bull market,” he said.
*****
> # What are bonds saying?
> The bond market did not respond in the same way as stocks to the jobs number. Yields were slightly higher Friday but remained near or below the level they were at just prior to the Fed rate cut on Wednesday.
*****
> “We’re actually down on the week. That tells you what the bond market thinks about the economic landscape, particularly with the jobs report. I know there’s a lot of enthusiasm about it,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group. “The bond market continues to send a very different message than the optimism in the equities market. The pace of job growth is still slowing, and this number is going to get revised multiple times. Everything is pointing to a slowdown in growth.”
*****
> The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.73% Friday afternoon, and it had been at 1.80% at the end of the prior week.
*****
> “I think it’s a bit of moderation from the sell-off we saw last week. The Fed was pretty much in line with what people were expecting,” said Ben Jeffery, a rate strategist at BMO. “I think probably stocks are viewing it as the Fed is comfortable leaving rates on hold, so many recessionary fears are a bit overblown. You could make the argument the bond market is less convinced about that.”
*****
> However, Stovall said it’s a positive for stocks when the yield on the 10-year is lower than the yield on the S&P 500, now about 2%.
*****
> “I would say another positive for stocks is historically when the dividend yield on the S&P 500 has exceeded the yield on the 10-year note. The average 12-month return for the S&P has exceeded 22%,” he said.

# Typical November Trading: First Month of “Best Months”

> November’s long-term track record has been stellar. It is the number one month of the year for S&P 500 since 1950 with an average gain of 1.6%, up 47 times in 69 years. DJIA’s record matches S&P 500, up 47 of 69 with an average gain of 1.6% although November is DJIA’s second best month. NASDAQ also averages a 1.6% gain in November (second best), up 33 times in 48 years (since 1971).

> Over the more recent 21-year period, 1998 to 2018, November’s average performance has remained solid. November has opened well with gains during the first four or five trading days depending on index. From there trading has become rather choppy with gains receding through mid-month before a low around the fourteenth trading day. At which point bullish holiday spirit has kicked in around Thanksgiving propelling all indexes to a strong rally to finish the month.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 11/1/19

> It was an extremely busy week for economic data with over 40 releases on the calendar. A vast majority came in either inline or worse relative to expectations or the previous period, while only 27% of releases came in stronger than expected or above the prior reading.

> The Chicago Fed’s National Activity Index was the first release of the week, turning back into negative territory in September. The Dallas Fed’s Manufacturing Activity index was also released on Monday and also missed estimates while shifting negative. The Conference Board’s reading on consumer confidence also softened unexpectedly as the spread between present conditions and expectations widened further. Housing data was somewhat mixed as prices slowed slightly, but pending home sales was much better than expected. Wednesday’s GDP release also came in stronger than expected with solid personal consumption. Core PCE and other inflation indicators like the Employment Cost Index were inline with expectations. Finally, Wednesday also saw the FOMC rate decision which resulted in rated cut another 25 bps, as expected. ADP’s stronger than expected employment data, preceded a solid NFP Report on Friday. Nonfarm Payrolls were expected to show 85K added jobs in the month of October which would have been a substantially weaker number than the 136K increase the prior month. Instead, actual results showed 128K added jobs, which was better than all but the highest of estimates (140K). Another focus on Friday was the Markit and ISM readings on manufacturing. Both were expected to improve from the prior month which they in fact did but by less than estimates were calling for. Markit's preliminary PMI was originally showing a stronger reading of 51.5. Instead, the final reading came in at 51.3 which was still the highest reading since April so the report wasn't entirely bad. Meanwhile, the ISM index ticked up off of last month's reading of 47.8, its lowest levels since June of 2009. This was in part thanks to the readings on new orders and employment improving. Aside from these improvements, ISM's indices—unlike Markit—are still showing contraction in the manufacturing space.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Eco-1.png))**

> The economic calendar slows down next week with around half as many releases as this week. Final durable and capital goods data and factory orders will take up the entirety of Monday’s reports. Durable goods orders are not expected to show any change from the preliminary readings, but factory orders are expected to show moderation in September. On Tuesday, we will get the services counterparts to today’s ISM and Markit manufacturing gauges. While both manufacturing readings missed, ISM’s Non-Manufacturing index is anticipated to rise to 53.5. Quarterly mortgage delinquencies and foreclose data will also be out on Tuesday. Wednesday will see more quarterly data with the Q3 preliminary releases of Nonfarm Productivity and Unit Labor costs. Following this week’s weaker Confidence report from the Conference Board, next Friday we will get further clarification on sentiment with the University of Michigan’s preliminary November data.

# Price-to-Earnings Around the Globe

> Every Wednesday, we release our Global Macro Dashboard, which tracks major data economic and market data points from 23 of the largest global economies. One stat we include is each country's P/E ratio for their respective equity markets. India continues to have the highest valuation with a P/E of 26.9. That compares to the US which is now valued at 20.1x earnings and the fifth-highest of the countries tracked. This is also higher than the average P/E for all of these countries which is 17.02. Other countries with notably high valuations include Norway, Germany, and Switzerland. Russia, on the other hand, has by far the lowest valuation of just 6.41, the only country with a P/E in the single digits.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE1.png))**

> Compared to where things stood six months and one year ago, valuations around the globe have collectively risen. The world average now stands at 17.0 versus 16.4 at the end of April and 15.1 last October. While the average multiple has increased, only 60% of the countries tracked have seen valuations increase over the last 6 months while 74% have risen over the past year. Germany's P/E has actually risen the most of these having jumped to the third-highest P/E of all countries (22.6). Six months and one year ago, Germany (EWG) actually had a below-average P/E. Multiple expansion can come in the form of higher prices and/or lower earnings, and in the case of Germany, the culprit has been weaker earnings.

> Even though it currently continues to hold the number one spot on the list, multiples in India (INDA) have actually fallen over the past six months from 30.4 down to the current level of 26.9. Given INDA has fallen over 2.5%, this lower valuation makes better sense than the jump in Germany. Similarly, in regards to the US, the ratio rising to over 20 from 19.28 comes is a result of the S&P 500's 3% gain as earnings have been pretty flat.

> Compared to one year ago, it is a similar story. As is the case now, Russia and Hong Kong have had the lowest valuations over the past six months and one year, although they have risen in that time. The valuation for most countries have risen over the past year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE-6m.png))**
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE-Y.png))**

> Summarizing in the table below, there is a bit of a mixed picture in regards to how P/E ratios have changed with performance over the past half-year and year. One would expect the ratio to increase as equities rise, but that has not necessarily been the universal case. For countries like Norway (ENOR) and Germany (EWG), valuations have risen the most in spite of equity markets that have experienced declines over the past six months (Norway's declines being the fourth-worst of the 23 countries) and only modest gains in the past year. On the other hand, Russia (RSX) has the lowest valuation of all countries despite having outperformed dramatically over the last six to twelve months. RSX has also not seen any major surge in valuation in that time as earnings have kept up with prices. Meanwhile, other countries like India (INDA), Switzerland (EWL), Taiwan (EWT) and the US (SPY) have seen this dynamic react more in line with what could be expected.

# Guidance Trends Lower

> Our good friend (and a former boss) Laszlo Birinyi used to hammer home that ""it's all about the guidance!"" when it comes to earnings reports for specific companies. That is indeed very true as investors discount stocks based on forward projections more than what they've done in the past. On the subject of guidance, this season we've been seeing a lot more companies lower guidance than raise guidance, which has resulted in a pretty big tick lower in our guidance spread reading on our Earnings Explorer page (available to Bespoke Institutional members).

> Our guidance spread reading shows the difference between the percentage of companies that have raised guidance and lowered guidance over the last three months on a rolling basis. A positive reading means more companies have raised guidance than lowered guidance over the last three months and vice versa for a negative reading. As you can see, the reading is currently at -6.48 percentage points, which is well below the historical average of -2.97. (It's notable that historically the average guidance spread has been negative, which tells us that in general companies like to under-promise and over-deliver.) The guidance spread completely tanked in the first quarter of 2019 before stabilizing and rallying back during the summer. While it hasn't been in positive territory all year, the spread did briefly get above its historical average during the Q2 reporting period in July.

> A negative guidance reading means companies are less optimistic about the future than they could be, but it's not necessarily a bearish sign for the stock market. If anything, it gives companies an easier chance at beating estimates going forward as long as the economy doesn't completely fall off a cliff. As you can see in the second chart below that extends our guidance spread reading all the way back to 2003, the current reading is hardly a negative outlier to be concerned about. The only time the spread really collapsed was in mid to late 2008 in the midst of the Financial Crisis. Want to see Bespoke's best analysis?

# The U.S. Economy Chugs Along

> Gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed for a third quarter, but the U.S. economy is still chugging along at an average pace.

> GDP grew 1.9% in the third quarter, its slowest pace of growth since the fourth quarter of 2018, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day. Still, GDP increased 2% year over year last quarter, slightly below 2.1% year-over-year average growth since the cycle started in July 2009.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/solid-consumer-spending_1.png?ssl=1))**

> The composition of growth last quarter showed U.S. consumers pulled the economy along once again. Consumer spending contributed 1.9 percentage points to the GDP increase during the quarter, while government spending added 0.4 percentage points. Housing contributed 0.2 percentage points, a nice surprise after residential investment dragged on growth for six straight quarters.

> Business spending reduced overall GDP growth by 0.4 percentage points, its biggest drag on growth since the fourth quarter of 2015. Growth in capital expenditures (capex) has stalled as U.S. companies have shelved expansion plans amid a surge in global uncertainty.

> “The economy continues to muddle through at an average pace of growth,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While we’re not surprised to see another dull quarter for capex, we’d like to see business spending eventually pick up this late in the cycle. Higher business spending could provide a boost to productivity, and higher productivity could jumpstart GDP growth.”

> Unfortunately, we don’t expect to see a material increase in capex growth until the United States and China make more significant progress on the trade front. The U.S.-China limited trade deal could provide some lift as tensions thaw, but we think companies may need to see more evidence of a larger compromise before feeling confident enough to spend.

What are the best bets on EV charging companies?,0.62,"Thought of posting this on investment reddit but they are going to tell me to research myself. Hence posting here.

So these EVs gonna need charging. I want to buy companies that help with charging. 10-15 year time I have. Can afford to lose it all. Best companies?

All I know are PLUG and BLNK. Maybe PLUG does something else I'm not sure. Plus there are other companies like Tesla that are going to take a good share probably. Who knows papa Bezos gonna get involved too.

Please don't criticize my post I have a weak heart though strong enough to have lost 40% of my portfolio in a year. Can take losses but can't take criticism.",2019-10-02 23:09:20

Ford stock will be worthless in a year - DD,0.9,"Our beloved American car company that has been around forever is a piece of absolute dog shit that will go bankrupt in the next year. Here's why

* 103 Billion in long term debt - Over the last 3 years this has increased by 12%
* 226 Billion in total liabilities - 10% increase in 3 years
* Ridiculous leverage ratio of 6
* Only 38 Billion in cash
* Profits are decreasing by about 1 billion per year
* EPS is pure shit for the sector - PE ratio of 17 is triple that of GM and Honda

&#x200B;

So what is keeping the stock value afloat?

* High dividend yield is appealing to old people who think this translates to ""secure long-term investment""
* 10 billion dollar investment in engineering new electric vehicles has investors hopes up
* Corporate restructuring - cutting costs with layoffs

&#x200B;

Why it will crash and burn

* Recent Moody's downgrade to junk bond status will likely lead to further downgrades from Fitch and S&P into junk bond status - stock value will drop significantly if this happens
* Ford has already missed the boat on developing an electric only vehicle that will catch on with consumers - Fusion Plug in Hybrids are retarded because nobody wants to plug their car into an outlet every day and still have to buy gas. They will never develop a competitive electric vehicle. Overall Ford has shown a lack of innovation in their cars
* Ford Credit has issued 91 Billion dollars worth of new car loans. Given that the number of delinquent loans in the U.S. has been steadily increasing since 2011 and is at its highest level ever - this does not bode well for the credit division of Ford
* Decreasing vehicle sales in the last year - fears of recession will further decline number of new cars sold. Nobody is going out and buying a new car if they think they will lose their job soon
* Decreasing profits and EPS in the next year will lead to further stock devaluation

&#x200B;

TLDR - Either short shares of Ford or buy puts dated for late next year/2021. This company is an overly leveraged dumpster fire

$TLRD 100%+ in a year,0.7,"TLRD's stock market price action has been acting like the company is going to go bankrupt. Yet the bond market has been trading its '22 debt at or above par recently. Recent positive news includes:

\- sale of non-core business

\- upward EPS revision

\- very detailed buyout rumor at roughly double the avg share price over the past 2 weeks: [https://twitter.com/JonathanWexler3/status/1164205831904256000](https://twitter.com/JonathanWexler3/status/1164205831904256000).

\- Michael Burry just took an activist stake (which to my knowledge, is unprecedented):  [https://fintel.io/doc/sec/1649339/000114036119015903/formsc13d.htm](https://fintel.io/doc/sec/1649339/000114036119015903/formsc13d.htm)

\- partnership with the NFL:  [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190903005193/en/Tailored-Brands-Enters-Licensed-Collaboration-NFL](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190903005193/en/Tailored-Brands-Enters-Licensed-Collaboration-NFL)  ""We are excited to work with Tailored Brands,” said Michelle Micone, Senior Vice President of Consumer Products of the National Football League, “and offer our fans something **they’ve long been asking for** through a licensing agreement with brands who continue to be recognized as **the industry leaders in men’s custom clothing**.”

This is important for several reasons.

1) The NFL is hinting there is strong market demand for this product. Marketing hasn't even begun, but by the end of this NFL season, you can expect that every fan will know about the next coming of Men's Wearhouse and JAB. This is important because all the deep value models pre-NFL-partnership had TLRD valued much higher than its current value, but **assumed decreasing sales**.

There's now a good chance that sales will actually increase in the near-future thanks to the exclusive NFL partnership, and any other partnerships that may come down the pipe. If you plug growing sales into these models, a ten bagger is not out of the question.

**Remember, 33%-50% of Americans call themselves NFL fans.**

2) Despite all the chatter on the fashion snob pockets of the internet, Men's Wearhouse and JAB are still recognized by mainstream America as the leaders in formalwear. This hints that TLRD will likely form more partnerships with major sports leagues, and they are the **only** company with enough market power and street cred to get these kinds of deals. In Warren Buffett parlance, they are growing their moat.

\---

**What about the bear case?**

\- Workplace casual is going to kill TLRD...right? Well, no. The workplace casual trend has been in play for over a decade now, and yet MW sales have had periods of significant growth throughout. This is clear evidence that the workplace is not the dominant factor in MW sales. There will always be weddings, black tie events, funerals, proms, lawyers, bar mitzvahs, etc.

\- Men's Wearhouse is lame compared to \[insert fashion snob's preferred suit retailer here\]. There are two problems with this.

First, most American men are not fashion snobs. When you subtract the population of fashion snobs from the population of American men, you still have a huge population that needs suits.

Second, Men's Wearhouse has a high-quality line of **made-in-America** suits by Joseph Abboud, who even the fashion snobs agree, have quality that stands up to the trendier suit makers. And in today's political climate, you cannot underestimate the power of made-in-America.",2019-09-09 02:12:24
Zillow Business Model 100% Dependent on Two Companies,0.92,"Ever wondered how Zillow/Trulia works?

Its a simple website aggregator that gets 95% of its data from the local MLS (Multiple Listing Service Listings) and rest from direct postings. They sell overpriced ads that most agents do buy because they simply dont work and have crappy ROI. They basically sell ads to the same agents tho provide them these listings. Go figure, a middle man for another middle man. Then when you throw Google in mix you got another middle man.

Its entirety depends on [**MLS**](http://www.mls.com/) to feed the property data and **Google** to be found online by consumers looking for these properties.

If MLS or Google ever wanted to pull the plug on the big Z will be left eating a lot of shit crumbs. These two companies have Zillow on a lifeline.

Long WMGI. DD Inside,0.83,"Wright Medical Group is a $3 billion dollar medical implant company based in Amsterdam.  Last week they beat earnings, but lowered guidance sending their stock spiraling down 22%.  See now what happened is they were selling their implants primarily through distributors with a small direct sales team to compliment.  Their distribution channels failed to deliver on Q2 sales projections for their big toe implant product called Cartiva and sales for that particular product dropped 40%.  What did Wright Medical do you ask?  They immediately pulled the plug on their distribution sales partners and are building up their direct sales force.  Now I've been part of a company in this industry that did this, and it was massively successful.  The challenge is you are basically directly competing with all of these distribution reps now, but the advantage is you have a more specialized and focused sales force.  The stock is trading at it's lowest point since May 2018.  Depending on how quickly they can ramp up this direct sales force, I'm betting this stock has seen it's floor and we'll see a nice climb back up to near $30 by year end.  Tomorrow morning I'm loading up on Feb 2020 $25 calls.  That is unless somebody on here can talk me out of it.",2019-08-12 04:58:49

I think people give them a bad rep as products only for rednecks but here in NYC I've been seeing their stuff more and more among the outdoors crowd because the shit they make is just GOOD. Full stop. The outdoors market is huge and they have a ridiculously strong brand. The growth potential is there so I'm hella bullish.

Short $PZZA: Shaq excitement wearing off,0.87,"Two weeks ago this was posted: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b48mbb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b48mbb/shaq_joining_board_of_directors_of_pzza_get_ready/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

WSB was right, and $PZZA did have a good spike after the news, going from $47 up past $53 at the end of last week. This week, they've been back on their usual downtrend, falling to $52.10 at close Friday, having touched as low as $50.50 Thursday afternoon. $PZZA's been on a general disappointing downtrend in the last year, and it's likely to continue. I take last week's sink in prices as indication that the spike was indeed excitement about Shaq, and that as it wears off the price should settle back down to where it was, around $50 or lower.

My position: I opened a short when the Shaq spike happened on the 22nd, but pulled the plug two days later when it became clear the surge wasn't over yet. Been waiting to see when/where the price would top, and I think last Friday was the tippy top. I'm considering opening another short position in $PZZA next week, depending on conditions Monday morning.

Potentiometer Short play: Ford. Carbon Monoxide leaks in SUVs,0.83,"People have been complaining about getting sick in their Ford SUVs. Recent tests on driver shows signs of carbon monoxide poisoning. High levels of toxicity which is not good, it can actually be deadly. **THIS IS NOT NEW, THE INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR 2 YEARS** Now there are new pushes most recently by Bloomberg. So first of all some recent news story on the issue: 

https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-ford-explorer-owners-say-suvs-making-them-sick/

Here’s an old link from 2017. Many cop patrols use Ford Explorer and its not so good when a cop is being exposed to carbon monoxide. Several officers were hospitalized. 

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ford-rushes-repair-police-suvs-more-departments-raise-carbon-monoxide-n791031

Unlike in a home basement leak of carbon monoxide, this is not *as* bad since you don’t sleep and live in your car. It’s still pretty bad because the long commutes can add up fast. Carbon monoxide is hard to detect without proper instrumentation. A person can not simply tell they are in the presence of it since it’s an odorless gas. There are debates on whether accidents have been directly caused in these SUV’s due to carbon monoxide poisoning however it’s very possible they were. CO can cause anything from dizziness to loss of consciousness to permanent brain damage depending on exposure. I’m not saying the issue on hand is that big but we don’t know. See below for more info on CO poisoning and symptoms. 

https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carbon-monoxide/symptoms-causes/syc-20370642

Why Short Ford? This news will now start to develop more and more as the owners push for answers. Many owners are not going to want to drive their cars. Though the investigation is and has been underway it looks to be a boiling shitstorm. Ford will likely have to eventually admit to their fault which at the moment there is just an *alleged* monoxide leak because they even tried to fix the issue before but have failed to do so properly. If and when Ford makes the announcement. They will have to recall millions of explorers but that’s not the end of the world. Recalls happen. If the issue is just the whole near the lift gate that’s allowing CO then it’s a simply plug/patch up and you’re done, not s big deal. The worse will be the lawsuits that come along this type of a deal. There’s attorneys probably drafting up cases right now to get a class action suit going against Ford. 

Old individual lawsuit regarding same issue: https://jalopnik.com/police-officer-suffered-nerve-damage-after-carbon-monox-1819668340

Is Ford going to **TANK** on Monday? Likely not. Is this going to be their demise? Likely not. But it’s definitely a big issue that’s been brewing up too long now and somethings gotta blow with everything re-surfacing. 

TLDR: Ford SUVs had and still show signs of carbon monoxide leaks causing adverse health effects for drivers. Buy puts accordingly if you want. Buy calls to inverse wsb. Godspeed fellow autists. ",2019-03-23 00:44:42

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 4th, 2019.

# **The week ahead: Jobs report needs to silence rising worries about the economy  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/01/the-week-ahead-jobs-report-needs-to-silence-rising-worries-about-the-economy.html)**
*****
> Job growth has remained vibrant despite the slow-growing economy,and that's a trend investors are anxious to see confirmed in the February employment report on Friday.
*****
> Even with some economists expecting growth around 1 percent for the first quarter, the labor market has been strong, and economists expect to see 185,000 jobs added in February. The economy is widely expected to bounce back in the second quarter to a pace well above 2 percent, after the temporary headwinds from the government shutdown and polar vortex abate.
*****
> The jobs data tops the list of important economic news in the week ahead, particularly after a string of disappointing reports showing that both consumers and businesses have pulled back.
*****
> The stock market will pass a major milestone on Wednesday—the tenth anniversary of the day the market bottomed in 2009, when the S&P 500 hit 666. The S&P has gained more than 312 percent since that low of the financial crisis, and some analysts see the bull market continuing for at least another year.
*****
> ""We think there's further upside for this bull market to go. The age of the bull does not matter. What really matters is how healthy it is,"" said Patrick Palfrey, U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. ""Whatever the concerns, around trade tariffs, or decelerating corporate profits, we believe this bull market remains very healthy.""
*****
> The S&P 500 is taking aim at the 2,800 level, an important milestone that it has struggled to surpass in the past week. The 2,800 marker was an important level for the stock market four times in past several months, and holding above it could signal the rally could drive stocks to fresh highs.
*****
> Palfrey said investors first and foremost are looking at any information that can help them gauge how the economy is doing. ""We're looking for confirmation in the jobs report. We think the economy is doing okay. Labor participation is improving. We're going to see that continuing to inch back up,"" he said.
*****
> The Citigroup economic surprise index fell to a new 18-month low Friday, following a recent rash of disappointing reports. When economic reports come in below economists' expectations, the surprise index falls and a low number for the index is reflecting the economic slowdown.
*****
> Source: Citigroup
*****
> Goldman Sachs economists Friday said they were expecting first quarter growth of just 0.9 percent, but they raised second quarter growth to 2.9 percent.
*****
> #New home sales
> In addition to the jobs report, there is the Fed's beige book on the economy Wednesday and new home sales Tuesday. But after delayed and weaker data, it's the jobs report that matters most. The employment report is one data point that has been released as normal through the shutdown, and in the January data, there was a huge upside surprise of 304,000 nonfarm payrolls.
*****
> ""All eyes are on the job market. If businesses lose faith and they stop hiring, and job growth starts slowing, then we do have problems,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. Economists expect wages to rise by 0.3 percent and unemployment to fall a tenth to 3.9 percent, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> ""I think companies should stay steadfast in their hiring,"" Zandi said. He expects job growth of about 200,000 but notes there could be a payback for the huge amount of hires in January.
*****
> ""I think the economy is fragile, growth is below trend. It's very vulnerable. The only thing that will keep it together is if businesses keep hiring and the job market holds up, and I think it will unless the president doesn't settle with the Chinese on trade, or there's a hard Brexit or some other geopolitical event,"" said Zandi.
*****
> The Federal Reserve has paused in its interest rate hiking because of the slowing economy and concerns about financial conditions. But the Fed could move forward on rates again, if inflation begins to pick up, and for that reason the wage data in the jobs report would also be key were it to show new wage pressures.
*****
> There are a few speeches by Fed officials, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell who speaks at Stanford University Friday night at an economic conference.
*****
> Market focus will also be on the European Central Bank which meets Thursday.
*****
> ""I think people are expecting some detail about a long-term loan operation,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. The ECB is expected to allow European banks to extend the duration of some short-term loans. Chandler said the ECB could also push back on its time frame on raising interest rates, which it has said would not be until after the summer.

# Typical March Trading: Mid-Month Surge and Flat

> Over the recent 21 years March has been a solid performing month for the market. Average gains over the period range from a low of 1.29% by NASDAQ to a respectable 2.0% by Russell 2000. March has also been the #1 performing month by average performance for S&P 500 and Russell 2000 over the last 21 years. First trading day of March gains typically kick of the month, followed by choppy to slightly higher trading until around the tenth or eleventh trading day when the market tends to surge higher until around the fifteenth trading day. At this point the market tends to cool and can succumb to some end-of-quarter selling pressure.

# Bad Q4 Not A Bad Sign

> Now that the 4th quarter market debacle is behind us and solid gains have been logged in 2019 year-to-date we have taken a deeper dive into market action following Q4 losses for the three main U.S. market indices. DJIA and S&P 500 have been solid over the next for the next four quarters and the next year when Q1 is positive, but also good following all but three subsequent Q1 losses. On average up about 80% of the time for the full year with average gains around 8%. NASDAQ’s record is choppier.

Top Unusual Options Activity - 12/31/2018 - 1/4/2019,0.95,"Hello everyone!

My trading strategy is pretty simple - I keep an eye on what big money is buying, and follow them into swing plays. I keep my eye on approximately 500 trades per week, and pick out things I think are unusual.

I wanted to share this with the community!

PS: This isn't a plug, but I'm thinking of starting a free weekly newsletter with this information as well. I'd love to hear whether this information is valuable to you, and any other information you'd like to see!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**$ASHR** \- buyer of $1.5M July $22.71 calls. This is likely a bet that the trade war will be resolved by summer, and Chinese stocks will spike. UPDATE: /u/HurtByBubble pointed out that these have already been closed.

**$NVDA** \- buyer of $5.6M of March $145 calls. Someone is placing a **big** bet on NVDA being oversold going into earnings.

**$SPOT** \- buyer of $10M+  04/18/2019 $120 calls. This is a huge bet on Spotify. There could be a variety of things happening here. Either someone thinks they are going to have blowout Q1 2019 results, or they're anticipating a buyout. It has been rumored that Apple is looking at buying them.

**$BMY** \- buyer of $2M March $52.5 calls. The stock declined roughly 10% on news they were buying Celgene Pharmaceuticals. A drop will typically happen on news of an acquisition, and heavy call buying after is a bullish signal. This trade is in addition to another $1M in calls purchased on various strikes / expos.

**$IQ** \- buyer of $500,000 in February $17.5 calls.

**$CAR** \- buyer of $3.9M in January 2021 $15 puts. This is a huge out-of-the-money bet that Avis Budget Group will continue declining in the medium term. The stock is down 54% from highs earlier this year, and has earnings on Feb 26th.

**$SPY** \- buyer of $1.28M in 1/16/2019 $240 calls. Short-term bullish call on the market. This could be fueled by good trade news and the end of the government shutdown.

**$AAPL** \- buyer of $2.8M in January 2021 $120 puts. We've all read the negative news on iPhone sales. This trade is interesting because of how far out of the money it is. This gives some indication that big funds see it hitting the $120 area, from the current $148 price. UPDATE: u/[imduanereademy5isfly](https://www.reddit.com/user/imduanereademy5isfly)/ has pointed out that this may be a large fund deploying a delta-neutral strategy, and thus isn't necessarily indicative of the implied direction of Apple. 

**$PYPL** \- buyer of $2.61M in 2/01/2019 $84.5 calls. PayPal has earnings on 2/04. This looks like a bet on a run-up into earnings.

**$BAC** \- buyer of $4.1M in March $22 calls. Note that these calls were purchased on Thursday, before Powell spoke. We know what trade was made, buy not why. They could've been speculating on either positive news from Powell and also a positive earnings report. $BAC reports earnings on January 16th.

**$BUD** \- buyer of $3.4M in March $70 calls. You know what people love during a recession? Beer. They love beer.

**$IYR** \- buyer of $1.19M in January 2020 $75 puts. This is a real estate trust, someone is betting on declining house prices + sales over the next year.

**$SQ** \- buyer of $3.5M in June $65 calls. Someone is expecting $SQ to pop over 22% in the next half year.

**$SMH** \- buyer of $1.3 in February $75 calls. Big bet on this semi-conductor ETF.

**$CZR** \- buyer of $3.1M in January 2021 $12 calls. Long term play.

**$AVGO** \- buyer of $15.5M in July $250 calls. We're not entirely sure what the basis of this bullish call is, but it is a huge sum.",2019-01-06 22:44:32

Finally [out of the red today boys](https://imgur.com/gallery/sb9xseg)! A week and a half ago, I lost big on GE puts and went down 56%. I was ready to pull the plug. I sold all the shares I owned and was ready to pull all the cash out and chalk this whole trading thing up as a bad idea. While waiting on the funds to be available to transfer back into the bank account, I caved and decided to YOLO puts on the FOMC. I made some good moves and some bad moves. I sold some puts too early for losses that could've been gains and I waited too long to sell on some. If I played it smarter, I would've been up a lot more. But all in all, my portfolio lives to trade this 🐻 market next year and I got a small order of Christmas tendies out of it. Time to take a break for the rest of the year and move my cash over to another brokerage because fuck Robinhood. Next year I'll play it smarter with smaller trades and no more YOLOs.

"My take on $PLUG power, near and long term tendies, DD inside",0.97,"**TLDR**: Buy $PLUG $3 11/16 calls for tendies as Plug Power will see the results of opening new factory, developing robots to take advantage of autonomous forklifts and delivery trucks, and developing new tech to double power storage. $AMZN, $NKE, and $WMT already use their equipment (and will purchase more) and $FDX has conducted 7500mi of deliveries in the Albany area using a Plug Power powered FedEx truck. Institutional investors have doubled their positions by millions of shares and all eight of its board members have purchase shares four times since the beginning of the year.

&#x200B;

**DD**:

WSB listen up - Plug power is going to pop soon with a price target of $3.57, a 90% increase over its current price for the near term tendies. It will increase over the next quarter further as it completes its transition from research company to viable manufacturing company. I have 155 $3 11/16 calls for the near term tendies based around its 11/8 earning report, which I'll then turn over to 3/15 calls for the long term tendies where I expect it will jump yet further.

Walmart, Amazon, Nike, and FedEx have opened contracts with Plug Power for hydrogen powered forklifts and vehicles. Hydrogen power might seem lame but their niche is in industrial forklifts and local deliveries where time spent recharging is thousands of dollars a minute. Their CEO Andy Marsh has also been named to the U.S. Department of Energy Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technical Advisory Committee, giving the business the political connections it needs to succeed. Jonathan Silver, a member of the board of directors, is also a former US Department of Energy official. They are also pursuing European expansion to become an international company, where the political connections will offer them an advantage over their competitor Bloom Energy.

All eight of the board members have purchased hundreds of thousands of shares in the company four times since the beginning of the year, most recently in late August, signalling that they see a positive future for the company as it has turned around from a research company to a viable industrial and manufacturing business. Institutional investors have increased their stakes by millions of shares - Odey Asset Management Group Ltd bough an additional 2,330,000 shares increasing their stake in the company to 4,910,000 shares. Ignore the misleading title of the article and read content for a breakdown of the institutional investor increases: ([https://www.fairfieldcurrent.com/2018/09/23/insider-selling-plug-power-inc-nasdaqplug-director-sells-31343-shares-of-stock.html](https://www.fairfieldcurrent.com/2018/09/23/insider-selling-plug-power-inc-nasdaqplug-director-sells-31343-shares-of-stock.html))

This is also different than a vehicle running on LPG or other alternative fuel. The hydrogen isn't burned in the traditional sense, but is instead run through a membrane that strips the electrons from hydrogen using a catalyst and generates electricity directly from the reaction - the hydrogen then bonds with available oxygen and generates water as a byproduct. The advantage of this type of system is the reduced refueling/recharging time compared to traditional electric forklifts that are used in warehouses, and the reduced emissions compared to traditionally powered forklifts. Their systems are retrofit-capable and can be fitted to currently owned electric forklifts, reducing the overhead of purchasing all-new equipment.

They have also in-sourced the production of the membrane electrode assemblies to further reduce costs ([https://www.gasworld.com/interview-with-plug-power-ceo/2015463.article](https://www.gasworld.com/interview-with-plug-power-ceo/2015463.article)) and opened a new almost 40k SQFT factory in Rochester New York ([https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/08/15/plug-power-adds-factory-in-clifton-park](https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/08/15/plug-power-adds-factory-in-clifton-park)). They used to purchase their membranes for their equipment from their competitor Bloom Energy, and now that they are producing their own membranes they have announced two new pieces of technology - a new membrane that doubles the energy output of its fuel cell system, and their partnership with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the US DOE to develop a robotic fueling station and reduces the time needed to refuel and allows the the usage of autonomous warehouse equipment powered by its system.

Autistic DD/plug of the day: $CHK,0.67,"If CHK closes above $5 today and Monday, there could potentially be a huge squeeze. Tried to break $5 3 or 4 times previously in the last month but couldn't. With an announcement of debt reduction, along with a big ER, SP could skyrocket. If debt is reduced in any meaningful way, no chance this is only a $4-$5 stock after another solid earnings report, which is likely with the increase in NG and oil prices. 

DD: They made $9.23B in the last year with $1.1B in earnings. They've destroyed earnings each of the last 2 quarters, and last quarter had earnings of 34 cents a share, on a $4 stock. What's up with that? The only thing keeping this share price down is the amount of debt. Any progress on that end could send it much higher, and the CEO has said that the common shareholder would be rewarded this year. 

$6 and $7 calls a few months out are still cheap. Personally, Im trying to hit a homerun with some $9 August calls, but I also have September $6 which I'm extremely confident in.

Arista Network (ANET):,0.88,"**What is Arista?**

Arista Networks is a classic disruptor that has almost everything going right for it these days. Arista's cloud-based networking technology beats traditional hardware in both speed and capacity, and the world's increasing appetite for data helped the company increase revenue more than tenfold over the past six years. Arista's third-quarter report was more of the same: Sales grew more than 50% and net income more than doubled. Fourth-quarter results come out in two weeks, and management has guided for continued growth, with the top line expected to increase about 40% over last year. And about Arista's leadership: It's top-notch. Co-founder and chairman Andy Bechtolsheim is a Silicon Valley legend, founding Sun Microsystems and funding Google in its infancy. CEO Jayshree Ullal and co-founder and chief technology officer Kenneth Duda are superstars in their own right. What's more, Bechtolsheim and Ullal control about 23% of shares between them. Plug in for a long run with this innovator.

Arista Networks' fourth-quarter results continued its impressive run of growth. Revenue jumped 43% to $467.9 million, and that was slightly higher than the consensus forecast among investors for $463 million in sales. Adjusted net income soared 77% to $137.3 million, and the resulting adjusted earnings of $1.71 per share topped the $1.42 per share that most of those following the stock had expected to see.
Sales gains were well balanced across Arista's segments, with product sales jumping 41% even as the smaller but still important services division experienced stronger growth of more than 55%. Internal efficiency remained strong, with gross margin rising another 1.5 percentage points to 65.9%.

As we've seen before, Arista kept a tight rein on most of its expenses. Research and development costs jumped by half, but a decline in overhead expenses and just slight increases in sales and marketing costs helped keep operating expenses in line. That in turn helped to boost Arista's earnings by a greater percentage than its revenue gains.

CEO Jayshree Ullal was very happy with the way that the year ended. ""2017 represents a market tipping point,"" Ullal said, ""with Arista's disruptive software-driven architecture gaining mainstream acceptance as we surpassed 15 million cumulative ports of cloud networking."" CFO Ita Brennan pointed to 2017's 46% revenue jump and 70% rise in adjusted earnings per share as further marks of success for the year.

**Arista CAN keep growing:**

Arista's future remains bright. One reason why Arista had such a strong year was that business from key customer Microsoft grew even faster than the company had expected. Microsoft made up about 16% of Arista's business, and Ullal pointed both to Microsoft's own success with Azure and to Arista's Microsoft engineering team in developing use cases that appealed to users of the systems. Such collaborations with what the CEO called ""cloud titans"" will be a top priority in driving Arista's future growth.

2018 promises to be an interesting year for Arista. The company expects to enter into the 400 gigabit Ethernet market space in the coming year, and after having reached the status of market share leader in the 100 gigabit Ethernet switching industry, Arista can expect to lever its reputation among purchasers to work more closely with service providers, cloud specialty providers, and enterprise customers more broadly.

Arista's first-quarter guidance was generally in line with what investors had foreseen. A range of $450 million to $468 million in revenue was in line with the consensus forecast for $458 million, and guidance for adjusted gross margin of 63% to 65% and operating margin of 32% was generally consistent with past quarters.

Yet shareholders wanted more from Arista, perhaps through stronger projections for 2018 or further signs of accelerating growth in key product areas. In response to that disappointment, the stock dropped 13% in pre-market trading Friday following the Thursday afternoon announcement. In the long run, though, Arista Networks seems to be doing everything it can to capture a growing piece of the important networking space. Long-term investors might well see any pullback for the stock as a buying opportunity rather than a cause for concern.

**Why I’m still VERY bullish on Arista:**

It shouldn't be surprising that growth will moderate as Arista builds from its larger base. Of course, investors should also keep in mind that Arista has made a habit of underpromising and overdelivering, so I won't be surprised if this outlook proves conservative when 2018 is said and done. But it also didn't help that Arista Networks' stock price had more than tripled over the past year leading up to this report, likely tempting some skittish investors to take profits despite the continued relative strength of Arista's underlying business.

This was another strong report from Arista Networks, and contrary to what Friday's decline might indicate, long-term investors should be more than pleased with their position.

Disclosure: I am now long with roughly $3700 in Arista. Looking for exit at $305. Will add 50% more to position if drops to $238.75

They have a monopoly on the power industry in Detroit, which is important. They recently broke ground on a solar farm northeast of Detroit within the past year.

More people are moving to Downtown Detroit because it's the ""hip"" thing to do. Now I like my comfy suburban home, but some people like to buy/rent a burned out building and restore it and open an avocado toast store or something. Point is that more buildings that were previously out of commission are starting to reopen, leading to more ""net locations"" that DTE can use as customers. Plus, with the Pistons moving back downtown, they will have to supply the new stadium for both the Red Wings and the Pistons. More revenue there.

In addition, people around Metro Detroit are fiercely loyal to the Big 3. Very few people buy foreign cars (including Tesla even though they're American.) With Ford and GM expanding their plug in hybrids and full time EVs, more ""environmentally conscious"" people are going to buy those which will lead to a higher dependency on the power grid. Now not everyone will buy them, but I've seen considerably more Volts and Fusion Energis this year than in my entire life combined. 

Now, into the stock's chart. The stock peaked at 110 just a month ago, and fell down to 105. Its creeping back up to 110, and likely going to go beyond, but more likely testing the resistance at 110 again. It currently sits at 107.94, and has been green for the past two weeks. 

Power is not going away anytime soon, and I like the looks of DTE for the future. It's a slow-moving stock though, but the overall trend is upward.",2017-07-23 14:52:40

$BAH Boozy Party thread,0.79,"Anyone else get long on $BAH (Booz Allen Hamilton)? 

I got long 10 contracts calls last Friday prior to earnings released today.  Booz is raking in shit tons of ~~Federal~~ tax payer money to fund multiple projects, many of which are DOD or ""DOD"" (read: CIA) projects.  They beat on EPS and earnings, also guidance was good/better than expected.

Made about $1,290.  The link leads to two poorly merged shots, the black line in the middle is the profits, $1290, purchase at bottom, sale at top.  I was never an artist.

https://i.imgur.com/MmwaXDK.png

Booz is still a decent play today - just watch the volume, this can be a bit slow on this stock but its a solid company for the next week.

EDIT - here was my loose DD:


Booz got raised to better than expected .43¢ EPS right on Thursday. Good sign they were going to hit earnings. On top of that the Federal spending on their contracting projects has only grown since trump came in. BAH represents a cutout for classified ops, and allows some fluidity in data analysis as CIA, DIA, DOD don't have to spend money on the HR side of things. Most BAH employees are ex military, already have secret/top secret clearance plus SCI experience. Its an easy plug in for DOD to pull them for both Washington and overseas jobs. 

Basically, lots of revenue in plus high demand on the table meant likely beat and like good guidance, worth the (small) play.",2017-05-22 14:58:17

The real Nokia,0.63,"I've seen a lot of posts about Nokia. You people are, I get it, idiots that love to lose money, I know this and you know this. But lettuce pretend that I am not (in reality, I am so fuck me sideways and call me Pedro Sue). I am not saying mobile is going away but hear me out.

In my opinion (just my fairy opinion sprinkled with crack on some hummus) the only thing Nokia has is software (and mobile security). These are two important segments. However, Nokia is not the play. BlackBerry is the play. They've got better software solutions, are no longer in mobile hardware (read smartphones faggot) they instead now license out, and are pursing vehicle-2-vehicle solutions (among other IoT solutions). [That is the Internet of Things dipshit].

This was updated guidance based on Q3 results released yesterday:

""BlackBerry (NASDAQ:BBRY) posted a relatively mixed set of Q3 FY’17 results, beating market expectations on earnings amid cost cutting and a lower mix of hardware sales. However, the firm’s revenues fell short of consensus, on account of lower than expected software revenues,causing BlackBerry’s stock to close roughly 3% lower in Tuesday’s trading.That said, the outlook is improving, with the firm projecting an adjusted profit for the full fiscal year, compared to its previous guidance ofbreak-even to a $0.05 loss per share, driven by an increasingly software and services-focused revenue mix. Below, we outline some of the key takeaways from BlackBerrys earnings for the quarter.

Trefis has an $8 price estimate for BlackBerry, which is slightly ahead of the current market price. We will be updating our price estimate to account for the earnings release.

See our complete analysis for BlackBerry here

Enterprise Mobility Solutions Drive Software Growth

BlackBerrys adjusted software and services revenue stood at about $172 million, marking year-over-year growth of about 49%, excluding intellectual property licensing, which had a significant revenue contribution during Q3 FY’16.The firms enterprise mobility software remained the key driver of software sales, with 3000+ customer adds for the quarter, marking a slightly uptick over Q2.BlackBerry noted that ~80% of its software and services revenue, excluding patent licensing and professional services, is now recurring,given the firm’s transition from a sales model to a licensing model. The firm has also taken some steps tounify its various enterprise mobility and security offerings, launching the BlackBerry Secure suite earlier this month, enabling it toprovide end-to-end security solutions to businesses and governments who want to protect their mobile devices and computer systems (related: What BlackBerry Aims To Achieve With Its Latest Security Offering). BlackBerry expects its adjusted software and services revenues to grow at around 30% year-over-year in fiscal 2017, with growth outpacing the broader enterprise mobility software market in FY’18.

The relative revenue stability in the enterprise software space is giving BlackBerry headroom to expand its other software businesses such as automotive solutions and Internet of Things. Last quarter, BlackBerry stucka deal to work directly with Ford Motor Companyto expand its use of BlackBerry QNX and security software, effectively making it a Tier-1 supplier. (related: Why BlackBerrys Software Deal With Ford Is Promising) Most of the firm’s previous auto deals were done withinfotainment hardware vendors, who in turn sell products to automakers. BlackBerrys IoT business is also slowly coming to fruition. The firm’s Radar solution, which caters to the fast growing fleet management market, saw some business development activity, winninga contract with a U.S. trucking firm called Titanium Transportation in Q3. The productalso has anothersixpilot deploymentsunderway with other companies. The business model for Radar calls for a small upfront fee, with companies paying a monthly fee for monitoring and services.

Handset Business Shrinks, But Shift To Licensing Will Help Bolster Margins

Sales of BlackBerrys handsets dropped to $62 million from $220 million in Q3 FY’16, amid a weak uptake for the firm’s new Android based devices. However, the division sawgross margins improve to about 44%, with operating income coming in at $5 million, versus a lossduring the previous quarter, driven by BlackBerrys move to increasingly outsource production. Margins could improve significantly over fiscal 2018 as well, as BlackBerry largely transitions into the licensing revenue model, ending its internal hardware development and sales. (related: BlackBerry Does The Right Thing By Pulling The Plug On Handset Development)

Gross margins for licensing are expected to be significant (~90% per BlackBerry), given the low variable costs and reliance on BlackBerrys existing software assets and brand name. BlackBerry will essentially provide its secure Android software and applications such as BlackBerry Hub, while its hardware partners will take care of the design, manufacturing and marketing of the smartphones. The firm currently has deals with a hardware manufacturer in Indonesia and also with Chinas TCL, which is expected to market BlackBerry devices globally, excluding a few Asian markets.""

"Wallstreetbets, is this something useful?",0.97,"Hi. I'm a novice trader in college and longtime browser of /r/wallstreetbets.

I noticed there was quite a bit of earnings plays on this subreddit, and one of things I do first when evaluating potential earnings plays was to see to check:

Next FDA Approval Play: $OCUL,0.83,"Okay friends, here's the long and short of it. In the next week (the 24th at the latest) our good buddies at the FDA are gonna sit around a table and talk about Ocular Therapeautix, a company that is up for FDA approval for their ""ocular sealant drug"". 

Now, you probably realized that the stock went down on us (unlike my girlfriend, bitch) early June... Okay, I'll tell you. One of their drugs for eyeball itching didn't achieve statistical significance, but, who gives a fuck about that? It just made the stock cheaper for us. 

OCUL is trading near it's 52 week lows and this is an excellent opportunity to buy in. 

So the drug that OCUL has up for approval is called DEXTENZA. Now, I'm looking at their top line Phase 3 trial results and they look fucking amazing. I'm not a doctor by any stretch of the imagination but I'm pretty good with numbers and 50% of their placebo group experiences ""dry eye"" or whatever the fuck they're trying to treat, compared to only 13% of their actual trial group experiencing symptoms. 

This is pretty good, lots of people are being cured by this medication. Also, they mentioned some shit about retention. I have no idea what the fuck that means but I know in some cases if 100% of your patients can hold the drug in their system for 14 days and 97% for 30 days, that's a fucking solid sign. 

Look, their drug is hot shit, if you don't believe me go look at the charts they included with their press release [here](http://www.ocutx.com/pipeline/dexamethasone-punctum-plug). In ALL cases a substantial number of patients taking the drug exhibited strong results, and, an absence of eye pain compared to their placebo group. 

Their trial results were solid and it's a super solid drug that has a real high chance of approval. Again, I'm not a doctor BUT if there is a doctor here, I'll send you the trial results and maybe you can go over them? The more people that look at this company the stronger the DD...

Also, this is a biopharm company, so, their financials don't really mean much but they're pretty solid. They have 10 quarters of cash runway so they won't really need to raise any money anytime soon. They equity is also pretty nigh. The P/B ratio for this company is less that 2 which is really fucking amazing for a drug company in their trial stages. 

This is an excellent time to buy in and the market has really over reacted from the negative results of one of their other trials for a different drug released earlier this year. Regardless, this sweet valuation is only going to make this fucker pop more when the FDA stamps a nice go-ahead on their drug. 

Yeah, so, I'm buying in. 

Disclamer: I'm really autistic so please do you own DD I'm not even sure if I'm looking at the right numbers.

"Professional Petroleum Landman, Novice Investor here; My thoughts on the Oil Industry",0.88,"I'm a 5 year landman based out of Midland, TX. I'm in no way a guru or pretending to know it all, nor am I in the business of predicting oil price, but I think there's a small fortune to be made from oil and gas companies right now on the market. 

As I type this, crude sits just below $50/barrel. I believe the worst of the bust is behind us and it's a slow, but steady climb back towards $100/barrel. I'm spreading out most of my portfolio between small cap and larger cap companies that have their main acreage in the Permian Basin of Texas. Here's why. It's the most consistent play in America. This is ground zero for oil and gas and will continue to be until they find a better field. America is different than most oil producing countries because our oil is not nationalized. Our private citizens still own their own mineral rights vs. other countries where the government makes all the money from oil sales.

Why is this important?
America will weather the storm of bust oil prices far better than countries that the sale of oil is a significant part of their national budget. With prices already bottoming out (fingers crossed we don't head south now), most companies have plans through hedging to make it back to where we are now plus some this time in 2017. Most companies have hedged their oil less than what the current price is and I believe the price of oil will only go up, leading to better earnings, company evaluations, and eventually stock price.

Being in Midland, I get the benefit of hearing the chatter around town. I can't name any names on stuff I hear, but sentiment in town is optimistic for the first time in a couple years. Lots of mergers and buy outs coming down the pipeline. I don't really think there's a bad play on any company that based out of the Permian at this time.

Not sure if I should plug in my plays that I'm currently in on here or not. But if anyone has any questions or criticisms, I'm all ears. 

EDIT: Taking my dog to the vet so I'm done for today. Stocks I like are $CWEI - $27.10, $PXD - $157.24, and $CXO - $125.74. Added price as of writing so I can be held accountable and mocked if they fall. Good luck, all!",2016-06-21 16:59:44
"Guys, I have a plan for the ultimate Yolo.",1.0,"(shameless plug) I recently made a post on seeking alpha about a covered call ETF. If you don't understand what that is check it out here:

But while that post was more intended for reasonable investors I have come up with an idea that can appeal to those of us who are a little more retarded. 

**The Ultimate Yolo**

1. First I need one of you to help me find a broker that lets you trade options on weird derivatives. Like 3x etns etc. My current broker doesn't let you do this 

2. Get a personal loan from SOFI for 50,000 dollars, add that to my own savings for a total of 100,000 dollars. Invest this 100,000 dollars into the covered call ETF: QYLD.

3. Use Margin to double my position from $100,000 to $200,000. Now I am collecting 18% (9% x2 ) per year in monthly dividends. 

4. **Sell** even more covered call options on the covered call ETF for another 18,000 dollars per year. This is virtually guaranteed money because the covered call ETF doesn't grow . 

5. Collect 36,000 dollars per year and reinvest it into more shares of the ETF. 

6. After 10 years of compounding interest this bad boy would be worth over $7,899,815. And that is assuming I don't reinvest the dividends with margin (which I would). Remember that $7,899,815 is cash. If I used margin on that sum (and I would) It has a purchasing power of 2x or $15,799,630 Giving me over $200,000 per month. 

It isn't only the covered call ETF that lets you do these massive leverage plays. 2x ETNs with yields over 15% like CEFL, MORL, BDCL etc, offer similar opportunities. In fact the yields on some of these are so high that you can get over 40% with margin without the need to sell options.  KCAP (a non leveraged BDC) yields 18% (with a sub 100% payout ratio) and actually has an options chain with my broker.

TSLA earnings 8/4: space moon rocket that won't explode,1.0,"EDIT:  date is looking like 7/29, there may be a glitch on the TD Ameritrade calander. 

Hey all you earnings yoloers:  Don't forget about TSLA on 7/29.  the earnings might not be such a big deal, but an update on stationary batteries will be.  

-During the last conference call, Elon eluded to 'powerpack' preorders.  He described the order  number as ""bananas"".

-The batteries can slash utility bills by a jaw dropping 20-30% for major companies, like walmart.  This is a no brainer for major retailers and power generators, because of the relative ease of calculating ROI.  The batteries are essentially 'plug and play'.

-Making cars is very hard and takes a long time to grow.  For all the enthusiasm, TSLA has an astounding 5 years of car production baked into the stock price.  The gigafactory is ahead of schedule and batteries will even begin shipping Q3.  impatient wallstreet investors will like this.

-During the shareholder meeting, elon announced that the powerwall batteries will be significantly cheaper to install with more kWh for the same price.  this didn't get much attention, but it's a major step forward in linking them to solar and wind.

-There are supposedly surprises about the model X that have yet to be revealed.

- TSLA is on track to be cash flow positive in Q4.

-Model 3 announced in just 9 months now.

-For all the negativity it gets, TSLA is a great stock.  If you pay close attention to why it moves, it's very possible to predict and get sik gainz.

The 15k challenge! Week #3,0.82,"This week was kinda meh for me. I started up classes again, so that takes some of my time away from focusing on trading, although that's probably good in the long run. I fucked up a little and I think I figured out it's from not listening to my gut instincts and trying to see things that aren't really there. I'll explain when I list each trade.

Closed trades:

* 2 AIG Sep. $55 calls at .70 - This was a breakeven trade after commissions. I entered at the wrong time so I was happy to get out without a loss. I also did this in my secondary account which gives me more options, but a higher commission. So I would have made at least a little had it been my main account, not much though.

* 2 PLUG Sep. $4 calls at 1.75 - made about $100 on this one. I was hoping for more, but I decided to dump now to avoid the accelerating theta decay. Still about 40% though, so not bad.

New positions:

* 60,000 shares of SLNX at .0025 - risky otc sub penny stock, I know. But, I've been following this for a while and this area looks to be pretty good support. I'm looking for a quick run up to .004 area maybe .005 and I will dump. It's not uncommon for this stock to have 25-50% moves in a day. If you look at it from april-may, it went fucking crazy and I watched from the sidelines thinking it can't go any higher. I don't think that type of rise will happen again, but I do think I can make a quick $100 or so.

* 3 TGT Sep. $58.5 puts - This one I ignored the option activity in front of me. I guess I convinced myself that the action in the weekly $60 calls were sold to open to gather that high IV premium, although I knew in the back of my head they were buys. I was right about the content of the report though! Missed earnings number, rev number, lower margins especially in canadian division, and lowered forward guidance! And they still went up! When JKS reported an earnings and rev beat, along with increased guidance, they got hammered. Sometimes I just don't get it. 

* 15 LULU weekly $41 calls - This is what I was referring to ignoring my gut. I knew I should have got the $40s instead, but my greed was telling me that the breakout was going to be really strong and it would hit $41. The $40s would have been a gamble too, but I would have at least made a little instead of expiring worthless. That put me down about $250.

* 3 JRJC Sep. $9 puts - This is me seeing PLUG in March all over again. Over 100% increase in just 5 days, and irrational exuberance all over stocktwits. I'll be honest, I don't know much about the company, but it doesn't seem like their ""new financial trading services"" announcement warrants an increase of this caliber. I just picked these up this morning, and I thought it would crash today to be honest, but it didn't. It had a bit of faltering, but I'm sure next week it will be going down. 

Open positions:

* AFOP - still holding my calls, have an open order to sell half at .75. Apparently they are presenting at an event on Tuesday, so I'm hoping that they have some good info to share and give the stock a bump. I'll probably dump these this week either way though to free up some cash.

* GE - still holding the Jan. calls, and I'm looking to add to some Mar. calls as well. I'm thinking this will be big. Hopefully we'll see some of the fruits of divestment in Oct. earnings and then a steady rise throughout the remainder of the year.

* OPK - still holding these calls because they are practically worthless, so I've already written them off in my head. That's about another $300, so I'm not too happy about that. I'm still up on the shares I have and will continue to hold for the promising long term prospects, but I purchased those a few months back and don't count towards the challenge. Hoping for second Rayaldee results before expiration so I can salvage something off them.

* JKS - I'm getting ready to dump these, but it never seems to be able to decide which way to go intra-day. The daily chart is looking nice though, and they have been rising on pretty decent volume (except today) so I'm hoping for a touch of $30 next week. Definitely possible, because the last run from around the levels it started at went to $31. I'll continue to hold the Jan. calls though.

**Current closed profit/loss = ($255) Current open profit/loss = ($75)** 

I think I'm gonna re-evaluate my strategy a bit. A fellow redditor pointed out some things and I think I'll start applying some of them. I'm gonna try and make a lesser amount trades, but of bigger sizing that I have more conviction in. Like GE, once I free up some cash I will be adding to that. I'm gonna try and play less earnings, especially for companies I haven't really followed in the past. I'm going to listen to my gut instincts more and stop looking for what I want to see. Hopefully that will help, I know I can't have good weeks every week, but a lot of my mistakes so far have been stupid and avoidable on my part. 

As always feel free to leave any comments, suggestions, criticism, ideas, etc. I enjoy hearing your feedback and listening to different perspectives because in the end, this is as much a learning process, as a money-making challenge. Thanks for reading and following along everyone!

The 15k challenge! week #2,0.79,"Alright so the second week has come to a close. I'm not super pleased, but I am not disappointed either. I was expecting a bit more this week, but I had mixed results. Let's start with the new positions I added.

* 5 OPK Sep. $10 calls - I got burned on these for now. I guess I misread the option activity leading up to earnings, it looked like someone was buying to open a lot of the August $10's. They had a great report though IMO, so I'm going to hold for now, hoping to recover some of the value on these. The second set of Rayaldee results are set to be out sometime in September too, so hopefully that will be before expiration and help me out a bit.

* 3 JKS Sep. $29 calls - This is an earnings play. I'm thinking they are gonna beat expectations by a good bit. CSIQ ran hard after their beat, and I believe JKS to be a better company when were talking chinese solar. They have some of the highest margins in the industry, plus their utility scale project development is going to be a huge benefit too. I'm hoping to see $30+ next week.

* 1 PLUG Jan. 2015 $6 Put (Sold to open) - This is a longer term play, the premium I'm getting results in about a 23% return if the option expires worthless. I think it's likely that shares will be north of $6 by that time, they have done a great job of ramping up production and signing new customers. 

I haven't closed any of my prior positions yet. I attempted to sell half of my AFOP calls at 105% return earlier this week during a spike, but my order never got filled. So I'll be waiting for a pop this week and then trying to dump them. Same thing with the PLUG Sep. $4s and AIG Sep. $55s. AIG has shown remarkable strength lately, and if it can get through it's 50 SMA next week, than it's golden. 

**Current closed profit/loss = $0 Current open profit/loss = $152**

OPK is what's really bringing me down right now, but I am very hopeful for this upcoming week. I'm thinking JKS, AFOP, & PLUG will do very well.

What I'll be watching next week:

GE for a potential spot to add to my position.

YHOO to maybe grab some calls for just after the Alibaba ipo. Not set on this one yet, but I'll be watching.

GTAT for some puts. I'm long term bullish on this company, but it's starting to look overbought to me, and it's lost a lot of it's momo. 17-18 is always a struggle for this stock, so if it starts to falter, I'm gonna be grabbing some short term puts.

SLTD for a place to add. I have a small position from around .07 and I want to grab some more to hold long term, but I don't want to pull the trigger to quick. I want more evidence of a base in this area. 

BWEN for a good spot to sell a covered call. This is one of my favorite (and longest held) stocks. It's been struggling recently though even after a good quarter report. These options aren't traded that much though, so I really need to time it well for it to be worthwhile.

What's everybody's thoughts so far? Like my calls? Hate them? Have anything else I should watch? Let me know, I'm open to ideas and discussion. Thanks for following so far guys!

[Week 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/2d0hfy/the_15k_challenge_week_1/)",2014-08-15 20:19:38
The 15k challenge! week #1,0.81,"Welcome to the first week of the 15k challenge! For those that didn't see the original post, I have essentially set myself a challenge to make $15,000 from trading throughout the duration of my 1 year lease so I can use that capital to work on a project to develop a shipping container house.

To start off, I opened 3 positions this week:

* 10 AFOP Sep. $15 calls
* 10 GE Jan. 2015 $27 calls
* 2 AIG Sep. $55 calls

My reasonings behind each position:

* AFOP - It was hit hard after it's earnings came out around 2 weeks ago. I've watched this stock for awhile and I've seen this happen before. Shorts manipulate it for awhile and crash the price down to the high 11s to low 12s, and then it rebounds and recovers and climbs back toward 16-17. I missed out last time I saw this occur, so when I saw the second big down day I jumped in near the bottom. 

* GE - Everybody knows GE isn't going anywhere, and they seem to have been hit pretty hard recently. My intuition tells me that there can't be that much more downside unless something material changes. GE has also been divesting itself of a lot of it's non-core businesses which should be very beneficial to the company and the stock price as well. I've also noticed that they tend to perform better in the second half of the year, so hopefully were seeing a bottom here. 

*   AIG - This one was originally an earnings play, and although the report was good and it was up in AH that day, the next day it gave back all of it's gains. I still think holding for another week or 2 will be good, as I am predicting a slow, steady rise upward over the next few weeks. Long term I am very bullish on AIG, and others are too judging by the 12 million dollars worth of call options bought for Jan. 2016 for the $65 strike the other day.

My previous open positions:

* 2 PLUG Sep. $4 calls 

* 5 PLUG Jan. 2015 $10 calls

* 1 JKS Jan. 2015 $30 calls

I don't think I will count these in the profit/loss calculation for the challenge, since they were all opened a while before I even decided to do the challenge. Unless you guys think I should count whatever is closed in the timeframe? I'm open to ideas here.

**Current closed profit/loss = $0
Current open profit/loss = $251**

I'm open to any and all discussion here, got any comments, suggestions, tips? Lay em out for me. Think I'm an idiot and will take the other side of a trade I put on? Let me know! I'd love to hear your reasoning, and we can discuss and see each others points of view. I really look forward to sharing the challenge with you guys and hopefully learn a lot and make a lot of money along the way! I will be making a new weekly post at the end of each week (the day will depend on my work schedule) to recap what trades I put on or closed out, and I will update the open and closed profit/loss section. I will also try to respond to any and all (serious) comments. Thanks for reading guys!",2014-08-08 20:29:08

Balance sheet is ugly and in debt, but the upswing in volatility and price should make it ripe for swing trading the next few weeks/months.

$HYSR bet has been made by myself for a LT play.,0.59,"I've bet watching Hypersolar secondary to Plug and Ballard Power's recent run-ups. I am taking a substantially long position in Hypersolar's technology development. I've seen it hold steady around 8 cents per share before the markets started to drop out a bit, so I took the buying opportunity around .049.

I'm holding 21k shares of this monster on the bet that they do reach the critical break point of cost to produce hydrogen gas from water at less cost than obtaining it from natural gas refining sources.

If they can get just a little more efficiency out of their current, patented technology, they will be well on their way to setting up a very viable business if the fuel cell markets are really going to be growing.

I personally am hoping for a 1 year gain to .25 cents, and with favorable outcomes to $1/share. If it does hit either of those marks, depending on the circumstances I may sell my position. I see some upside to 10 cents/share in the short term surrounding the earnings season and announcements expected to be made soon.

I'm betting that if fuel cells are the future, this stock is going to be the proverbial wet nurse to these babies for supplying hydrogen for fuel cell stacks. 

Good luck to all, and remember do your due diligence before placing your bets! ",2014-04-18 15:40:10

I was in long before this crazy spike - but to see a 100% +/- swing in one day is out of this world. 

I personally have confidence in this company. Lots of positive news, supposed profitable quarter. But a 40% dip in one day should cause everyone to pause and evaluate. 

Selling after such a large dip is not in my blood. So my question is what can we reasonably expect in the next month, year and 5 years?

I'm not saying the tech isn't real and I know better than to bet against a stock with this sort of momentum but with FCEL and PLUG reporting this week, I have to believe they will disappoint in terms of the expectations that are now priced into the stock.  That is all.

What's up with PLUG?,0.91,"So I know there was the whole walmart deal last week and that there is a lot of hype surrounding fuel cells currently, but how is it up 33% again today? Are we going to see a reversal soon or do you think it will keep climbing? At a certain point won't the hype exceed technical ratings? (Yes I am bitter and sad because I didn't buy PLUG or FCEL)",2014-03-10 17:14:32
A little background on what is going on with fuel cells and maybe a reason to jump in,0.85,"So this is my understanding. Fuel Cell technology was toted on the same lines as solar in 2000 and PLUG and BLDP were partnered with GE during that time to make it happen. The companies were worth 150+. However Hydrogen tech was not there then and the floor fell apart. However PLUG did a reverse split to stay listed on the NASDAQ when it was a penny stock and one of the reasons you see the 1500+ pps if you look at their history. 

Now this is where it gets interesting. PLUG is not going after the same market that it did in 2000. Now it is trying to tackle materials handling equipment on the manufacturing side. What people don't understand is that PLUG spent years finding this niche and making sure they executed. Hydrogen fuel actually works really well here for two reasons. It allows companies to go green and more importantly saves companies money. It does this because Hydrogen fuel batteries recharge in seconds which allows companies to go employee shift to employee shift seamlessly without a delay.

PLUG has positioned themselves as the first to market with this for fork lifts and with Wal-mart has proven themselves as a reliable partner. With the reputation of Wal-mart they can penetrate further into this market which they have barely scraped the surface of.

Sorry for little sources but I wanted to just give a quick synopsis on why I am long and why there is so much buzz. Even if PLUG stays just in this niche and captures a majority of the market the company is way undervalued. On CNBC Andy Marsh the CEO also stated that they are providing infrastructure and services for fuel cell tech that provide additional revenue streams.

Also car companies are getting into fuel cell tech now (i.e. http://www.toyota.com/fuelcell/) and even though PLUG does not participate in this area directly analysts think they might be well positioned to take advantage if it does become efficient and in demand. I think this part is more of the speculation and wishful thinking.

However just with materials handling (i.e. Hydrogen fuel cell forklifts) market I really like this company for investors who like a little risk and want to hold long on a growth stock. ",2014-03-09 14:52:49
So PLUG has been killing it this week.,0.84,"I bought a few weeks ago cause whatever it's just money, but now I'm not really sure what to do, is this a legit long term company or should I just get out soon. It's posted three 20%+ jumps this week and I know they inked a deal with Walmart and were possibly doing one with Toyota, so that could be why it's going up, but is there a ceiling to this? If it seems like a legit long term company, I guess I'll stick around, but I kinda got burned by CERS a couple weeks ago assuming it'd continue to rise slowly before it tanked. 

This however has me intrigued. I mean if I lose, whatever, but it is nice to see one of my stocks go up 90% since I purchased. ",2014-03-07 19:14:33

"I need to make $7k into $10k by Dec. 15, 2014. Can be aggressive. Please help!

I have $7k that I need to turn into $10k by mid December.
In this particular non-retirement account, I have about $2.1k in ARIA, $1k in CIMT, $1.1k in FULL, and $1.1 in IAG.
That leaves me with around $1.6k in liquid money.

Please note: Trading commissions are not a concern for the next 50 days (they're free).

I don't mind selling what I have to free up some capital (although, I'd take a net loss of around $90 to do so). I was hoping ARIA would jump soon, so I'm a bit hesitant to let that go.

I was thinking of going full stupid and just setting stop limits to eke out minor gains on the big marijuana movers and then repeat as much as I could until I run out of commission free trades....but that doesn't sound too bright.

I am invested in SLTD, PLUG, PHOT, and a couple other of the ""hot"" stocks with another brokerage. I wouldn't mind doubling down on those (relatively small) positions if that's the right play here.

Thoughts?

PS. I don't know to trade options so that's probably out of the question right now.
PSS. I am not adverse to alternative currency investments. ",2014-01-31 00:54:55
