$NIO Many people think Nio will only be $400-$500 billion dollar company in the future. I believe longterm they will be a +trillion dollar company. Considering the size of the EV market and the exponential growth. I feel Nio is well positioned to be leader of the EV revolution. You can laugh at me now. But with 1.6 trillion dollar valuation Nio can be $1000 a share or more in the longterm future. I feel they have what it takes.,2021-01-16T17:38:32Z,1442,{'basic': 'Bullish'}

"$NIO 
Retracement Target: $37.80. Over-extension by $1.50 or so 

Looked like $60 was the floor, but continued downwards probably due to market sell-off.

All within parameters of the smaller Wave formation. 3-3-5 correction had an extended Wave 5 and can be any length. 

Wave 3 (Orange) was shorter than Wave 1 (Orange), so following trendlines, we can expect  major Wave 3 to hyper-extend and compete wave structure.

Sharp pullback was expected, as Wave 2 was slow.

Wave 3 capped at $66.98, which is roughly $3 below the top of the Orange Wave 3. It&#39;s still not high enough to be classed as being the top of the Orange Wave 3, so the long term outlook is bullish, but still looking for some sideways consolidation to come.

Very close to intersecting the Orange Wave 4 trendline, and anticipating this to rise in this direction. Should this happen, I&#39;ll be re-adjusting the angle of Wave 3.

Worst case scenario, this drops by another few $.

Will adjust if necessary, but still within trend.",2021-01-16T17:36:23Z,12,{'basic': 'Bullish'}
