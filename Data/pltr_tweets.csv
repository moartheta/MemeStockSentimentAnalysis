"$GME next week should be interesting to see where we go. Logically, we should expect a decent pullback of 20-30% because we have gotten overextended from technicals here. However, usually pullbacks from getting overextended are typically instigated by shorts entering moreso than profit taking. The short signals are there, but in the instance of gme where SI is already astronomical are there enough borrow shares available to pull us down significantly, and is it worth the risk? We shall see, but I have no reasonable prediction of what happens this week. I know I&#39;m not selling my shares but will sell puts if we do drop to mid 20s. Things to watch for are new filings from RC or new board members. Also we can not forget there will be a board approval vote in June where shares will be recalled for voting purposes.

"@biocmii thanks.. I now understand why my broker (Saxo bank) is charging 110% for the margin for CFD of a $GME long position.

So with Saxo bank it is actually more expensive to long a share through a derivative share (CFD) than owning the underlying equity share, but it makes sense if shorts could long the same underlying share to get them out of a position instead of buying the underlying equity share - the borrow cost on the long shares might actually go up at other broker&#39;s more than 100% of the cost of an actual share.

I see the share margin requirements are rising at Fidelity, Schwab and other brokers..

people expect that the margin to borrow a share for long position won&#39;t exceed  the actual cost of a share but this assumption is clearly wrong.

Remember that buying through derivatives (on margin) is a risky business. 

Luckily, I&#39;m long all my shares through underlying equity shares and not via any margin instrument.

James says &quot;It doesn&#39;t take a lot of reading between the lines to understand just how different these two companies are. Both are being affected by major trends in the consumer arena. However, Amazon is benefiting from those trends, while GameStop is a victim of changes within the video gaming market. That makes Amazon the no-brainer buy.&quot;

He also says &quot;Amazon might look expensive right now, but it&#39;s smarter to pay a premium for the winner instead of a steep discount for the loser. I told investors to give up on GameStop last June, and I&#39;m sticking by that call regardless of how badly activist investors want to save this sinking ship.&quot;

Yikes, imagine how those poor investors feel about missing this huge winner after listening to Leo. If an investor placed $1000 into AMZN after reading his propaganda, their investment would have lost value and be worth $983.23 as of last Thursday. Compare that to an investor who smelled bullshit and actually put $1000 into GME. That smarter investors&#39; position would now be worth $3916.84!",2021-01-04T02:44:03Z,738,{'basic': 'Bullish'}

"$GME All the analysts and @Uberkikz11 are estimating Q4 net sales revenues between $2.2 to $2.7 billion, so not sure where shorts are coming off saying &quot;no one shops at gamestop&quot;. Like even the most bearish estimate is $2.2 billion.

Whats more interesting is that the last time we had hit those revenue numbers, there were still large reductions for Asset and Goodwill Impairment which is now complete. GME management has also cut SG&amp;A which goes directly to the bottom line. SG&amp;A has never been this low, and even if you estimate $400 for SG&amp;A, we still have no way of accounting for the MSFT deal kickbacks to add to revenue, and we are on our way to one of the most profitable quarters in recent history.

Whats even better is that delayed console shipments will have customers coming back for months into Q1 2021 for another profitable quarter especially once used game sales revives again.",2020-12-30T15:09:03Z,738,{'basic': 'Bullish'}

"$GME 

Folks there were some questions raised about a buyout scenario.

Based on some folks&#39; experience  with FIT and WORK it does look like the call options might potentially expire worthless (anyone have any first hand info about FIT?).

I am posting this to get your thoughts on how likely a buyout is even there in the first place.

My current thoughts are (based on reading stuff here and there, could be wrong of course).

 - If RC wanted to do a buyout, why did he buy shares in the first place?

 - Because of the high short interest, the number of shares held by shareholders is &gt; 100%. So any market value computations become weird during a buyout. Plus there is a chance of a squeeze which makes things even more weird.

 - The current lawyers of RC seem to also have a track record of changing the management (replace BOD etc).

I think an attempt to replace BOD/CEO seems a much more likely scenario than a buyout.

"$GME  
 
Someone asked what happens to the $35 strike price call options if there is a $30 buyout offer. Here is my guess, hope someone more knowledgeable can comment. 
 
Consider fitbit/Google acquisition at the price of $7.35.  
  
Look at fitbit short interest official data for month of Nov 2019, after the merger with Google was approved.  
  
marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/...  
  
There is no data for Nov/Dec which implies short interest might be  zero (likely due to recalls).  
  
Note that there was a ~2.5x spike in price of fitbit prior to the vote which happened on Nov 1st and briefly spiked to $8.4 and has stayed relatively flat below $7.35 since then. The short interest prior to the vote was ~12% and there was likely a lot of fomo (not sure of the exact public news timelines).  
  
Conclusion: 
Since the shareholder vote could reject the buyout I suspect before that it is business as usual and that includes price changes due to share recalls and the buyout price does not really matter.",2020-12-25T20:53:51Z,2156,{'basic': 'Bullish'}
"$GME I was thinking a lot.

It is not about Gamestop anymore. 

Here we have a comodity and it is highly rare one, you can not find it anywhere, it is limited. Currently around 69million only. And we have borrowers, who borrowed ~68million maybe more and they are paying 20% interest, sometimes more.

They will need to buy, to give it back to original owners.

The question is what price?

40? - dont think so. 

80? - maybe some

100? - a little bit more.

I will sell 300. Just coz I want to get 300.

If GameStop has something good to talk about tomorrow, I‚Äôm guessing we hear all about it loud and clear.  All Sherman‚Äôs incentives ‚Äì financial, ego ‚Äì point to him trying to knock it out of the park with Q4 guidance.

"@Ack2020 @city_lights 6/7 $GME And this kid demands another strategic review and a public response on the obvious direction that Sherman needs to take the company.  Sherman is not dumb. He knows who Cohen‚Äôs attorney is and he knows what Cohen is implying in that letter and the money Cohen has.  Sherman now knows that the time he has to show shareholders he can turn this thing around has now shrunk.  It‚Äôs go time. New consoles are out, Q4 numbers are likely to be through the roof and you have to address shareholders for the Q3 earnings call ‚Äì one that everyone knows is likely to be a dud since it was pre-console cycle.  So it‚Äôs a gimmie on numbers anyway.  What self-respecting Master of the Universe hired gun Boomer CEO would just wilt under this pressure and fail to give every possible piece of good news to try to show shareholders his worth?

And he knows that he‚Äôs going to be able to show shareholders that he can turn this thing around. But then this Chewy billionaire startup bro who is probably the same age as his children comes in and starts trying to tell *him* how to run a major public corporation.  The nerve of this kid.  Then, to make things worse, as Sherman prepares for the console release season and the Q3 earnings call, Cohen writes a scathing public letter attached to his 13D that calls out GameStop for being run by idiots and calls out Sherman specifically for being an out-of-touch boomer who doesn‚Äôt know the value of what he even has or what to do with it.",2020-12-08T07:25:03Z,565,{'basic': 'Bullish'}

"@Ack2020 @city_lights 3/7 $GME And if the letter he sent last month reflects reality and is not posturing, Cohen is rebuffed a bit.  Maybe Boomer Sherman doesn‚Äôt like the cut of his jib and patronizes him.  Maybe Cohen didn‚Äôt like Sherman‚Äôs focus on short term profit at the expense of building long-term customer loyalty (the one of two trucks his Dad talks about, which Cohen cites frequently in his interviews).  Who knows.  But whatever it was, being rebuffed seems to piss Cohen off--judging by the tone of that letter. Oh, and he‚Äôs made it known that he has hired basically the top activist investor/takeover law firm and attorney in the country.  So he puts Sherman in the hot seat: outline your plan to make GameStop what I know it can be as soon as possible.  He knows Q3 earnings is in three weeks when he sends that letter.

"@Ack2020 @city_lights 2/7 $GME And then almost exactly a year ago, Cohen‚Äôs Dad dies.

Do not underestimate what that can do to someone and what lessons one might take from that or how that person feels now barely a year away from that happening.  Cohen clearly reveres his Dad for his hard working ethic and how he taught him tenacity when you know you‚Äôre right.  So Cohen finds $GME and he sees that this brilliantly set-up company has been run into the ground by prior management.  He thinks he knows the way out: the ‚ÄúChewy-fication‚Äù of GameStop ‚Äì efficient, customer-focused ecommerce sector domination.

But first take Cohen. Boy genius who builds Chewy with his smarts and an ethos dedicated to care for the customer. Beats Amazon in this niche area because he outworked and outsmarted everyone. Worked super close with his Dad, who sounds like an amazing businessman with an old school ethic about treating customers/employees well. After building this juggernaut he sold it for 3Bil.

"$GME For those entered today, underwater but still holding, there are a few things not obvious, but should help:
1) Management bought back about 34% shares in 2019, therefore when comparing current price against pre 2019 prices, please discount current price by about a third - this is why you see lots of &quot;market cap&quot; plots, because those naturally compensate total share differences;
2) The big bulls have been extremely &quot;sneaky&quot; over the past year at least, accumulating without triggering a real squeeze. It&#39;s astonishing that the short interest remains this high this long. There is an obvious increase of spread between bid and ask since about 1 month ago, indicating very thin float, and/or market maker trying to slow down action. Price volatility has been amplified - this could be caused by thin trading float; if true, this also makes price manipulation easier, therefore providing positive feedback to amplify price movement even more.
3) This is the best place for GME DD. Settle down.",2020-11-30T22:19:16Z,3697,

Additionally, &quot;sell the news&quot; event hasn&#39;t happened because we&#39;re still in the rumor phase. The rumor is that Gamestop is about to transform into a lean, mean machine through e-commerce growth, physical storefront optimization + reimagination, and launching new verticals.

I did -

Good afternoon,

I&#39;ll save the fluff. GME is likely well aware of the volatility created by the recent articles and amended filing from Mr. Cohen on 11/16.

Does GME have an inclination or a plan to offer a response. Shareholders support Mr. Cohen&#39;s vision, and GME presents as though recent changes are in line with this vision. The discrepancy requires rectification not only for sentiment, but for sound financial decision making for individuals who believe in this company, but have long been disillusioned as a result of the inherent instability from shorted shares/interests.

Some bearish articles were talking about GME being &quot;overbought&quot;  which likely referred to the Relative Strength Indicator (RSI). The RSI on the 30min chart has hugged the &quot;oversold&quot; 30-level and pierced or touched it 3 times. With each dip its been higher lows than the last. Momentum indicator is similar and has made higher lows on each dip. The price as actually made lower lows so technical traders call that divergence and can signal a reversal. In combination with a strong support level holding up and perhaps a hammer candle or two, you got strong (not absolute) evidence of a reversal. Using the RSI indicator by itself is useless.

Like any &quot;trade&quot; there is always varying risk  and you have to manage them. Trading is different mentality than investing and you need to understand probabilities, risk-to-reward, win rates, etc.",2020-10-29T17:10:19Z,738,{'basic': 'Bullish'}

"$GME I&#39;ll just repost my crummy thoughts here for anyone who cares since we&#39;re getting a lot of questions about volume:

Given current state of market, I think the smart play is to sit out and wait post elections for most players. The only real volume is HFT algos and indexes with maybe a small real buyers here and there along with retail shorts playing in the sandbox; expect low to no real volume. What do I think will happen? We will oscillate sideways at $11 to $12 bucks until something that matters comes, like console release sales and potentially earnings including that data from managements end. 

After that though when market is less uncertain about COVID-19 and election results along with everything else, people will want to look at the best prospective targets and buy in. As the data comes out for short interest only shows increased short interest, they&#39;ll either watch list it or buy in--hopefully as strong, iron hands.",2020-10-29T16:45:53Z,7427,

"$GME Today&#39;s volume of 2.7M was the lowest in 3months. The last time the volume was this low was on 7/24 when GME closed at 4.03. 

If we consider notional traded- you have to go back years to find a day where less $$ traded. 

In conclusion- Along with the string of low volume days, it seems the bets have been placed, and now they will wait to see if GME can execute. This will take time to materialize as:

Ultimately every thesis (Bull/Bear) hinges on the same thing- 

Can GME return sales back to stable/grow? And if they can, how much EBITDA and FCF can you generate off those sales.

Every other scenario ultimately leads back to the above question. RC wants a stake, great, can he help GME with the above? Does console drop, help with the above? Etc.",2020-10-05T20:25:52Z,498,
