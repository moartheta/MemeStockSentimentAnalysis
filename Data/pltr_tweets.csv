That means the floor has been cemented there removing risk of this going below that number. That makes swing trading with even higher share counts in the mid 20‚Äôs fantastic as this can‚Äôt go down much at all from there.

‚ÄúPalantir, which was cofounded by Silicon Valley mogul and vocal Trump-supporter Peter Thiel, has been criticized in the past for its contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

A document created by Palantir about Tiberius, seen by the Journal, said it would &quot;integrate a wide range of demographic, employment, and public health data sets to identify the location of priority populations.&quot;

Combined with infection data, the idea is the tool will enable local officials to &quot;proactively identify distribution bottlenecks, inventory constraints, and gaps in administration across key populations,&quot; the document said.

Another of Palantir&#39;s services, called HHS Protect, is also currently being used by the HHS Department to track COVID-19 hospitalizations. The department&#39;s spokeswoman said Tiberius is built on the same software as HHS Protect.",2020-10-23,5049,Bullish
