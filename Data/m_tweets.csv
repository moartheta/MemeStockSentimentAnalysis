RBNW specialize in designer shoes. As part of their move to capture a new audience base, they designed a new home ware collection including fluffy comfy slippers for all the stay at home work we will be doing due to the pandemic.

Heeding a shift in consumer habits away from brick-and-mortar stores and the recent impact of COVID-19, Macy&#39;s has closed its Dover Mall store to shoppers and will instead use the building as a fulfillment center during the holiday shopping season, Delaware News Journal&#39;s Brandon Holveck reports. The new model is being implemented as a test at two of the 546 Macy&#39;s nationwide, namely the Dover store and a store in Littleton, Colorado, the author says. In a statement, the company said the pilot is in response to an uptick in online orders shipped directly to customers or their nearest store",2020-10-14T19:03:52Z,159,
