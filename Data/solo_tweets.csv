"$SOLO All the reasons to hate other small EV companies 
NKLA - Trevor Milton was a snake oil salesman with no experience building cars. 
 
AYRO - I just don&#39;t see there being a future in some fintech types trying to sell electric golf carts.   
 
FUV - can&#39;t drive it in sun or rain because it leaves drivers exposed to the elements all day. So, again, what&#39;s the point. 
 
LI, XPEV or any of the Chinese companies. There&#39;s the risk of finding out their numbers were as creative as Luckin. No transparency. 
 
FSR - he failed and went bankrupt before and the vegan SUV feels like a gimmic.  If there was a demand, BMW could make its electric X5 (its going full electric soon) vegan. Wait... I think it already is so long as you don&#39;t opt for leather seats. 
 
SOLO - cars built by someone who built cars 40 years before the &quot;EV sector&quot; became hot.  Better transparency and accountability than a Chinese company. Filling niches quite well.",2020-11-25T13:15:07Z,2443,

"$SOLO our time will come, you don‚Äôt have to believe me or trust my word. DO YOUR OWN DD, AND TRADE AT YOUR OWN RISK! 

But in my most honest opinion, I will be accumulating shares EVERY DAY around this range. I don‚Äôt care how long it takes, but this will FLY past $10+ in the next 12 months and I will be sitting here waiting for it. 

Again, the bare minimum I recommend in having is at least 10k shares if you‚Äôre looking to give this company a year to grow.  WHY you might ask? Because as I stated previously this should FLY past $10+ and when it does this will be an EASY 6 FIGURE BONUS RETURN on top of my yearly salary. 10 years from now, MILLION dollar return.

Fleet contracts, Partnerships, Pre Order Numbers, Announcement on Tofino and ERoadster. ALL THESE CATALYST are super strong for the next 12-18 months and I‚Äôm not missing NOT one of them. Money is safe and sound with no risk of bankruptcy only fluctuations between the stock price every day.
