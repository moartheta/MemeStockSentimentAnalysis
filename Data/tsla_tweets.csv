Chief Financial Officer Amy Ard projected 2020 revenues to hover near $200 million.
In addition, Ard said during a call announcing the deal the company expects a compound annual growth rate of 68 percent, from 2020 to 2025. 
‚ÄúSignificant, but, certainly very achievable,‚Äù she said.
2025 revenues could top $2.5 billion, assuming 114 percent growth in the powered and energy lines and almost 40 percent growth in the transit lines, according to growth projections filed with the SEC.",2021-01-16T17:46:35Z,2865,{'basic': 'Bullish'}

Bloomberg Research estimated  the Federal  Reserve Bank of New York&#39;s ownership percentage for several of the most popular ETF&#39;s in the corporate bond sector.  

In this  hypothetical 13-f report, you can see that the New York Fed is listed as the 2nd largest holder of the Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond ETF, and top 5 for many other ETF&#39;s in the sector as well.  

Still, when it comes to government managed equities markets, nobody comes close to the Bank of Japan, which has somehow managed to establish an 80% ownership interest in the entire ETF market domiciled in that country!

"$TSLA Volkswagen&#39;s Electric ID.4 Models Launch in China, Giving Tesla New Competition in the World&#39;s Biggest Auto Market.  
  
On Tuesday, Volkswagen launched the ID.4 CROZZ and ID.X models for the China market. The fully-electric ID.4 CROZZ is being manufactured by Volkswagen&#39;s joint venture with China&#39;s FAW Group, while the ID.4 X is being built by SAIC Volkswagen, a separate joint venture with Chinese automaker SAIC Motor that was founded in 1984.  
The launch of the two new electric models marks the beginning of VW&#39;s planned push into China. The automaker is planning to launch eight ID. family electric models by 2023 and up to 15 EVs by 2025.   
In September, Volkswagen announced plans to invest roughly 15 billion euros ($17.44 billion) in electric vehicles with its local joint ventures in China.  
Volkswagen is also bringing its ID.4 crossover to the U.S. The U.S. version will be produced in Chattanooga, Tennessee at Volkswagen&#39;s assembly plant.

A Chinese electric car maker has surpassed Tesla as the most popular stock among amateur traders around the world as punters pile into shares of technology companies and start-ups, according to Etoro, the online investment platform. 
The number of Etoro customers buying shares in Shanghai-based Nio jumped by 50 per cent month-on-month in October, the trading firm said yesterday. It now ranks above Tesla, the American electric car maker, in popularity on Etoro‚Äôs platform and is ahead of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and the video-conferencing company Zoom.

"$TSLA  Musk has a reputation for taking to Twitter to reveal information about vehicle updates, features, and the future. However, lately, we haven&#39;t heard a whole lot from him, at least when it comes to information that is considered a big deal, and is coming soon.  
Musk has to be careful about what he shares. As far as we understand, he still has an agreement with the SEC that he won&#39;t share certain information on Twitter and/or that it must be approved first. As you may know, ex-Nikola CEO Trevor Milton has been accused of making false comments about the company&#39;s upcoming vehicles, and that may also be something the Musk is trying to be more careful about. 
While some say Musk makes false comments, others just say he&#39;s optimistic and Tesla is often unable to live up to his crazy timelines. However, some optimistic plans are very far off.
