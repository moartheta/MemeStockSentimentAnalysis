Weichai Power (2338.Hong Kong), Ballard’s largest shareholder, is raising $2 billion in cash for hydrogen projects. “It is clear to us that fuel cells represent a core component of [Weichai’s] growth strategy over coming decades,” wrote Glen. “Investors do not fully appreciate Weichai Power’s position, market share, OEM relationships and overall scale in the largest market for commercial trucks [and] buses globally.” OEM is short for original equipment manufacture and, in this case, refers to companies making heavy-duty trucks and buses in China.

Stock Charts - &quot;RUNAWAY GAPS&quot;  
This gap type occurs in the middle of a trend, showing the urgency of the market to join the fast-moving trend. Runaway gaps propel the trend. Hence, they offer fantastic opportunities to join the trend as it continues. 
First, if a runaway gap is valid, the trend will continue unambiguously. Hence, if the trade works out, the market should not fill the gap any time soon. This observation gives us a simple yet reliable method to set a stop-loss order – at the opposite end of the gap. 
Next, a runaway gap tends to form in the middle of a trend. This means that you can use the trending movement before the gap to project price targets. For this reason, a runaway gap is also known as a measuring gap. 
Now, let’s encapsulate these concepts into practical guidelines for trading runaway gaps.

BATTERY RECYCLING INDUSTRY

ALL UNDER ONE ROOF- STARTED BY TSLA EX EMPLOYEES 
THIS IS NOT A PUMP AND DUMP, RATHER AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY THAT COMES ALONG ONCE IN A BLUE MOON

Company filed S1 papers this past week to trade on NDAQ

Also recently broke ground on construction site in NV for factory next to TSLA gigafactory.

Although speculative in nature, due your own DD and you will see the excitement and opportunity in the early stages of what will become a major player in the EV, battery recycling and lithium world.

You don’t have to take my word for it
Don’t have to believe me people, read for yourselves.

Happy holidays!",2020-12-26T00:19:32Z,331,

I believe what you are seeing is the extra cash on hand from PLUG to ramp up more quickly than previous stated. We will see probably (2) giga factories (north america and europe) europe is a huge market and PLUG needs to really focus on that. You will also see a huge ramp up with these green hydrogen plants, you may even start to see a couple of these in Europe be announced. You really can pick any announcement at this time. there are so many to choose, pedestal, giga, green hydrogen, acquisition, partner, new pilots (aka microsoft data center, GSEs, Hydrogen pipeline) anyways best of luck to all.

"@firehorse Why do you insult my portfolio without having any knowledge about what I own? Why does that matter in the first place? I&#39;m simply stating an argument that holding shares on a possible run up to earnings and possible pop after earnings is POSSIBLE. You&#39;ve given up on this company obviously. I gave up on $PLUG power when I started the markets years ago. I owned 1000 shares around $2.00 each. But I figured they were a horrible company, and I still feel that way despite it being $15 a share now... But you see what I&#39;m trying to say here? I don&#39;t know wtf will happen, neither do you. I would rather hold a position in shares and swing trade for profit/sell the profitable shares and hold the other shares for free. This is not weekly contracts expiring today smh. Bloat about your portfolio some more, you&#39;ll be missing opportunities left and right because you are a dying breed.

During the previous price cycle, PLUG hit a 52-week high of $14.35 and fell to the high $10’s before moving back up. The drop from the most recent high of $19.02 a couple of weeks ago to an intraday low of $14.36 earlier this week was a similar percentage drop as before. Now, the stock seems to recovering gradually as earnings time approaches. Hopefully, this next price cycle after earnings is released and then a major pedestal customer is named in December, PLUG will breach $20 and get to an intraday high somewhere in the low $20’s sometime after as the overall longer-term price trend continues upward.

Shell targets German offshore wind and green hydrogen
30 September 2020 by Craig Richard

The oil and gas major aims to restructure its German business as it aims to become a net-zero emissions energy company before 2050
Oil and gas major Shell plans to restructure its German business to invest in offshore wind and green hydrogen as it tests the waters in becoming a net-zero emissions energy company before 2050.

It aims to participate in offshore wind in Germany and possibly use output to produce green hydrogen, the company announced.

The oil and gas giant also outlined ambitions to become a leading supplier of green hydrogen for industrial and transport customers.

It aims to increase the electrolysis capacity at its Rhineland refinery tenfold and to also investigate further hydrogen projects...

During the previous price cycle, PLUG hit a 52-week high of $14.35 and fell to the high $10’s before moving back up. The drop from the most recent high of $19.02 a couple of weeks ago to an intraday low of $14.36 earlier this week was a similar percentage drop as before. Now, the stock seems to recovering gradually as earnings time approaches. Hopefully, this next price cycle after earnings is released and then a major pedestal customer is named in December, PLUG will breach $20 and get to an intraday high somewhere in the low $20’s sometime after as the overall longer-term price trend continues upward.

Shell targets German offshore wind and green hydrogen
30 September 2020 by Craig Richard

The oil and gas major aims to restructure its German business as it aims to become a net-zero emissions energy company before 2050
Oil and gas major Shell plans to restructure its German business to invest in offshore wind and green hydrogen as it tests the waters in becoming a net-zero emissions energy company before 2050.

It aims to participate in offshore wind in Germany and possibly use output to produce green hydrogen, the company announced.

The oil and gas giant also outlined ambitions to become a leading supplier of green hydrogen for industrial and transport customers.

It aims to increase the electrolysis capacity at its Rhineland refinery tenfold and to also investigate further hydrogen projects...
