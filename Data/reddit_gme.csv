How Friday's GME gamma squeeze may trigger a short squeeze on Monday and Tuesday,0.97,"I don't know if anyone else noticed, but Friday was kind of a big one for GME. It **ripped face** from $43 up to $75 in the morning session. That was fucking wild, even for this autist's dream of a stock. 

Other's have already commented on why this has happened, but I'll summarize for this dunces in the back. In short, the market makers wrote a LOT of OTM calls last week, and then had to buy shares to cover when those calls went ITM around noon. This is what caused the absurd spike from $50 to $75 in just an hour and a half. That's the **gamma squeeze** that everyone has been talking about, where MM's couldn't cover fast enough.

The rest is history, GME closed at $65, and every single call that expired yesterday was ITM. That's fucking retarded. 

What this means, though, is that the MM's/brokers are going to have to deliver a ridiculous amount of shares when these expired options settle. Typically, settlement is on a Tuesday. I've read estimates that 10-15M shares worth of calls expires ITM on Friday. Again, this is fucking retarded. 

Please note that **none** of the above movement relates directly to the short squeeze... but it will. Because there are now 10-15M shares tied up in the clearing houses, there are now ever **fewer** shares to be borrowed. There are estimated that the true short interest on this stock was around 300%. Now, with about 20% of the total float **committed to the fucking clearing house** as they sort out Friday's shitshow, I expect it’s closer to 500%. 

Demand for GME will continue to pump on Monday. It's a cultural event now, where every lay person can be a modern-day Robin Hood. The shorts are going to have their positions closed whether they like it or not if this continues (which it will). Since there are far far far fewer shares floating over the next 2 trading days, though, a squeeze on Monday or Tuesday could utterly destroy Melvin and the other shorts. 

If RC even opens his twitter app this weekend, it's over.

"Part of what happened with GME yesterday, some things to consider moving forward.",0.98,"Long time first time yada yada yada... tldr at bottom

So did you see what all those stupid articles on whatever ad-infested websites were saying yesterday?? “GameStop soars another 50% from EPIC short squeeze, up 69% (nice) at time of halt.” You see this and think omg it’s actually happening. Wrong. Anyone with half a brain that doesn’t use the word retard while writing an article can work for those asinine media companies. So while a couple of us are partly qualified for those jobs and are able to fit the rectangle block in the rectangle hole, our pristine vernacular of the English language may have us shown the door (maybe the same one our friend at the helm of Citron is on his way through). Now even a former Boglehead like me should be able to figure out that the short squeeze has not been mcsquozen. Quick quote before we get into things...

I think it was Denzel Washington who once said “If you don’t read the newspaper, you’re uninformed. But if you do read the newspaper, you’re misinformed.” Definitely something to think about in this day and age. 

Anyway moving on. As probably many people at this point have already said, what happened on Friday was a gamma squeeze. This comes from MM’s having to hedge from all of us degenerates buying options. They however work a little differently than us when it comes to limiting their exposure. Us morons have to have 100 shares of a stock to be able to sell a covered call against it. If we had less than 100 shares, we may as well be as naked as the GameStop shorts. There’s this little guy called delta (frankly if you don’t know the Greeks it may be wise to take a quick break from options and learn those little buggers) that MM’s use as their indicator of how many shares they need to limit their exposure. Delta is a number between 0 and 1. Say you buy an option and the delta is .41, MM’s have to buy 41 shares to limit their downward exposure. But as the share price moves closer to the strike price, delta will increase and thus the MM’s will have to buy a few more shares (and vice versa with price moving down). So with the sheer amount of those otm options purchased yesterday (looking at you 55-60 calls), MM’s had to hedge accordingly, but as more people bought those calls as the price became closer and closer to the strike, it created a fun feedback loop where the MM’s were then forced purchase those additional shares as delta increased. So then after the halts, call buyers near and far took their profits which caused the MM’s to unwind their exposure bringing the stock price back down. If you bought $3,000 worth of 60c 0DTE and sold at the right time, you would’ve made a cool million+ (I know right what the fuck?!?!). So could this happen again next Friday? If a lot people expect a gamma squeeze like this to happen and buy a shitload of way otm calls, then it could be a self-fulfilling prophecy and there will be many new millionaires made next Friday. I personally have some PLTR calls I’ll be selling next week after demo day to try and fuck around with some 0DTE’s and most likely get burned lol. But don’t you ever listen to someone who says they know exactly where a stock price is going in the future and always do your own DD. 

Anyone else find it very odd that the highest strike price call option was only $60, AND THAT IT FINISHED ITM???? Either way calls with new strikes have been written (anyone see those 1/29 115’s lmao). 

So moving forward into next week, don’t be scared or discouraged if we have some relatively flatter days, we’ve been 💎 🖐 this far. Personally I would sort of like to see GME consolidate a little bit in the beginning part of the week (this is healthy for a stock - increasing exponential growth of +50% every day, while it looks just dandy on your account, cannot be kept up at any longer term rate). Also, as of today GME has 8 more days for their fourth quarter earnings. You know what this means? Buy PowerUp rewards, buy a console for your wife’s bf (preferably a bundle), buy used games (maximize profit margin), or fuck even buy Thor’s battle axe and use it as a butt plug for all I care (we know after the past two weeks that’s about the only thing that will fucking fit). An unexpected revenue and earnings beat, as well as profitability, may absolutely send this thing to the stratosphere. Why is nobody talking about Reggie as well as our three wise men from RC Ventures??? 

As a side note there’s also a lot of new blood entering from this publicity. Be nice to them -we were all beginners at one time so answer their questions, as basic as they may seem. Also be careful about what DD’s you may read, they could be using this platform for their own malicious benefit rather than the good of the group. 

TL;DR - gamma squeeze made some people rich as fuck, may happen again next Friday but it also may not. Don’t be scared of consolidation next week. Buy some shit from GameStop in the next eight days. Squeeze has not been squozed. 

And finally, thank the O.G. GME gang for the hundreds, probably even thousands of hours they collectively put in to help us all.

Be patient, be well.

"GME Benefits 4 All (Children’s Hospital, Employees, and young customers in hard financial situations) 🚀🥜",0.98,"I’ve noticed a lot of users making similar threads and those are all wonderful. I’ve been trying to get attention to Children’s hospital for over a month but my efforts haven’t gotten any attention. I’m also including other people because of things I’ve seen whenever I’ve gone to GME stores. 

This post will include 4 scenarios where we can help out. (There are plenty on Autism already, just don’t do Autism Speaks)

You don’t have read all of them, just navigate to what interests you. 


1. Children’s Hospitals: This one is close to my heart, and a brief story about it will be included at the bottom. 

I’m buying [PUR Memberships ](https://ibb.co/CKmS9h0) on their behalf AFTER speaking with someone in charge and verifying etc. Full details at bottom. 

2. Sad side of GME: I’ve seen so many young customers come with their parents (usually minorities) and want to buy a product, but the parent realizes it is above what they were expecting and could afford. Given how small stores are, everyone in the store hears that and the kid is just embarrassed.


3. The employees, remember today is a pro day sale. Perfect time to drop by with pizza &amp;amp; goodies or something else. Shoutout to u/txbustanut but not everyone has to do something similar. It’s all relative, just like how many shares we can buy. 

4. Offer few $10 GC to random people (maybe even to customers who are in store today but aren’t pro members...they can use it and become one...)


#Speaking of shares

Never feel bad or ashamed that you can’t buy as some people on here. Buy anything you can, you don’t need to be a whale, you need to be an ant. Ever noticed how ants work together and carry big pieces of food? Well folks, we are all ants, some just bigger than others. Do your part, we break down walls, and we all feast together and can spread the wealth. 



Alright, I’m going to include my original post from after we went private but couldn’t post here...mainly because I’m going to own up to what I said about BB and PLTR. I was wrong about it, however, the money put into those would’ve still got more returns yesterday in GME and definitely going forward....


#1. Children’s Hospital

Call up your local children’s hospital, ask for the donations department and speak with them. 

#little story time

I have a cousin who had major health problems when he was 9, he spent most of the year in the children’s hospital. I spent many days taking care of my other cousin / his 8 year old brother when the parents were working. It wrecked havoc on their life, but nothing gets me more than seeing how it affected my cousins. 

The one in the hospital would question if he would be “normal” again. The other one that I would look after, one time he turned around and asked if God really exists, and if he did, why is he doing this. 

**Holy fuck, I was just in my 20s trying to bang chicks before Tinder**...I didn’t know how to handle situations like this. 


Anyways, now that I got your attention...

Ask the person in charge of the Donations / Children’s Lifea department of what’s acceptable etc.

If you’ve remembered my posts, I’ve always had plans of starting a mass donation / charity effort. 

Based on my conversation with the lady in charge of the department, this is what she said would be the best option for that specific location, yours may vary. 


I offered to have a PUR membership and give them a choice of digital vs physical copy of Game Informer. (**Digital would require every kid signing in to same account...so not a possibility and best to go with Physical.**)

 No this isn’t specific to GME, but if you’re playing 💎💎💎🚀🚀🚀.

If you’re not playing GME, you can still make some kid’s day. 

Anyways, the lady said physical copy would be best because they can decide who would be the best candidate to enjoy it. 

You can also use the hospital’s phone number and let them know to utilize the account’s certificates for toys etc. There’s usually quite a few stuff on clearance that they can pick up, or you can etc. 

Maybe you’ve got more tendies to spare, ask them if they would be interested in Nintendo switches or traditional consoles. Buy used ones...with warranty...so if something happens, they can easily be swapped out. 

Ultimately it’s about making some kid’s life a little better in the dark, alone, segregated (even more now with Covid) and miserable time they are going through. 

Love you all, even the 🌈🐻, the ones who think BB has a chance, and the PLTR buyers in end of Nov.




#2. Sad side of GME

##This applied to me...I experienced this growing up. 

I had to save up money at 9 ( $70 )to buy a GBC (seemed forever) and bought a N64 + 1 game when everybody else was buying newer consoles. That’s all I could afford with money I saved and how long it took me to get enough money. 

I love my parents, I’m grateful for them. They risked everything for me to come to America and have a chance at life. It’s hard to understand that a young age, but I am grateful for them and still grateful to have them. But at a young age and not being able to afford things that everyone else has...well it affects the kid.

Well it’s not because of GME, but GME’s tiny store and close proximity layout makes it more noticeable than any other store. 

Ever been in there, and you see a kid <14 come in with a parent? They come in for a product and the kid is excited, then the parent finds out the price and realizes that it was beyond what they were expecting. 


Needless to say, the whole store hears it and the kid is crushed and visibly affected by embarrassment. 

Anyways, it happens often, it may not be every time you go in, but I’ve noticed it too often. 

I’ve thought about offering to cover, but that would add on to the embarrassment of a stranger doing it in person...


So, how about making a great relationship with the store manager or lead etc, and offer to have a “special GC” for that reason. 

Fill it up with $50 or whatever you feel like on a monthly or however often / after big plays...and ask them to use a portion of it for such customers.

This shouldn’t be customer wanted $80 product but up sold them with $100 product and offer to cover $50 with that GC....


It should really be like “hey we’ve got a customer who has donated some money and we can cover the extra $15 here etc”

Thoughts?


#3. Employees: 

Goes without saying, they are the front line and face of the company to the average customer. Today is PRO day, even dropping by with pizza and drinks would make a huge difference. 


#4. Random people:

Buy 1 or a few $10 GC, offer them separately and different times / places for people to claim them for free. 

You’ve now made someone save $10, and they will use it towards something at GME. Let them know it was made possible with the PUR membership and now they can have their own rewards and benefits for only $5...customer for life. 


Thanks for reading, make your tendies in whatever ticker you want, but 💎💎 hand with GME because we haven’t even started the squeeze. PS I personally believe in the long haul 2023 turnaround....",2021-01-23 16:32:51

Tax Reduction Strategy for GME holders about to get bitch slapped by the IRS in 2021. Also a way to boost revenues to close out Q4 earnings (and beyond).,0.96,"Disclaimer: I am not a tax expert. This is just my retarded brain trying to think through this idea. I’m also not the first to propose this idea. Just remember I can’t read so I didn’t see those other posts. 

For those that have made mountains of sweet, sweet tendies from the GME 🚀🚀, I am wondering if the income tax increase that many of us will realize this year can be reduced by also helping our Tendiemaker directly. This is more specific to Itemized tax filers. If you file Standard, this will only benefit up to $300, which would still be a big deal if tons of us did this up to $300. Itemized filers can deduct up to 60% of their AGI.

Edit: it was brought up that the $300 deduction only applies if the cash donation is given directly to the charity. I’m not verifying it, but it sounds plausible enough.

So here it is. Everyone fortunate enough to be aboard this moon shot heads over to their local GME before 1/31, and we collectively buy what amounts to hopefully millions of dollars in GME gift cards. We take those gift cards and donate them to The Ronald McDonald House or a local Children’s Hospital (St. Jude’s is well known, but I would suggest keeping your donations local to help your community) for them to buy electronics for their patients and patient families. My wife works for a Children’s Hospital, and there are many “entertainment areas” packed with electronics throughout the hospital where sick children get a chance to escape the fight and reality of being sick. This is also an extraordinary relief for young family members of patients and parents as they can be occupied while their sibling or child undergoes tests or procedures or whatever.

We would be giving revenue a huge shot in the arm, give GME tons of cash to end Q4, and by donating the gift cards to local charities you can reduce the tax burden on your gainz. This will also be a way for us to change the narrative and show those currently besmirching the name of WSB that we aren’t an army, we aren’t some nefarious insider trading collective, nor are we the thieves we are being painted out to be. We’re just a bunch of smooth brains trying to make money or lose it all for the sake of sweet sweet internet points.

Doing this would also not only give you 🚀🚀🚀🚀 in your heart, but bless you with more 🚀🚀🚀🚀 when GME hits $1,000.

If my true retardation is missing any of the key points, please let me know where I am misinterpreting the tax code and I will gladly amend this post.

Position: 1,450 stonks, 4/16 $30c and 7/16 $35c

More obligatory rockets: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

TL:DR: Buy GME gift cards, donate them to The Ronald McDonald House or a local Children’s Hospital. Help sick children and their families. Reduce tax burden. Increase WSB love.",2021-01-23 16:08:49
Gme Infinite gamma squeeze explained,0.97,"Full disclosure, stolen from r/investing

Context

What happened last week with GME stock price and option was a combination of a gamma squeeze \[1\] and infinite short squeeze \[2\]. For the first time in financial history all GME call options are in the money (ITM) because the highest call strike price set by the CBOE for Januaray 29, 2021 is $60. Note: A primer on gamma squeeze: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme\_i\_think\_this\_is\_a\_gamma\_squeeze\_where\_dealers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/) Market Maker \[1\] are in a condition never observed in financial history. Hundred of thousands of retail are buying the GME 60C across the options calendar and MM can't hedge properly because there are not enough GME shares to buy to properly financially hedge (accounting for the interest rate to borrow)

Market Structure

To summarize the market structure:

Few GME shares to hedge.

Hundreds of thousands of are buying the GME 60C because of the infinite short squeeze.

January 29, 2021 60C call option are the highest one on the option change for that date.

Conditions for Infinite Gamma Squeeze & Infinite Short Squeeze

As you may now realize --(MM and brokers) hope you don't -- there is a gap in the market structure that leaves them (MM/Citadel) vulnerable to massive losses. Infinite Gamma Squeeze Should million of retails buy the Januray 29, 2021 60C weekly on Monday, this will create an infinite gamma squeeze because MM still can't properly hedge, and are forced to buy shares at whatever price to hedge. MM doing so, forces brokers to margin call the shorts caught in their infinite short squeeze. Both conditions are pro-cyclical and feed on each other in an infinite feedback loop so long as more an more retails buy the GME 60C. There is a chance that MM can dump the shares they bought to hedged the gamma steepening and call buying \[1\]. However, doing so does not make them market neutral. It effectively turns MM into a hedge fund. SEC may allow them to get away from this momentarily. However, after the MM dump shares in an attempt to stop the infinite gamma squeeze they will be net short GME shares and unhedged/not market neutral. If after the MM dump, retails continue to buy GME shares up to the $60 price, MM will be caught in a exponentially worse gamma squeeze, which should GME go pass 60C (gamma bump) on the week of January 25, it would turn into the one of biggest tail risk event for the MM/Citidal. tldr; There is a gap in the market structure so that if millions of retails buy Januray 29 GME 60C on January 25 2021, there is a high probability of both an infinite gamma and short squeeze. This has never happened in financial history. And should millions of retail buy the January 29 GME60C 2021, the losses for MM but profits for retail will be massive. Retails could see 100000% return on their weekly GME Januray 29 call options at the highest strike price. Edit1: Apparently there may be higher call prices for the January 29 2021 option chains. Fundamentally, this analysis is still correct. Should millions of retail all choose a common higher call strike price to buy (higher than 60C), the gamma squeeze will be triggered when that prices is hit. Example: Should millions of retail buy the January 29 70C or January 29 75C, and the infinite short squeeze continues. If the GME 70C or 75C is hit, GME share price enters a gamma squeeze. What the MM are hoping for are twofolds:

They scare retails to sell below $60. This alleviates the infinite gamma squeeze. Or;

Retails don't all buy the same call options. But given that retail loves high risk, I hypothesize they will all choose the furthest OTM call options.

GME at 60 is the Maginot line next week. Should it go to 75, gamma and infinite short squeeze continues. Should it fall below it, MM have won a strategic victory. Edit2: For gamma squeeze, you look at the open interest (OI) and strike price. Should the share price get close to the price with a highest open interest, that's when the gamma steepening occurs as probability goes to 1. MM have to buy shares to remain neutral as the options are now ITM.

GME Technical Price Action Analysis (Supply and Demand),1.0,"Not seeing many posts on technical analysis for GME. I have typed this post real slow as I know you retards dont read fast.

TLDR/: Price action is still bullish **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

I will explain some Technical Analysis through the lens of supply and demand. We read S&D by looking at volume. Volume is the single most important metric on your chart as it explains S&D and we all know from Economics 101 S&D will determine price (which is then usually driven by value or the perception of value but in this case its driven by a bunch of lunatics).

As price moves up demand decreases and as price moves down Supply decreases. Equilibrium is found where S&D are balanced at a point where Sellers and Buyers agree on a price. If however for example demand increases as price moves up the whole Demand curve (red line) will shift up the blue line and a new higher equilibrium price will be found.

Watching yesterdays price action and volume it was clear the stock was very bullish. For the last 4 years or so I have been in training with an institutional quant / trader and we are taught to ask the following questions.

1. What did the market do with volume, and
2. What did it do with liquidity.

&#x200B;

[Price Action - 21st Jan](https://preview.redd.it/ia1bwr2ft3d61.png?width=1524&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0a592116761382f98cf4a3f69a42a0aa5e752b1)

1. **Volume** \- Look for the highest volume candles on the chart and see if price continued or if the candle reversed . On Thurs we see the highest volume candles are all down selling candles however they where all reversed (see the candles labelled with the red i.e. the selling volume was bought and not only was it bought it was most probably bought by large institutions as they are the ones with the order books to stop the market like that. Institutions do not buy at the market but rather on the limit and they buy in large quantities so they need volume. They either need to generate that volume through price action market manipulations enticing sellers into the market, or they buy when the see volume increasing on the books. They do not what the market to move before they have finished their accumulation so they enter at the limit at enough volume as to absorb as much as they can without scaring the price higher. They might even cap the markets upside keeping the price low so the can accumulate. So they buy 1000 and as price comes up the sell 500 to push the price back down, rinse and repeat, this is why accumulation patterns look like this..

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qbxsmman64d61.png?width=769&format=png&auto=webp&s=6458dc2462e551ec2edf4cf4190dd92842aa8536

1. **Liquidity** \- There will be liquidity for the large players to accumulate as the round numbers and above or below pivot points. Institutions know where retarded traders like to keep their stops, they keep them right above / below pivots. The biggest issue for institutions is finding enough volume to fill their books. Now they want to buy low just like everyone else but as we know from S&D they lower you go the more buyers you will find not more sellers. For the institutions to fill their books they need to find SELLERS at lower price from whom they can buy. But why would anyone sell at a lower price (its less profitable for sellers). Therefore the best place to find sellers at lower prices is by finding the buyers stops. If the institutions can run the stops those buyers have to become sellers. So look for what happens when price goes above or below a pivot point. If price immediately goes back inside the pivot we know that that liquidity was bought (or sold). On the chart we see that everything price went below a pivot point (green boxes) it immediately bounced back inside showing that the liquidity was being bought. This also coincides with the high volume candles. So listen up retards to do not keep your stops in these areas as they will get run over leaving you on the sidelines watching as price moons.

&#x200B;

Lets have a look at the todays price action. GME opened bullish. The opening candle is an important level and should be marked. Its a good area to either buy or sell depending on your bias. There where two opps to buy at the red arrows. As price starts going up, buying volume keeps increasing, this shouldn't happen according to our S&D dynamics. When we see this we know that the market keeps finding more buyers at higher prices. This encourages the institution as their biggest fear is being able to get rid of their stock (ie finding buyers at higher prices that they can SELL to).

We have the rejection of the $76 level and price retraces to the 50% level. This is an important level of defence for the buyers. On the way back to the 50 we see the high volume candles being bought with the highest selling volume for the day being completely reversed. This shows the buyers are still engaged. The safest trade for is to wait for price to retrace back to and test the liquidity below that high vol candle. This is tested and bought on high volume showing institutional interest in the stock and once you see price start going back up above the pivot this is where you should buy. This is a very safe trade. The buy was also off the moving VWAP again an important metric for the institutions who want to buy below the VWAP. Many traders bonuses are calculated on this.

Later on we see buying volume increasing again as prices rise.

Lastly for the Market Profile guys we can see buyers have emerged above the POC as price has gone bullish.

&#x200B;

Conclusion - Price action says its bullish. Two price targets that the institutions will target if we get above and hold 76. 1st one is 95-96 and second one is 110 - 115, watch for reactions. Those are not exact but rather an area for profit taking. Not necessarily the end.",2021-01-23 15:59:48

$BB: Why the shills are wrong,0.57,"Seeing all this bullshit shilling on $BB lately. Where were all these idiots when [I posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7y1ou/retard_confession_bear_to_defensive_bull/) about it while it was trading at $4.xx? They were too smoothbrained to see the potential until the Amazon deal was announced in December.

Now they're trying to get you to triple it again by drawing false comparisons to HIGH GROWTH companies like CRWD, SNOW, and even TSLA. Except BlackBerry has [no growth](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cantechletter.com/2020/12/blackberry-is-no-tesla-this-investor-says/amp/). So, these assholes will sell out to you before earnings when this reality hits.

Blackberry is not the next GME either, because it doesn't have many shorts. In fact, Andrew Left from Citron is [long](https://citronresearch.com/blackberry-next-nvidia/) on it. So there's no short squeeze coming.

Don't get me wrong, I'm long. But don't throw away all your earnings from blowing your wife's boyfriend. $BB will not triple or quadruple again this year. Buy shares or LEAP's if you really have a hard on for it.

TLDR: BlackBerry has no growth and no potential for a short squeeze. It already more than tripled and is no longer undervalued. I've been long since [May last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7y1ou/retard_confession_bear_to_defensive_bull/).",2021-01-23 15:47:51

They are telling, it will be hard to short any GME shares in upcoming weeks in case I got assigned for my short leg of bull spread.

For the retards, who needs more words: I own 30 25calls and I shorted 30 35calls. It gives me less theta exposure and keeps my losses and gains to a limit. If the buyer of 35 calls decide to exercise their contracts, IBKR needs to buy GME shares on my behalf and give those to the actual contract holder, which makes me a borrower.

Why this is important?- Probably IBKR is sending this notification to all relevant customers who shorted. I hope those will panic and try to cover next week- The broker can see short ratio, borrow cost, etc more accurately and they also believe the squeeze is inevitable, so they try to protect their retard customers.

Blowjobs and Bentleys,0.92,"Boy what a time to be alive. $GME straight dumping tits on the tutes and Elon seemingly poised to found the next planet before any government.....and we thought 2020 was chaotic!

Regardless, there is one thing that doesn't change, and thats fat ass fatties and the potential to profit off their fat disgraceful asses with $VKTX and $MDGL

America (and the world) is in the midst of an obesity epidemic, this is known. But what most fail to realize is that coupled to this largesse problem is also skyrocketing rates of liver failure. From drinking away their fat ass sorrows? From having such a high tolerance that only a 30-rack of Natty Daddies will do the trick? No. The short answer is NASH.

Non-Alcoholic Steateohepatits (NASH) is a disease of the liver caused by a high fat diet that leads to both 1) Steatosis (fat build up in the liver) and 2) hepatitis (chirosis or scarring of the liver). Left untreated, simply put, you die. It is a ""Live""-er after all.

For decades the leading rate of liver transplant has been the doggedly persistent inveterate booze hounds we all know and love....until (predicted) this year. Soon NASH from the fats will outpace alcoholic induced need for a liver transplant and, worse yet, there is currently no approved treatment except diet and exercise (and we all know how that goes).

Currently an estimated 1/4 of the world population is at risk, and with the first Fat Ass Generation *cough* boomer *cough* fast approaching the age of ""terminal illnesses"" there is a huge unmet need for treatments regarding NASH. $50 billion market in fact.

That's where the Blowjobs and Bentleys comes in. No, not as a revolutionized form of Hospice where you high speeds and road head allow you to go out on top. Thyroid Beta Agonists is the key.

There have been many players in the NASH market, and most have failed. None, however, have attacked NASH at its source, that is the livers ability to process fat and overall fat content of the liver. Instead, most drugs that have failed have sought to reverse the fibrosis and scaring of the liver, hoping that in doing so its capacity to process Big Macs and Papa John's-esque diet of 40 pizzas in 40 days would be revitalized.

Thyroid Beta Agonists, however work by directly lowering the livers level of steatosis (fat content) and they seemingly do so by enhacing the capacity of the liver to process a high fat diet. Best yet, unlike previous top line candidates with side effects such as premature death and intense itching and (funnily enough) high cholesterol and blood lipids, these drugs have very few side effects and seem to actually lower blood triglycerides.

Of note is that only NASH itself is $50 billy.....thats not including the precursor of NASH...Fatty Liver Disease.....that an exorbitant percent of the US population lives with.

True indeed, we could be talking about the next ""blood pressure medication"" but with the added benefit of 21st century price gouging. Tendies galore!

The two lead candidates for NASH, without further ado, are $VKTX and $MDGL. Both have had top line results in recent liver biopsy studies, with $VKTX in the end stages of a phase 2b and $MDGL in the end stages of their first phase 3 study.

With markets at an all time high and the potential for a positive study any day and the stellar results of these drug candidates I can't think of a better buy. Check it out for yourself. 

Until next time, when we discuss the new market for ""Blowjobs and Bentleys Hospice Care""

GME - Short Squeeze Power Level 9000,0.96," 

Disclaimer: **please check my work**, not an advisement to buy or sell or anything, etc. Just recording what I'm seeing, hope it's correct.  
(note to mods: original post contained banned tickers just by way of comparison - removed in this version, inclusion not important to thesis)

**Attention retards:** After Friday's short bloodbath I wanted to see if we'd made it through the squeeze for now and if all the low-hanging fruit had been shaken out. **Apparently not.** In fact, it's looking even harder for the shorts to borrow now.

Since [iborrowdesk.com](https://iborrowdesk.com/) only updates once a day in the morning for GME, I went to IBKR to check to see if the data there was more current. Turns out that yes, it had updated as of 1/23 and lo and behold, our **power level is 9000.**

**🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

**GME|USD|GAMESTOP CORP-CLASS A|36285627|XXXXXXXW1099|-32.6198|32.6998|9000|**

32% interest to borrow rate, 9000 shares available according to IBKR. That's $585,000 worth of available stock to short at Friday's closing price - 0.0129% of its total market cap.

According to the chart at [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME), this was down from 1,200,000 shares as recently as 1/18, one of only 4 times in the last 3 months that many shares had been available. The squeeze last week plowed right through that firewall. Now it's gone.

**What I think:** This is going to be a very long weekend for short sellers to think over whether they want to keep up their strategy. We could be looking at another monster squeeze in the next week if the momentum continues and the big boys start unloading their positions. The pressure cooker hasn't even been turned on yet - my thinking is that we're heading to the Oort Cloud.

**Disclaimer:** I \*assume\* most ITM calls that get exercised this week aren't going to be available to short following the weekend - although I could be wrong.

"GME Storytime, DD, and...🚀🚀🚀🚀🥜🥜🥜",0.87,"**Intro**

I just got home from seeing an escort (I swear to god I told her to buy GME stock), have a migraine, and am high. So typos and shit gonna happen yo. 



**Storytime**

So, I'm a smooth brain, like the rest of you. Sometimes I think:  
""Hey, maybe I'm a little smarter than the average person right, anyway I can use that?""

 Well typically no if you're like me, doing Uber Eats and being too smoothbrain to trade stocks good. I just do my day job, and then get high, then go to sleep. 

It is finally time for us mediocre IQ retards to get rewarded for being not-quite-so-dumb as the wiseass MMs. 



**DD**

We're basically pawns in the game of MMs, but the chips are in our favor. Other MMs know the shorts have to cover too, so giant MMs can buy the shares and sit on them. They're not losing money, but they know the short will have to cover. Even if GME sold shit sandwiches, it doesn't matter. They can sit on the stock, and wait for the shorts to cover and it wouldn't be a bad play. 

But GME actually has a LOT going for it, and some really interesting ideas about the future of digital game purchases. (Digital trade-in marketplace and whatnot). So that's not even a downside. Don't forget about Mr 🥜 himself. 

So at this point, it's a game of chicken, but the higher the stock goes, the sooner it pops. Well now people are starting to learn what is going on here. People on other reddit boards, people on the street, everyone is starting to learn about this stock. If it becomes a KNOWN fact that shorts have to cover, regular joes will buy in until it happens. It's another TSLA lottery ticket, people fucking love those. What they don't know is that this train doesn't go down, it only goes up 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

NOW because of this catalyst, the margin call is a very likely possibility which will force the pop and this happens SOON, possibly as soon as next week. 

I, like the next retard, wish I was 100% shares and to quadruple my 250k into a million and be done with being a wagie. But I'm basically broke, so I'm 50/50 shares and options, I MUST do my part. 





**TLDR**

We're just along for the ride of shorts getting burned, this kind of stock shorting won't happen again after GME. Even if this IS a pump and dump, or even if it IS a bubble, people want the lottery ticket and people are going to sit on it until shorts pop.

Why Nokia is due for a moon landing 🚀🚀,0.89,"Nokia has been on everyone’s radar as a future 5G play for awhile but hasn’t moved. I think it’s mainly stayed stagnant because of its perception as a failing boomer stock.. 

What we’ve seen this week is the rise of perceived “failing” boomer stocks with GameStop, BlackBerry and GM heading straight into orbit 🚀🚀🚀

It’s only logical to think with the past interests in Nokia that never developed, the low price tag and the amount of autist who will be looking for the next meme stock after $BB and $GME. Nokia is the next up for a trip to the moon 🌚 🚀

Some actual DD 

•Nokia just announced that they have been running successful test of their 5g technology in China and the Middle East 

• Announced a 5g cyber security deal with T Mobile

• NOK's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 18.53. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 19.29, which means NOK is trading at a discount to the group


So yeah TL:DR Undervalued stock, lots of potential, similar to last couple meme stocks, so it’s too the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

callawaY tOpgLOf - DD ($ELY),0.87,"Hello fellow retards, this is my **DD** for **Callaway Golf** \- TICKER **$ELY**

&#x200B;

**Company overview** **🚀**

To most people, Callaway is a boomer company that manufacturers and sells golf clubs, balls and accessories. It also has a couple lifestyle brands under its portfolio that nobody on the street gives two shit about. Despite its strong balance sheet, market share dominance and a consistent growth in revenue, this stock has never caught the attention of modern investors due to its retail business model and a very limited total addressable market. According to a 2017 US survey, about 24 million people participated in playing golf. But only 8.8 million of these participants are said to be avid golfers. Pretty pathetic right?? You know what's not pathetic? **TOP** 👏 **MUTHA** 👏 **FUKING** 👏 **GOLF** 👏

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Top Golf** **🚀**

On a fateful Tuesday of October, 2020. Callaway announced a $2 billion pure stock acquisition of Topgolf. You know…. the ""fancy"" place you go to to impress your Tinder dates fully knowing that neither of you dumb fucks has ever held a club in your entire life but you still ended up getting laid. Yeah not only is Topgolf a good wingmen but also it’s a **$4 billion** dollar company(reported in Jan by Bloomberg during its initial IPO evaluation) with:

* **23 million unique customers** (2019)
* 70% are under the age of 34 ( TAM EXPANSION BOIIIZ!)
* 51% are nongolfers and 75% of the nongolfers are interested in actually playing golf…hmmm I wonder where they are going to buy their clubs
* 94% of guests are likely to return
* **1.1 billion revenue (2019)** with a **30%** compound annual growth
* **Bringing tech to the boomer world**
* Top tracer technology - highly scalable with huge licensing potential
* Monetized video game with 30 million members
* Digital golf suite for urban areas
* CEO **DOLF BERLE** responsible for the success of David and Busters
* **Global domination**
* 58 US venues and 5 international venues
* Average revenue of **17 million** per venue
* About to break ground in Mexico and Dubai
* Their food actually taste good and they sell a ungodly amount of **alcohol**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Vertical Integration** **🚀**

This is a vertical Integration like no others. Not only does Top Golf exponentially expand Callaway's TAM but also allows Callaway to push their entire line of products into the most popular golf clubs in the world. Imagine you're a soft drink company and you just signed the exclusive rights to sell your beverages at McDonalds. SERIOUSLY out of the **$80+ billion** golf industry, Callaway TOPGOLF will be **#1 in every fucking categor**y they are poised to become the **Luxottica of the golf world**:

· NUMBA 1 Equipment sales **🚀**

· NUMBA 1 Apparel sales**🚀**

· NUMBA 1 Entertainment experiences**🚀**

· NUMBA 1 Proprietary tech**🚀**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Debt issue? Fuck no** **🚀**

· With the merger, Callaway is also assuming Top Golf's **$500M debt**.

· As of Q3 2020 Callaway has amassed over **$630M of cash** nearly $300M higher than same period in 2019.

· They are also **near-complete with all Callaway related investments** and has more than enough resources to pay down Top Golf's debt and continue to invest.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Value🚀**

As of now ELY has a market cap of **$2.73 billion**. When taken into consideration of stock dilution after the merger completes, the total market cap of Callaway Topgolf would be around **$5.3 billion**. Considering their 2019's combined revenue of over **$2.7 billion** and a conservative year over year growth of at least **10%** and every fucking thing I've just said above.... this stock is a steal.

The only issue right now is that it **lacks volume**. I get it…its not as sexy as some of the other trendy stocks on this sub. But it’s the kind of value stock that would give Buffet a **huge erection**. So I implore you fellow retards of WSB to bring some of your GME tendies to the Callaway train. Make this ticker mainstream and take us to the fuCKING MOOOOOOOOOOON! **🚀** **🌙**

**TLDR**: Think of this stock as a under hyped and under valued IPO for Topgolf. Strong balance sheet, absolute market dominance, huge growth potential with a proven record, buy buy buy.",2021-01-23 06:09:26

The Big Squeeze feat. Dr. Michael Fuckin' Burry & u/DFV (Big Short Sequel),0.98,"I remember back in the early pandemic days perusing Scion Asset Management's 13F's and seeing his two biggest holdings were two sub $3.00 turd stocks: Tailored Brands and ... fucking GameStop. This was 10 months ago but it feels like a fuckin eternity...but I distinctly remember thinking wtf is he doing..

In light of today's giant WSBgasm I thought it would be interesting to get high and recap how the shoeless wonder pulled his second act, along with the help of all you retards.

Enjoy.

Also, this story should absolutely be the sequel to The Big Short. \[Get this narrative to Paramount\]

He opened the position with [536k shares](https://sec.report/Document/0001567619-19-004198/form13fInfoTable.html) back in December 2018. GME was sliding from $14 to $12ish here.

By spring 2019 it had slid to $11/sh, so he added to the position to make it a cool [650k](https://sec.report/Document/0001567619-19-010955/). \[Note: it was Scion's 4th smallest position, but still $6.6 mil\]

By the end of June he [sold it all](https://sec.report/Document/0001567619-19-016689/). GME was down to $5.50/sh, so he was down about 50% on the position.

***Big dick returns***: in Sep '19 he buys 3,000,000 shares. GME @ $4.5. *He knew.* Cohen didn't buy in til $15.

Dec '19: Sells 650k shares, still holds [2.35 million](https://sec.report/Document/0001567619-20-003530/). GME @ $6/sh. #TrustTheDoc

April 2020: PANDEMIC IN FULL SWING. Dr. B drops a [13D](https://sec.report/Document/0000905148-20-000491/) that he now owns 5.3% of GME's total shares. Holding 3.4 million shares. GME @ $3/sh. Lot of WSBers were debating whether this would go out of business (the OG's remember this). GameStop B&M locations were [fighting for their life](https://www.fanbyte.com/trending/gamestop-essential-coronavirus-covid/) to be ""essential"" businesses. It was a scary time to be long GME, and took some balls to load up.

A month later homeboy clipped 85% gains with GME @ $5.30-$5.75. Keeps [2.8 million](https://sec.report/Document/0000905148-20-000563/) shares.

June 2020: GME @ $4.50/sh. Still 💎🤲 2.8 million shares.

Sep 2020: GME @ $10.00/sh. [Closes out a million shares](https://sec.report/Document/0000905148-20-000563/). *Follow the process*. Literal autism.

GME closes 2020 just over $20/sh.

Burry holds 1.7 million fucking shares. Cost basis of $3/sh.

With all due respect to u/DeepFuckingValue, with his $14.89 cost basis, Burry had 34x as many shares and 1/4 the cost basis. **Holy. Fucking. Shit.**

If he held every share Burry's position would be worth $105,400,000 today.

DFV still built his stake to $11,175,979 with the calls. Hitting 10% of Burry's estimated gains is respectable as fuck.  u/DeepFuckingValue is a legend in the anals of wsb history.

Anyways, just thought you losers would enjoy this since I know you're already jones'ing for Monday morning.

Bears have seen more than $3.3 billion mark-to-market losses this year, according to the financial analytics firm.

1) You CANT time the market. Stop trying to convince yourself youre a divine being that couldve dumped today at 77 and bought back at 56. That type of thinking is straight up moronic, well below retarded even and more primitive than autistic. If you think like this and cant shake it off, fuck off to your wife boyfriend's family farm and try to build a time machine to travel back in time and buy penny stocks that exploded. You might as well since you love wasting time mentally masturbating.

2) The ONLY way to prevail is BUY and HOARD shares for GME. Youre either BUYING or HOLDING !!! SIMPLE. We're sitting on a fucking ticking time rocket headed towards the darkest corners of the universe and Papa Cohen's thrusters still havent deployed 🚀🚀🚀🚀. Selling shares at any point along the way is plain stupid. Oh but wait, your GME portfolio is in the red? You bought at 75? Want to still make money 🚀🚀? Its simple, the greek like Aristotle, Socrates, and Plato figured it out for you. It's called ""Cost Averaging"". Retarded like me? Ill explain:

If you bought 100 shares @ 64, you spent 64$/share. BUT WAIT, stonks sometimes go down before going to alpha centauri 🚀🚀🚀🚀 what do you do? Do you panic and sell low while you bought high? Absolutely fucking not, thats beta paper handing and gets you nowhere. You literally locked in a loss at that point. Dont be that paper handed sissy. You alpha up and BUY more shares when it tanks! If it goes down to 56$, you buy 100 shares. What happened? Look at that! You NOW have 200 shares that averaged 60$/share. When it goes to 70$ youll be printing benjamin franklins like JPow on a COVID day 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Boys were headed to Alpha Fucking Centuari 🚀🚀🚀 on an intergalactic space mission 🚀 and its naive to think we wont stop along the way here and there. The ups and downs everyday are to the advantage of MMs and shorts who are shaking of paper hands.

Short $GME DD for those that think it reached its peak historical value today,0.96,"It didn't.

Technically, the stock price did yes. The market cap didn't. The company was actually worth more in the past.  


For the autists that don't know, definition of market cap from [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/02/041702.asp):

""Market capitalization refers to how much a company is worth as determined by the stock market. It is defined as the total market value of all outstanding shares.""  


You calculate this by taking the outstanding number of shares and multiplying it by the  stock price.

 = \~69,750,000 x 75 (price near peak) = \~$5.2B  


So for the scared 🧻✋ thinking the company value reached its historical peak today or for those that read the influx of media articles citing ""GME reaching all time highs"" today trying to scare you to think a correction is imminent, it didn't. The company value was worth \~9.8 billion in 2007 and \~6.5 billion in 2013  (Source: [market trends](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/market-cap))

This is because the company used its money to purchase back a significant number of its shares (roughly \~75%) between July 2019 and January 2020 (Source: [ycharts](https://ycharts.com/companies/GME/stock_buyback)).

tldr;

* Gamestop was worth more in the past than it is at the peak today.
* Company's peak historical values in 2007 and 2013 put it today at a share price today of $140 and $93 respectively.
* This was before Ryan Cohen, before e-commerce, before squeeze. E-commerce companies tend to become valued higher.
* This is why bulls see a share price in the $100-$200 range attainable without a squeeze; and why higher squeeze estimates are realistic more than they are wishful thinking.

Mods have created a false narrative that the GME play is done for by making GME gains threads posts (who could this benefit??? Think critically.) Meme stocks mooning upon GME halt, RH WSBers did not move a 56.7B cap (PLTR) that fast upon halt, along with BB/AMC/? shortly thereafter. Who would it benefit to pump these stocks and take eyes off of GME upon halt? Think. Paper-handed fucks posting realized gains, bots talking about selling. Think about it, nothing is coincidental here. This play is no where near done. You paper-handed fucks will rue the day that this hits high triple/four digits.

I'm not shitting you. Price action today looked to be largely result of a gamma squeeze (MM's selling smooth-brains their FD's, MM's think FD no chance be ITM, MM's not buy a lot shares hedge, uh-oh FD's ITM MM's buy lot shares to stay delta-neutral). This means short-int is still high as fuck (AKA the highest % in history). This means unprecedented possibility in terms of price. Do not fucking sell. Do not fucking buy options. Hold shares! No more of this paper-handed bullshit.

Numerous meme stocks pump upon GME halt -> maybe draw a bit of a certain group elsewhere? Coincidentally, they pump when it halts, when gains threads are posted, and when threads are unpinned. Hint: us small guys don't move fast enough to pump that quickly upon halt. These guys are hurting, bad. Hold.

TLDR: Fuck off with the BB/PLTR shite, diamond hands GME.

"GME, What is the actual endgame? Theories inside",0.71,"Obligatory  🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀

So I have a couple theories on how this can all play out.  This has to end at some point as the stock can't go to infinity.  We can all say that we want it to but something has to happen.

**First Endgame: Gamestop offers new shares for sale**

This would obviously fuck our shit hard and honestly it makes a lot of sense for the brand.  They reported $673M in long term debt as of the Q3 2020 earnings report.  If they wanted to wipe out that debt they could, at the current price of $65.01, issue 10M shares.  Those shares would not only dilute the share value but give the shorts some of the shares they need to cover.  I mean, 10M shares would still give over 100% of available float shorted, not that big of a deal.

But they also have $1.6B worth of short term debt or liabilities.  The total for both would be about $2.27B or equal to  35M shares.  This is half of the shares shorted and our MOASS would be a thing of the past and moving all of us back into fighting for upvotes with our loss porn.

Things I don't know: How much of a follow on offering do companies usually give?  Could they even fill the offering if the asked for the whole 35M shares?

I hope that Ryan Cohen brought his bros onto the board so they could vote against an additional share offering but who knows.  Cohen probably believes in the brand more than the short squeeze so maybe they are going to use the squeeze to get more cash with less shares.

**Second Endgame: Cohen sells his shares and backs out**

I think this is the least likely of the options as Cohen isn't a trader but a venture capitalist.  He builds companies not stock portfolios.  If he was to sell his 9M shares and run it would send a shockwave through the shareholders that would rival an ass-clap on Kim Kardashian.  Not only would it sink the company (probably) but it would also sink the squeeze.  Lets all pray to God this doesn't happen.

**Third Endgame: SEC steps in and forces... something**

I am not even sure what they could force.  Could they force brokerages to swallow the cost, but how and at what price/share?  Could they force GME to offer shares?  Whatever they might decide will probably leave the retail traders holding the bag (as we always do).  Anybody have an idea?

All I know is that if Gamestop doesn't offer new shares and Cohen stays, this event will change the way stocks are traded going forward.  This is history boys and I am glad to be a part of it.

Positions: 770 shares

Plan: add more shares and buy some puts for hedging (it has to end sometime)

P.S. 🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀 I know this was a downer but I'M RIDING THIS FUCKING ROCKET UNTIL IT EXPLODES!!!!

Edit: My assumption is that the squeeze can run forever (margin calls drive up price which drives margin calls) but something will stop it.

# 🚀🚀🚀 What is next? 🏌️ CALLaway $ELY 🏌️ 🚀🚀🚀

We are poised for a 30% growth rate since 2017 and that number is not going to stop, as the company is still MOONing and expanding its venues

To quote [u/Healthy-Cash8610](https://www.reddit.com/u/Healthy-Cash8610/)

>For my analysis, I projected Callaway and Topgolf's revenues out to 2025 with the above-mentioned projected growth rates, and came to a combined revenue estimate of $6.63B in 2025. I then discounted this revenue back to current year at 15% to get a number of about $3.3B. With ELY currently trading at a P/S ratio of 1.51, this would imply a target market cap of about $4.98B with the discounted revenues and the current P/S ratio. The current market cap of ELY with the stock trading at $27/share is $2.54B. Based on my analysis this gives a potential upside of 96% with a price target of $52.85. 🚀🚀

If you are pussies who didn’t get onboard $GME, quoting [u/FatVegain](https://www.reddit.com/u/FatVegain/)

>GME is a literal war for the future of retail investors, so I’m holding my shares strong. Fuck short sellers. But $ELY is a definite steal right now considering Top Golf alone is worth $2 billion. Share price should double to realize it’s true marketcap. I think this will gain some momentum very quickly. Glad to find this gem before it catches up to its value. 🚀🚀

It has good fundamentals too

>I think $ELY is one of the better ones as it actually has a solid investment case vs just being picked because it has a high short interest ratio

Now I’m the only one getting onboard this. My fellow $GMEers & $BBers all know how undervalued this stock is. We are absolutely going for a ride up the moon once earnings are released on Feb.

While we are all extremely excited that a lot of people are making money these days, and right now you can almost throw a dart at a dartboard and land on something that will  🚀, if you do not know what you are doing, you are playing a HIGH RISK GAME AND YOU WILL LOSE MONEY.  AND POTENTIALLY LOTS OF MONEY.  MAYBE ALL OF IT.  It's happened throughout history, over and over again.

The folks that play this game and consistently make a ton of money at it are very good at what they do.  They have a lifetime of experience, understanding, and tools at their disposal that we do not have.  I am a finance major, a business owner, and over 15 years in basic investing, and I still get walloped from time to time.  I've got nothing on those guys, or the brilliant minds on this thread.

Please make sure you are messing around with money you can afford to lose.  Yes, I am in BB, GME, and a bunch of others, but I'm playing around with money that won't hurt me if I lose.

Some of the folks on here are putting up their rent money, college money, life savings, and grandma's disability check on BETS without understanding how much risk they are actually taking.  While we all want Melvin to suffer, look out for your fellow man.  There's nothing wrong with owning SOME index funds, and the ones I own are making money as well.

EDIT 2:  WOW!  I did not expect this to get a lot of attention.  I'm glad that a few people took note and for everyone else looking out, that's one of the reasons I like this sub!  I want to reiterate - if you understand the above, if you understand the roaring 20s and the Great Depression, and you accept the risks with your YOLO, that's fine!  This is for the ever growing crowd that thinks 10-15% gains is NORMAL, and that they can leverage themselves to the teeth to become the next DFV overnight.  These people clearly DO NOT understand the risks, and therefore deserve a quick heads up.

I've received some messages asking where to start.  That's great.  Here's what I would suggest:

Youtube and Google are your friends.  Anything you read that you don't understand (Calls, puts, shorts, float, squeeze - Google IT).  Start with WHAT A SHARE OF STOCK ACTUALLY REPRESENTS, and that you are paying a price for a small percentage of ownership in that company and its current (or potential/eventual) profits.  Start with BASIC company valuation - learn about market cap, PE ratios, P/S ratios.  Learn how to read an income statement and balance sheet.  Make sure companies have a path to profitability if they are not making money.  With this knowledge, you can start to understand for yourself if a company is potentially over or undervalued.  Start with what companies you know and understand what they are selling, along with trends that you know and understand. When you start getting into stuff that you don't understand or see the vision for, you're just along for the ride.  Trial by fire and just getting into it is fine (I learn constantly from my own mistakes and practice makes perfect), but make it a very small percent of what you have. Buy partial shares. Also, realize you will need to probably buy and hold many stocks...it won't just happen overnight. Recent MEME stocks are an exception. When that happens, awesome. But it's rarely like that.  GL and have fun with it too.  ",2021-01-23 04:34:06

Pain and guilt. ... possibly takes time to set in once the price starts trading flat

Anger and bargaining. ... When GME goes up again and threats for class action market manipulation lawsuits come in to play. It’s not market manipulation when you decide to go in on the wrong end of the trade.

Depression. ... silence, for a long time, ignoring tweets, making more failed shorts

The upward turn. ... calming down

Reconstruction and working through. ... when GameStop gets hiked in price target and institutional investors start buying to hold.

Acceptance and hope.

Thank you GME and WSB,0.97,"During the pandemic my family has been struggling financially, but GME has allowed me (a 17 yr old) to take my family out to a nice restaurant and help purchase an iphone SE for my sister.

I have been a member of WSB for awhile and have played around with small amounts of money, losing some by joining the msft 3/20 gang and tanker gang. Around november I saw some GME DD's and did my own research too. After doing so I deposited all my savings (1000$) into GME.

The recent rise has allowed me to help out my family a bit financially, doing a few nice things recently like taking them out to dinner or helping with gifts

Thank you so much GME gang and WSB for all of this :)

The answer my friends is RYCEY or Rolls Royce. No you fool, not the car company. Rolls Royce is the one of the largest aircraft engine producers in the world supplying customers in over 103 countries. (including Virgin Galactic) Additionally, they have their hands in electric aircraft, mini nuclear power systems, nautical engines, and artificial intelligence. RYCEY knows their stuff and has been around for ages. Due to COVID-19, the stock is down over 80% from $8 down to $1.50. (YOU CAN OWN A PIECE OF ROLLS ROYCE FOR THE COST OF A MCCHICKEN) As the vaccines roll out around the world, this bad boy is primed to explode. To put it into perspective, their revenue last year was roughly 15B and their market cap is currently only 12B. They have over 9B in cash and are set to turn profit mid 2021.

I’ve been seeing a lot of new post that are screaming paper handed bullshit, especially from people with less than $1k invested. Everything helps but don’t fuck over the guys who have done the research for you and are looking to make +100k for your +1k profit. I get Wsb is known for its “meme” stocks but this is different, this has the potential to bring in a lot of money. Do some research on GME and the short squeeze before you invest. By selling low you will be allowing the shorts to be covered for little to compared to what we can ask. They are literally being held hostage by share owners, we can theoretically ask for any amount of money and they will have to pay. That being said, this situation definitely warrants +$1000 a share. When the squeeze starts you will start seeing profits, youve never seen before, your portfolio will be flying up, ur heart will start racing and you will be very nervous. You will sell at $200/share and make some fair profit. Two hours later that share price will be over $1000. You just missed out on 5x the profits. You took hundreds or thousands instead of tens of thousands. Ya you just made profit but you will still feel like shit. 

All I can tell you is DONT FUCKING SELL. THIS IS THE FREEST MONEY I HAVE EVER SEEN. BUY THE DIPS AND DO NOT SELL. +$1000/SHARE NOTHING LESS🚀🚀🚀

The average retard's DD on GME and why I'm holding,0.94,"As you are all aware, it appears that this sub and a combined force of “retail investors” who have been historically taken advantage of by the big-name players in the market struck back today. 

And we struck back hard. 

And you know what, at this point, I no longer care if GME continues with its rally or not.

Whatever it was today, call it the short squeeze, gamma squeeze, or orange squeeze, it doesn’t matter.  
We did what we said we would do, and we accomplished what we said we would. 

It was to the point where all them big players were clearly sweating.   
Every hit piece released today was in a very pessimistic tone, calling us a mob or some other names.  
Some boomer shit came out and suggested SEC needed to monitor this subreddit, for reasons that… who the fuck knows. That boomer shit wasn’t really making sense.   
And Andrew Left, this fuckface, threw in his towel, citing that he was being targeted by WSB retards and his family was being threatened, with no evidence so far. 

You see, just like most of you retards and autists, I don’t really know about all the technical shit the smart fucks throw around, nor will I ever understand them.  
I ain’t no big brain. I can’t read the charts, I can’t decipher them fancy jargons like “short interest,” “float,” “borrow shares,” and so forth.

But at least I know this: **why the fuck are they trying to scare us away when all we are doing, if they are right, is literally throwing our money at them?** 

This is exactly how they make money, isn’t it? This is the name of their game, isn’t it? 

They do some shorting, hedging, market manipulation, all that, which, me with my big brain who only knows “StOnKs OnLy Go uP,” don’t know much about.  And then they condescendingly shit talk us into oblivion. And they just take our money. This is how it’s done, no? 

But look, without any of their help, we are literally lining up one after another to voluntarily fork over our money.   
Shouldn’t this great for them? Isn’t this what they wanted all along?  
**So why in the fuckity fuck are they trying so fucking hard?** 

That right there alone is a good enough DD for me to hold. That's good enough for me to band with my fellow retards and autist in raising my middle finger to the market makers and tell them to shove it up their nostrils. We are clearly doing something ""wrong,"" so I'm going to continue doing what I'm doing ""wrong."" 

I mean, who the fuck really knows, right?   
GME could reach $690.42 next week, or it could fall back to $4.20.

But I don’t care anymore. 

This is so much more than just tendies.   
And yes, tendies are important and I’ll gladly take them if they come my way.

But this potentially is a historical moment for a new beginning in the market.   
Us retards and autists, equipped with quality shit DDs and endless memes, telling them in big boys pants, nah, fuck off. They used to brush us off, and they still are brushing us off, but now they are slowly realizing we are a force to be reckoned with. 

And that, *that* is why I’m holding.   
That is why I’ll continue to hold until we are declared as victors in this war. 

And so what if we lose, I’ll burn with all of you knowing that we died together fighting.

GME Synthetic Calls,0.91,"To all the folks that were hoping to buy more calls today but couldn't becuase the strikes weren't available, in the future remember you can create synthetic calls until the new chain revs up. You can do this by buying shares in increments of 100 and buying puts at the strike price equivalent to your basis. Also known as a synthetic long call, married put, or protective put.

This was also a cheaper way of buying ATM calls for most today. For example, at $60 you could buy 100 shares and a put for $915 (expiring 1/29). The breakeven is $60 + (915/100) = $69.15. Alternatively, a $60 call option with the same expiry was $1,188, making the breakeven $60 + (1,188/100) = $71.88.

Nice little tool to have in your belt for situations like this. Upside is that you can also sell the shares when they spike and keep the put for afterwards. It'll be near valueless on the spike, but when the equity returns back to Earth after the squeeze it will regain some of it's value. (Obviously will want longer dated puts depending on you view of the timing of the squeeze.)

Hopefully a helpful reminder! And also hopfully convinces some folks to jump in that are nervous about downside from FOMO'ing in too late.

Note: For those who think the puts will hurt the squeeze, the delta hedging from the put will get you to a roughly the same place as that done by just buying a long call (i.e. just buying a call and no underlying shares.) Just like buying calls, it is not as effective as just buying shares outright, but still a net positive to the squeeze. (And as the price increases the delta hedging will also increase untill you are near parity after you're in the money.)

"A message to the community: Be Humble, Be Smart, and Congrats",0.93,"I, like many others, have seen the impressive gains GME has recently brought upon our community. With that in mind, I wanted to congratulate everyone and also send out a message. 

We are a subreddit that has recently broken two million. An impressive feat, but we are among the lucky few. In the light of the many world events occurring within and outside the public arena's eye, we must remember that there are those who have to suffer and slog through their work day just to survive. We may be entering a time of unprecedented opportunity, but with that comes risk. Those of you who have 100k+ club with your gains, I implore you to give back to whatever causes you care for. As the finance community likes to say, we are in the middle of a wealth transfer. Let's not become egotistical assholes and instead use our fortune and knowledge to pay it forward. Money isn't everything once you have it, so once you hit a point you feel comfortable with, try funneling the gains towards a more tangible endeavor (like a business).

To those of you new folks, please do your due diligence and research. While the memes can easily make this seem like a nonconsequential game, this market takes more than it gives (unless you play the smart long game ie. Actual Investing). Plays can easily blow up in your face leaving you with a mere fraction of your original balance or even nothing at all. Just be smart with your autism. People have ended their lives over this shit.

With all that said, my current goal is to break 5k soon, but I hope to join ya'll in the 100k+ club in the near future. Good luck and may the tendies be plentiful!",2021-01-23 02:28:08

And their business is just growing over the years. Recently they have added Vet Services on their shops which will be a huge market catcher. Plus, they do Online delivery within an hour via Third Party Delivery Service named SHIPT. I personally do SHIPT delivery as a part time job besides my Structural Engineering full time job. And I know how busy petco keeps me while I do delivery. Delivery within 20 mins is another market catcher. Over this pandemic period, amount of pets did not decrease, rather increased exponentially.  

So I have my full faith on $WOOF! My target price is $120 in 6 months. Just look at chewy and do your math. Currently they are lower than their recent ipo price and I think this is the best price you can get in on this boat for.

Can we have a talk about exit strategy while still maintaining the 💎✊ ethos?,0.94,"As GME ramps up there's a lot of people old and new who are going to start thinking about exit strategy as they see their accounts grow to numbers they didn't even know existed. Obviously the diamond handing has helped the run up to the squeeze, but I think if we don't start talking about eloquent ways to exit a trade, it could lead to an inverse effect of paper hands as people aren't prepared and will panic out of their position. This is exacerbated by the fact that any attempt at people asking when they're selling is responded to with ""420.69"". I know that the squeeze is going to be super unpredictable and we don't really know how it's going to look when it comes, but surely people must be thinking about how they're going to personally come out on top of this trade, and I think it would help ease tension on newer retards if they understood what the top of a short squeeze might look and feel like on the chart, or just even how to know when it's time to exit a trade from a goal-setting or emotional/psychological perspective. So retards of the world, how are you planning on monitoring this squeeze on your own account? Are you playing it by ear? Are you going to sell off a small number of positions to cover your buy-in cost and then ride until your balls shrivel up into your stomach? How do you convince yourself to exit a trade? Would you rather exit on the way up or the way down? What's your risk tolerance to being a bag holder? These are the questions I'm asking myself now and over the weekend. We can only have diamond hands if everyone's convicted.

Martin Shkreli's Thoughts on GME,0.42,"  Sauce: [https://martinshkreli.com/blog/f/1222021---on-bouncy-castles](https://martinshkreli.com/blog/f/1222021---on-bouncy-castles)

&#x200B;

GME is a funny phenomenon. I wrote a post on r/wsb noting I didn't think the stock was a long and it was removed! Now there's some Stalinesque behavior! In Soviet bubble, all stock must go up! Jokes aside, this $3 billion market cap \[edit: now 6B\] had $300m in cash flow at peak. I don't care that the stock has gone from 4 to 40--I'm interested in where it goes from here. A turnaround (can you call it that? a return to normal...) could bring cash flows to their old peak, but I suspect the continuing demise of retail and other headwinds probably make peak achievable cash flow closer to $200m. So, you're paying 15x for a turnaround/return that hasn't happened yet. That's not outrageously expensive, but it's not for me. Plenty of cheaper stocks out there.

  One more thing--trying to game short-selling--a bit of a metamarket approach--rarely works in my experience. I've seen all kinds of ""squeezes"" like \[CENSORED TICKER\], Volkswagen/Porsche, etc. While there are functional market mechanics that are worth knowing and watching, trying to 'battle' in the marketplace doesn't make sense. Look at HLF, etc. At the end of the day, the value of the company will be what matters, which is generally a function of the cash flow of the company. There are other dynamics, of course, that's what makes a good trader a good trader. I'd rather ignore that stuff and be a decent investor, since I think there is limited causal reasoning in the former. Intuition rules the trader, and we're in a very non-intuitive environment. 

  Anyway, I think GME is more of a long at $20 and more of a short at $60-80. No need to get upset about one's opinion. I have been around Internet message boards on stocks since they began, and geez, people get emotional, way more than r/wsb. I have really ticked people off my entire life on stock message boards (and come to think of it... everywhere else) pointing out the obvious. See some old posts of mine on \[CENSORED TICKER\], CYTX, ONTY, NFLD and many more. All of those stocks disappeared with failure. GME is a real company with valueable assets. It's not a short from what I can tell. But that's just my opinion!",2021-01-23 01:50:28

$GME will go to infinity,0.95,"ok retards heard me out, i believe that we have just recreated tesla's infinite money glitch in $GME with the recent gamma squeeze last week from $20 to $40 and today from $40 to $70.

&#x200B;

if you don't know what a gamma squeeze is yet, you might be actually retarded. but basically when you buy OTM calls, the market makers who sold you those calls will hedge by buying a few shares depending on how OTM the call was (more shares as the call goes more ITM). when the price of the underlying moves up, the market makers will be forced to buy more shares to balance the gamma of the trade.

this creates an infinite loop:

1. underlying price increases
2. more calls get closer to being ITM
3. MM's needing to hedge their short calls by buying more shares
4. underlying price increase
5. shorts get squeezed/margin called
6. more calls get close to becoming ITM
7. MM's hedge more
8. share price reaches infinity 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

apart from just buying OTM calls there are a few conditions necessary for this to work:

* a reason for the share price to increase in the first place to start the infinite money glitch loop
* way more call buyers than put buyers
* a good amount of shorts sellers

&#x200B;

it is clear that $GME fulfils all of those conditions:

* ryan cohen has a few bombshells to drop and anyone of those could send the share price to the moon
   * build-a-pc kiosks
   * tweeting a 🚀
   * gme roadmap
   * increasing his stake in the company
   * probably a lot more you can find in other DDs
* WSB has now >2m degenerates, our $GME posts can be found on r/all, r/stocks, r/investing, yahoo conversations, stocktwits, youtube, tiktok, heck we have so many boomers and fomo autists recently joining in for the squeeze, this stonk might even be more hyped than tesla.
* we do not just have a good amount short interest, we have a ONCE IN A LIFETIME WALLSTREET RECORD of 130%+ short interest and it is very unlikely or even impossible that they have all covered today (look up some of the float DDs).

TLDR:

* buying calls are as useful as buying shares

GME is going into triple digits next week sell at your own risk,0.97,"I’m seeing people sell their shares for very happy reasons and I know it means a lot to you guys, after all we can’t all be DFV because he’s a legend. 

But next week it’s EASILY going past $100 and even if you feel like this is your first “big win” as a new trader, you’re not alone and there are thousands of people profiting off this with you. 

That being said, it’s time to have a diamond grip on the 🍋 and get all the fucking juice we can. Make that big first trade something to REALLY brag about or turn those shares you’ve piled up into some serious equity! See you Monday bright and early retards 💎🙌🏻

EDIT: Things to note for all the comments asking the same questions:
1.) can I still buy in? 
     Yes, buy as many shares or calls as you want but for for devilssake don’t put your grocery money, rent money, or bail money on this shit. Only what you can afford to loose. At the end of the day, don’t end up becoming like the thing we swore to destroy

2.) shares or calls? 
     Shares are the driving force of this surge. Safer in the long run even if you buy at whatever “top” you think it’s at because if it goes down a couple bucks and you succumb to paper hands then you’re not out the money like you be in calls. 
     Calls are a way to make money or loose money in ludicrous speed as well, but keep in mind non of this would be possible without shares and in the end it’ll still be shares that stand the strongest. Only my OPINION. 

3.) who is u/Deepfuckingvalue ? 
     Simple: THE FUCKING MAN, that’s who. So stfu and thank him in your weekend-closed prayers. 

4.) what are my positions? 
     I won’t post mine because I’m in a pickle with the whole “don’t tell your family how much you make” conundrum, and thanks to this post I think I just doxxed myself... so let’s just say I’m in the “retarded” position. 

5.) what’s the top? 
     The top is when you’ve had enough. When you can’t take the pressure of the “gamble”. When you look at yourself in the mirror and say “not today paper hands” or when it all comes crashing down to 0 after the peak at $420.69 (EDIT or at 1,000,000 fuckers it was a joke duh) All I can say is get out when you’re ready to not have FOMO in either direction it goes thereafter. 

6.) Lastly, why are you reading this shit? 
     Because you’re regarded. I am retarded, and I don’t deserve a podium anymore then any of you. Take your gold back and your silver back and spend it on GME shares, please. 🚀🚀🚀",2021-01-23 01:20:37

PSA: GME Earnings March 25 - Here's how we send GME to Mars,0.96,"Guys, girls, degens in any form,

GME has earnings coming up in a few months and we still have time to BOOST the shit out of this thing. The quarter officially closes Jan 31. This means we have until the end of the month to pump GME's sales and membership counts.

&#x200B;

**Here's the action plan-**

**Step 1 - Download the App and upgrade to a Powerup Rewards Pro membership**

* Increased Membership counts and App downloads/ratings demonstrate that GME is picking up candidates for reoccurring sales which is very attractive from an investor's POV

&#x200B;

**Step 2 - Buy something, fucking anything\***

* **Video Games**
* **Consoles**
* **Accessories** (Headsets, Controllers, Peripherals)
* **Electronics** (Cell Phones, Tablets, Smart Watches, Speakers, TVS & Monitors, Drones, [HOVERBOARDS](https://www.gamestop.com/electronics-hoverboards))
* **Toys & Collectibles**
* **Games & Puzzles** (Card games, Trading cards, Board games)
* **Clothing** (Tshirts, Hats, Costumes, Backpacks, Laptop Bags)

Buy it for yourself, your friend, your wife's boyfriend, my mom.

Ima buy my GF a Nintendo Switch with these fucking tendies that have been graced upon me

&#x200B;

\*Note #1: If you pre-order a product or buy GME gift cards before Jan 31 they will be counted as a liability (debt) until the product is shipped or gift card redeemed. Any pre-order can be assumed to be a debt for this Quarter if the order is placed before Jan 31. If you buy a gift card and don't redeem it before Jan 31 it will count **against** GME for this quarter. Ultimately, pre-orders are good for business and so are gift card sales, as long as they are eventually redeemed.

Note #2: Try to use the App for your purchases. **Take notes on anything frustrating about the user experience while you are making the purchases.** I've already noted a bunch of Feedback that would be easy for them to change.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Step 3 - PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON THE APP**

[The feedback section on the App can be found by navigating to \\""Profile \> \(scroll all the way down\) \> About\/Feedback \> Send Feedback \> App Review\\""](https://preview.redd.it/9ys1scicn1d61.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d54db70c8cdb4d44a70196e820367ea596122d5)

* Submit any feedback from the notes you took while making your purchases
* What the fuck is better than thousands of degenerates Quality Assurance testing the GameStop App and filing bugs? It takes a huge workload off internal GME resources and we, as the users, are in the best position to provide meaningful suggestions.
* Rate the App 5 stars if you are feeling inclined

**Example feedback:** I found that I'm not able to use my regular password due to special character limitations. This limitation would have an effect on a user that relies on a Password Vault auto-generated password.

# 

# TLDR: Here's the point... we can stop buying many products from other companies entirely- and try to leverage GameStop as our one-stop-shop as much as possible. We have until end of January for one last push to make upcoming Earnings an interstellar journey 🚀🚀🚀🥜🥜🥜

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Positions:** Fidelity Regular - 110 Shares, Fidelity IRA - 700 shares, Robinhood - 450 shares

BTW, I confirmed with Fidelity today that ""Share Lending"" is NOT enabled by default on the brokerage. You have to sign a bunch of documents to grant those fuckers the ability to lend out your shares to the 🌈🐻s

&#x200B;

**Final thoughts:** PEANUT GANG, RISE UP!!! 🥜🥜🥜

If you have any other good strategies to help bolster GME's upcoming earnings, let me know and I'll add it.

* Amerikunts buy from **GameStop**
* Maple Syrup Guys buy from **EB Games** / **ZING** **~~My Girlfriend~~**

🚀🚀RIG🚀🚀 - My pick for a YOLO play,0.6,"Thanks to  [12xLevered](https://www.reddit.com/user/12xLevered/) !

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2ukim/transocean\_rig/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2ukim/transocean_rig/)

# LISTEN UP 🚀R🚀E🚀T🚀A🚀R🚀D🚀S🚀

I saw RIG mentioned earlier and did a little bit of digging; Transocean LTD itself is in a financial hole and may face bankruptcy in a few  years, but that's completely irrelevant. Aside from the fact I think  they'll recover, **this is not a fundamentals play**.  If that entertainment company with a banned ticker has been able to go up 80% over the past week with their books,  it's a clear indicator that we live in a clown world and **speculation is the only true market mover.**

🚀🚀🚀🚀

This  is a speculative play, as I think oil has the potential to rip up short  term - I believe that COVID is essentially behind us at this point, and  even if that's not true, people are going to be thinking that, and **oil remains in my eyes the best recovery play at this point in time**.  There's still a lot of room to grow, and new government policy is only  going to make it more appealing - although it's beaten down some crude  stocks, **oil remains a necessity and an immensely profitable one at that**.  So, people are going to want to start getting into oil stocks ASAP as  soon as they realise the economy is back on, and they're going to want  to pick shares up while they're still cheap after the recent dip. I also  think that there's going to be a pivot into commodities very soon, and  anyone trying to avoid getting gaped by a tech crash - I think a total  market crash is unlikely due to inflation - will likely park their money  there.

🚀🚀🚀🚀

So why RIG? **The option chain is fucking wonderful.**  Nothing but cheapies, month by month. There's some fantastic FDs, solid  monthlies, and LEAPS might even be a worthwhile play if you want to  guarantee a return on your investment greater than -100%.

**There's also a great deal of short interest.**  You know how that goes by now. I'm not going to go around calling  everything a short squeeze, but I'm sure everyone saw how the market  reacted today. **Shorts are TERRIFIED right now.** So, if this happens to become a solid play, **if short interest gets a whiff of WSB aping into another meme, they're going to cover ASAP** to avoid the fiascos surrounding GME, BB and BBBY. And the price goes up, accordingly.

Technically,  today seemed like a good place to get in, and this may remain the case  on Monday - it's held flat after a drop from recent highs, and even  gained slightly today, and **I fully expect it to retrace over the next week** \- potentially it even breaks higher, so long as there are a few good days of high oil prices.

🚀🚀🚀🚀

**I'm personally playing this short term, so I wouldn't get in if RIG opens up 20-30% on Monday, which is entirely possible.** Buy in if it doesn't. I plan to get out by end of next week, unless it dips or crabs for the entire week. **I  picked calls slightly out so I have the potential to play earnings if  it remains flat until then, and hopefully get out at break even.** It may even continue to run, who knows.

Let's make some money, here or elsewhere. Love you all!

$CRSR - Short Squeeze - Defend WSB,0.72,"What's up autists! In typical hedge fund fashion, we are gearing up for another generational wealth transfer like $GME, $BBBY, and $AMC. Gear up for $CRSR - it's just about to begin! I've seen a few other posts on this topic, and I think we can squeeze CRSR in true WSB fashion. 

I've included some basic information for those who haven't done research into $CRSR. 

**Fundamentals**: 

* $3.5B in market cap 
* Q4 earnings expected to be $512m ($478m for low, $522m for high), announced on Feb 10
* Extremely strong fundamentals - 25% gross margin, $36m in profit in Q3, $100m+ cash to $400m debt 
* Corsair has a unique float given their recent IPO and large institutional ownership that's locked up until March 21: 
   * Total Shares - 91.2m
   * Float -17.62m (7.5m recently diluted from the total share count by allowing insiders to sell before lockup) 
   * Short Float - 5.66m (or **31.5% of the float**) 

**Thesis**: 

Corsair recently IPO'ed, and have nearly 80% of their shares locked up until March 21. Despite the small float, shorts have flocked to the stock, and have increased their short position to 31.5% of the float. 

CRSR has cooled off since its initial IPO, and has been posting higher lows. CRSR appears to be in a descending wedge that'll pop on Feb 3, sending it into an upward channel. It's quite a beautiful setup. 

&#x200B;

[15m Chart](https://preview.redd.it/09twad7q4zc61.png?width=2468&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a5fcdc5033a681de5c3c2b188f235726cf0270c)

Catalysts for the upward breakout: 

* Logitech (direct competitor) recently posted an earnings beat, with revenues growing 73% - Corsair is expected to follow suite
* 98.7% of total shares are institution/insider owned
   * Institutional ownership of CRSR is 94.5% - 91.6% is US institutions and 2.9% is European institutions
   * Insider ownership is 4.2%
   * Remaining 1.3% equates to about 1.2m shares
* Large WSB interest - let's get it going. More posts/more comments on CRSR. 

**Play**: 

* Buy shares 
* Buy calls for Feb
* Sell puts for Feb

**Positions**: 

Currently none - I started doing this research after market close today. Corsair has long been on my watch list as I used to work with them prior to their IPO - solid company and solid products. 

I plan to add 500 shares at market open on Monday as well as some 45c for Feb earnings.",2021-01-23 00:11:59
VW short squeeze was 5x. Can GME be 25x at $1000? 🤔,0.93,"Seen a lot of comments saying GME is gonna hit $1000 and using the VW 2008 short squeeze as an example.

VW’s share price in the months leading up to the squeeze was around €200. This of course mooned to $1000 resulting in a 5x return at the peak (if you sold).

I’ve seen people say GME will hit north of $1k (I hope it does btw 👐💎). The reason for this it’s supposedly because it’s more heavily shorted than VW, thus explaining the $1000 estimate. Anyone more mathematically inclined want to chip in here?",2021-01-23 00:11:33

Why WSB will never hear from the SEC over the GuhMemeStahp,0.97,"TLDR: Early but not wrong, call me Michael-misseditbythatmuch-Burry

Been hawking Gamestop for a long fucking time, knew the squeeze was eventual but something something irrational something solvent.

Heres why the SEC will never bother us over GME.

SEC would first have to investigate how more than the outstanding amount of shares were able to be shorted, and the options manipulation that took place from Jul 2019 - Aug 2020

Shorts would use their uPnL on their positions to sell puts and intentionally drive prices up by covering, only to stop just short of important strikes, where they would have ominously placed sell orders ( additional shorts ), they bought back their put positions for pennies, which they would then turn around and use to further pressure the price of GME.

Back then the books were so thin a 100k buy order would net 7-10% gain in price

\*buys back puts\*

\*slam the same 100k into a sell order\*

price right back where it started, use profit to drive the price down further - it was fucking disgusting. Even tho my [$5/$6/$7Cs expired in July 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h89gvx/gme_gang_still_ridin_the_dd/), nothing makes me happier than knowing these people got BTFO

They put 15k GameStop employees out of work - all by pure manipulation that went unchecked for over a year. SEC would have to look right in the fuckin mirror to see whos responsible for this. Dont be mad that retail made a couple bucks, just do your job, k bb?

&#x200B;

After market close, my dad walked up to me and asked to see my GME shares. I showed him my portfolio, and he asked, ""Are you also a part of the reddit army?""

GME🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Some context: my dad has been investing for 30 years: he is the type of person whose balls tingle when he gets a $1 dollar dividend and when his portfolio goes up 7% in a year. And today, he asked me about GME and the ""reddit army"".

PLTR🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

If my boomer dad knows what's going on with GME and shittron, then we know we're in trouble: even the most traditional investors know about r/wallstreetbets now. This is not a good thing.

GME🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Throughout the past couple of days and especially in the past couple of hours, I have seen my wsb feed become filled with posts showing screenshots of this sub being mentioned in countless news articles, treating this as if it were a great accomplishment. We are all over the news, but all this publicity is a bad thing for our community.

PLTR🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

The wsb twitter and the shittron research fiasco has not helped us: they help the media portray us as one voice and as an institution, when in reality we are many voices that are just looking to make some tendies. As you can see by my conversation with my dad, the public sees r/wallstreetbets as an institution. We need to stop any more acts like these that will cause us to get more publicity: this could get the SEC involved and have our community taken down and investigated for market manipulation. As u/Engine3er said, ""We don't need SEC to do us what your wife's boyfriend does to your wife.""

GME🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I do not want to see this community taken down: I have been here for a while now, and now primarily use reddit just for this sub. This sub is the only sub that I view(the other word is a banned ticker symbol) by new - although that may have to change since it is becoming filled with so much garbage and low effort posts from new members. You guys have become like a family to me. So we need to stop all this stupid shit and go back to just being a couple of autists trying to reach the moon.

PLTR🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Because of the influx of new people thanks to our publicity we need more mods. There are almost 2 million retards in this sub, and most of those retards are newly discovered. Despite the size of this sub, there are only 19 mods? We need more mods so I can view by new without having to scroll through a bunch of shitty posts that contribute nothing to this sub until I find a well-thought-out dd or meme. I would love to be a mod, but I've never done that before and have no idea how to even apply.

GME🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Sorry for the big ass blocks of texts and poor formatting, it must have hurt your smooth brains.  
These are just my thoughts regarding the quandary surrounding r/wallstreetbets, but I'm just a 15 year old autist who has only two stocks in his portfolio. Please address any mistakes I made in the comments, I was kinda ranting about this and didn't do any proper research other than listening to what my wife's boyfriend had to say about this. Please comment your thoughts on this so the fucktards who go straight to the comments know what's going on.

PLTR🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Thanks for coming to my ted talk.

GME🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

tl;dr:

* publicity is bad, stop doing stupid shit that will land us on the newspapers
* we need more mods
* stop making low effort posts
* stop treating the mess between Melvin and Shittron as if it was a war
* GME 🚀🚀🚀🌕
* PLTR🚀🚀🚀🌕

"Calls on Nigerian Scam Jumia - PART 2, Who's buying???, Retail traders, and GME S&P 500 index inclusion",0.85,"🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

[This is a continuation of my first post on JUMIA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/knquvb/calls_on_nigerian_scam_jumia_90k_buy_in/)

&#x200B;

JUMIA has performed better than I ever expected and I'm completely out. Anyone with calls went 3X to 10X the past month. I really have no idea why its ripped today. Probably the Universe fucking Andrew Left again. I really have no clue who's been buying, there's is a lot more eyes on here than ever before. JMIA will likely continue its trend up until earnings. The stock is incredibly volatile so anyone trading it needs to be cautious. Either way I took advantage of todays gains and have pivoted all of my proceeds into GME.

Why do you ask? Why did I buy the ""top""? Well I've been here (on WSB) for a very long time, like before the 3X ETF craze, the Baltic shipping craze, Biotech craze, the shutdowns, etc. Like I'm talking back when we used to have annual meetups. This is one of the first times I've seen trading ideas by retail investors have such a profound effect on the market. Don't get me wrong trading induced short squeezes happen all the time but typically its on lower cap, lower float stocks. Larger cap squeezes are typically the actions of significantly larger funds.

But what's happening here is even bigger than WSB. This is one of the few rare moments where retail is in control. Not bots, not insiders, not hedge funds, or institutions. Just retail fucking over those that have fucked over retail traders ever since 1790, and I'm all here for it.

SO FOR IT THAT IM HOLDING UNTIL GME IS RE-ENTERED INTO THE SP500

For those that dont know it was added in 2007 but was eventually removed in 2016. Right now its marketcap is sitting at $5B which is about half of the $10B inclusion criteria. When QS crashed from $75 to $50, it bounced to over $130.  If GME reaches those levels and continue their quarterly earning trend, it will start the discussions of both SP500 inclusion and Russell 1000 inclusion

A hedge fund managers perspective on GME,0.97,"I am a hedge fund manager (long-short, derivative mixed equity fund primarily value focused with some growth). In the past we have been value holders of GME three other times and started a small position today nears it's intraday high and will likely add to this next week should the stock fall.   Previously all my Reddit comments have involved my e-Skate collection or my landing of my airplane in challenging conditions (see: [https://youtu.be/Rn7XoYKlZl0](https://youtu.be/Rn7XoYKlZl0)) However, I can't resist commenting on the fascinating technical factors that likely will continue to propel this issue higher - perhaps significantly so over the next few weeks.  Andrew Left's mocking derision of retail investors may prove to be his waterloo.  Why would a value focused fund manager buy a stock that based on classic fundamental value analysis appears significantly overvalued?  

GME appears to be a very interesting example of individual stock reflexivity.  What is reflexivity you ask?  This is the theory, originally promoted by George Soros that the stock market itself can cause the economy to either rise of fall (as opposed to the classic teaching that the economy affects the stock market).  An example of market reflexivity would be the great depression whereby a crashed market brought down an economy that was only in an ordinary recession, or the recent improvement in the economy, not withstanding Covid, which has followed a rising market.  In GME's case the rise in the stock price itself will likely result in fundamental improvements to the underlying economic metrics of the company.  Why?

1. As the price of the stock rises, GME finds itself in the enviable position where it can use it's stock at currency to buy complementary businesses it could not otherwise afford - monetization of the current short squeeze by the enterprise will lead to fundamentally higher revenue and profits of the enterprise should they find good strategic acquisitions to further monetize their large retail customer base (which has real and to date largely untapped value).  The company is likely right now on the hunt for a major acquisition that could fundamentally alter the companies future prospects with that acquisition largely paid for on the back of short seller covering.
2. Monetization of the short covering increase in share price via issue of a secondary .   The $500 million in debt (net of cash) the company currently has could be entirely extinguished with a secondary that is dilutive of only 10% of the equity base.  In fact such a secondary will, despite this dilution, likely result in a significant price rise for the stock (versus the usual fall in price after most, but not all, secondaries).  Bankruptcy risk will largely be eliminated with this secondary as will interest rate risk and financing costs ultimately increasing cash flow per share.  A 20% secondary will leave the company in a strong cash positive position with this cash available for expansion of sales efforts, cloud offerings, acquisitions, etc.
3. Directly increased sales and revenue by virtue of the large amount of attention this epic short squeeze has brought to the company.  I suspect most long retail stockholders have explored the companies web offerings and are considering becoming customers.  This is free advertising to people with money who are tech savvy and the exact demographic GME would target with paid advertising.  
4. Retention and efforts of existing management now becomes easy.  Every manager there wants to see this continue.  Operations at companies with sinking share prices typically suffer as management and employees leave the enterprise or develop anger and lassitude (think Sears Holdings).   The opposite is occurring here with every manager trying to beat their numbers to see the squeeze continue.
5. This issue remains extremely heavily shorted.  Despite the squeeze that has already occurred, other ""value"" based investors have dived into short positions as the price has risen.  The short positions of this issue appears (although I can't be certain) to exceed 100% with all available shares already lent out from marginal accounts and probably a lot of naked shorting going on as well.  Although I don't yet have the current data on todays short position, I can say for certain the stock remains very heavily shorter, perhaps more so now than at any previous time.  Today, I called my broker asking about the availability of shares to short and the borrow costs.  We have one of the larger accounts at our brokers firm and I was able to speak directly to the ""hard to borrow"" desk.  No borrowable shares are available at any broker, anywhere, at this time, even for high borrow costs or even from other brokers.  This extreme short against a small common float, made more extreme no-doubt by naked shorting, could end very poorly for those short this issue.  As they are forced to close out their positions, the stock will continue to rise and continue to exacerbate the positive effects the rising price has on the above 4 issues.

Impossible to know really where the stock goes from here as there does currently exist a disconnect from fundamentals. However, the extreme short position against the unrestricted common float here suggests to me there is a much greater chance of GME's price continuing to increase, perhaps significantly so, and this chance is far greater than the now fearful pundit in hiding's proclamation that the stock would soon see $20.

For what it's worth, over the past 13 years of this funds life, we have significantly beaten both the overall market and the dow,  (12.2%/year margin over DJIA inclusive of dividends since 2008).  We  have had plenty of losing issues despite this beat but also way more big winners, some really big.  Right now my money's with the retail investors who are long GME.  We only have a small position here but this may prove a big winner for us also.  Cheers.",2021-01-22 23:09:53

Here's the fun part - while I never thought I'd make this much on the trade, when I entered it I promised my Maker I'd give 20% of whatever gains I had to charity and folks affected by the pandemic. I thought maybe it would be $10k or maybe $20k - who knows, $50k if shit got wild. 

So far, post taxes it's around $150k. Wow. We researched charities in our area and I found one that focuses on preventing evictions and helping kids in crisis. We called them this week to tell them what we plan to drop by next week and they were shocked. It costs a lot less to keep a family in their current home than to find them a new one, and in a lot of places, the average eviction is over less than a thousand bucks. They estimate this will keep 100 families in their homes - the majority of whom have kids under 5.

🐻 take on $BB from an automotive employee nobody,0.48,"#I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING PROCEED WITH CAUTION 

According to this sub there are three things going for $BB that cause it to be undervalued:

- Cylance Acquisition 

- Blackberry IVY partnership with AWS

- QNX 

## Cylance: I'll start with the one I don't know shit about 

This is a crowded space (anti virus). That's all I have to say about that.

## Blackberry IVY partnership with AWS:

AWS is fighting hard to get market share in the edge computing space. Perfect example of this is AWS Greengrass and IoT core.

What is [AWS Greengrass](https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/)? It's IoT device management. AWS is going to do the device lifecycle management for QNX deployments on vehicles. (speculation) Essentially, this looks to be AWS Greengrass integrated with BB QNX.  

Why does AWS want to partner with BB QNX? Well to me, this looks to be a classic extend embrace extinguish play by Amazon. AWS has products such as IoT core that can manage telematics flow between OEMs and vehicles, what they don't have is products for in vehicle development. Once they understand the market, they will introduce AWS products along side IoT core to replace QNX piece by piece in the vehicles. 

## QNX

Ok WSB. Y'all keep saying that QNX will take $BB to the moon because all these upstart EV nobodies are using QNX to bootstrap their infotainment systems. 

Enter automotive linux: https://www.automotivelinux.org/

Automotive linux is a partnership with a TON of traditional OEMS to build an open source software (linux) stack for vehicles such as infotainment, edge compute and telematics. 

This is effectively the nail in the coffin (IMO) for QNX. If these EV upstarts gain marketshare, they have no reason to continue paying $BB for a closed source, price-y QNX. They'll migrate to automotive linux for F R E E. No more niche QNX developers, get a generic dev with some linux info and they'll be up to speed in no time. 

If QNX dies, so does the IVY partnership. In fact, since AGL linux based and open source, no doubt Amazon will make amazing AWS client libraries to integrate with Greengrass, IoT Core, etc. Once Amazon gets its fingers into AGL, IVY is dead in the water.


So where does this leave us? Cylance. In my know nothing option $BB's only asset is Cylance in a highly competitive space. Once virus protection entities get big enough, hackers start developing FUD (fully undetectable) solutions to the most popular virus protection software. Back in their day you think McAfee or Norton was shit? No. They became popular and had hackers develop against their software.

GME Still has room to grow IF...,0.92,"We all saw the squeeze. I know all your wife's boyfriends are getting jealous at your new lambo. Enjoy.

There's a reason we stopped where we did. You're not going to like it. GME had the potential to reach fucking Alpha Centauri but there was one important thing making it hard.

Strikes.

The highest strike available to you retards was $60. At this point, no one is selling calls for anything above that because there IS nothing above that. WSB inadvertently did what was called a ""Gamma squeeze"" where basically MMs need to buy the underlying stock for every call contract they sell. You guys bought SO MANY FUCKING CALLS that the MMs had to cover their positions. They don't want to do this, but they had to.

But the calls stopped at 60. That's also roughly where the whole thing stopped. Yes, it went to 72. That was probably people continuing to buy shares but more than likely it was margin calls getting activated for a FEW short sellers. Others may come later. Some other short sellers may have closed themselves out earlier and newer, fresher meat came in (at new higher short prices.) The point is you see where it basically hovered once the day was done. Roughly $60. That's all it could do. 

But the gamma squeeze is what ended up happening here possibly in conjunction with a small short squeeze.

So how does it go up from here?

If whomever decides what options are available to buy adds more to the list, be it MMs, Options Clearing Corp, whomever does that shit. 70c, 80c, 100c, 150c. If they add more, and you people keep buying those moronicly stupid OTM contracts that we all know will make you rich, that's how you squeeze everyone.

This is also why BB shot up when GME was shut down. You guys IMMEDIATELY went in and bought EVERY damn call contract there was.

Buying 50k shares of GME will cost you a cool 3mil right now.

But you can make the MMs buy 50k shares and spend their 3mil by spending $100,000 on those 80c 1/29 contracts... If they show up on Monday.

If anything I said was wrong and you absolutely know better, please correct me. I'm asking nicely so be nice about it. We're all here to learn, despite us being retards that only say ""strike date!!!1!11""

TL;DR: This was mostly a gamma squeeze. When you buy a contract from an MM you are forcing them to buy 100 shares of the underlying. When you do this with thousand of contracts across higher strikes you are forcing them to buy more and more. This is called a gamma squeeze. This is what you guys did the first squeeze (20 -> 35) and most of what you guys did for this squeeze. If more strike prices get added, it will blast off even further.

Adjusting TL;DR with this tidbit by u/FatCatBoomerBanker:
So, to fix your TL;DR, they don't have to buy the full 100 shares to remain delta neutral. Everyday Joes like you and me have to, but MM will only buy shares based on the delta value of the option and adjust as it ebbs and flows.

Final edit: read u/Unlucky-Prize comment below. It goes into further detail. 

Edit to add:

I'm hoping they add higher strikes for next week. If they do, this thing hits Andromeda.

Price and Number of shorted shares - correlation vs causation 🤓 ft. PLTR,0.89,"There is case made for prices not just reflecting simple buy and sell but also the amount of of available short shares to a greater extent. I'll take PLTR as an example, you look at PLTR when the price is low you can almost guarantee that the number of shares available are very little.

On **Jan 6th** the number of shares available for that day reached it's lowest and that's when the momentum swung back leading to the increasing trend seen below. On **December 15th** we also reach the lowest number of shares available and once again the momentum swings back.

Possibly because after reaching their lowest point you can't keep shorting so people start covering. Now this doesn't always happen but I can see a pattern that when there is a downturn and there are no available shares left, the direction of the trend reverses.

&#x200B;

[Points where shares available were lowest](https://preview.redd.it/f4wfn7lhkyc61.png?width=1115&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7aa29b08a026a1f979046f7cfc8e7d64901781d)

Just in **January 20th** PLTR shares available were around 200,000 and now it's at 1,000,000 and the price is starting to increase once more from the huge dip.

[Shares available were lowest before we see the huge rebound we saw today](https://preview.redd.it/0c395n68txc61.png?width=329&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa509c5a044839422db4fb41155868e120a3846b)

Now this doesn't always happen because on December 24th the price actually decreases to it's lowest. A possible explanation for the reversal is that a stock can't be shorted forever and when it reaches near it's maximum they start getting unwound. Also, it could just be a counfounding factor as short sellers know more about short interest than we do just like some shortseller said.

Now another reason that I can put some support to this theory is that in **October** when PLTR was trading at $9.00 the number of shares availalbe to be burrowed dropped from 6.7 million to 200k Probably even lower because you can't even see this on the graph.

&#x200B;

[When trading at $9 in october shares available dropped from 6.7 million to 200k](https://preview.redd.it/38zid15dsxc61.png?width=241&format=png&auto=webp&s=c77f35343a1af3c2dce3c27b3f3caf4964157126)

Another ticker is SPWR the number of shares available to burrow was very low and the price has been increasing astronomically with the new government giving lots of support to green energy.

Going back to GME - this was when citron tweeted about the 5 reasons and the shares available plummeted. Now it's near 0.

I think that PLTR is a heavily shorted stock that has a possibility of a squeeze.

Why GME’s closing today is a sign that it will spike even more next week,0.98,"Listen up retards. Emerging addict here. Let me tell you why I think today’s closing price is a sign that GME is yet to rocket!

Why do you think the spike dropped to $60 and stayed there the rest of the day? Because the fuckton of $60 option calls that just expired. /u/PlayFree_Bird explained it well [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2txra/that_was_a_margin_call/gk87z17/). Today wasn’t a margin call, it was a gamma squeeze. The four-hour war at $60 is huge evidence of this. Basically, as the stock price increased, call writers realized they might have to provide stocks for the $60c option owners. Greedy bastards didn’t want to payout. What do they likely do instead? Fucking borrow more GME and short-sell the shit out of it to drop it below $60 and keep it there the rest of the day. If they succeed, they don’t have to provide shit on the butt-ton of 1/22 $60c options. If it closes above $60, they get fucked. For four hours today, every time the stock jumped above $60, call writers bought MORE SHORTS to drop the price back under $60.

Again, today wasn’t MM dumping shorts, it was options contracts buying MORE shorts attempting to save their ass (at least that's what my dumb ass thinks). But guess what? The stock closed at $64.75! Fuck! They lost!

So **why does this mean GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 in the future**?

1) This wasn’t the short squeeze, old shorts are likely still there bleeding fuck and filling the rocket with fuel.

2) Short holdings probably INCREASED today because the gamma squeeze above. More rocket fuel.

3) They lost the fucking bet on number 2, and have to fulfill the calls that expired today. More rocket pressure.

Notice: Aftermarket is up to $68. No more panic-pressure to keep it down.

It seems to me that GME is actually in a better position to rocket AFTER today, not worse. To the moon you retards! 🚀🌚

Probably next week the big squeeze will happen and we will crush a big handful of crooks, robbing the 0.1% of a few billion dollars. What next?

Do you think they are simply gonna roll over and let us enjoy or gains? 

What I think they will instead do is: 

1) hire people to look through the subreddit and find posts hyping certain stocks, and then as we start buying they would short them. We saw similar tactics being used on GME and the reason we broke through is sheer autistic🚀 numbers and a solid strategy, this won’t work on individual calls.

2) create false hype around sinking stocks, maybe even a few heavily doctored DD, this will definetly trick newbies like me and only TA esperts might be able to call Bs on it, but they might be downvoted by Bot armies and disappear in an ocean of comments.

3) scare their other billionaires friends that the peasants are coming for their tendies and to steal their influence, rich people clubs are exclusive for a reason they don’t want us there. I’m not sure what they could do, but rich people weild way more influence that a sub reddit, SEC calls are just one of many ways they could trip us. There might be even be new regulations on trading, this would hurt them too, but as long as we stay out of reach it would be be a good trade off.

4) various: call bs on perfectly good DD, spamming restricted content to have the subreddit quarantined etc.

5) (edited) might use our newfound influence to cause bump and dumps.

Possible solutions:

Well, fuck me if i know, I thought of making the subreddit private, but with 2 million users we would sooner earn a million working on a min wage that find all leaks and infiltrators. Same problem would apply with moving to another subreddit or even an external website.

I think all we can realistically do to resist the storm is: 

remain low-profile outside the platform, if we remain quiet it will be harder to call a crusade on our asses.

avoid giant rally posts that make our already lacking IQ go further down until 🚀 is the only thing we understand.

Actually confirm the DD is legit by doing your own research.

And most importantly, don’t fucking throw all the money you got back in the market, enjoy it a little, we don’t want these old mummies to get it all back at the same time, right?

GME Short Squeeze vs Today's volume,0.95,"I'm hoping someone can explain this to me - I'm still long GME but one of the legit pieces of DD and one of the risks to the short squeeze was that the shorts might liquidate their positions somewhat slowly, right? 

Is it possible that a significant number of short sellers covered today? We had some insane spikes where the SP was climbing more than a dollar per minute, in addition to a floor of basically $55, but more importantly, we saw 190M+ shares trade hands. That's what, nearly 3x the float? 

Is it possible for some of the shorts to have closed their positions? Do we have any accurate data suggesting that perhaps they added to or shrunk their positions?",2021-01-22 21:44:12

GME MOASS Update: ORTEX Data (1/22/21),0.98,"Hi all, it's your friendly neighborhood fellow retard, u/fieryskyes.

Looking to open up a discussion thread about today's GME Short Data. I'm attaching an image from ORTEX after today's beautiful share price action. You bet that GME will be making news rounds all over the world after today, over the weekend. We're only getting started. If any of you have read my MOASS price target post from around a week or so ago\*\*, you would know that I kept on hammering the term 'zero point' over and over. It just means it's the starting point (whether it's your portfolio value, or the share price, or both) prior to a face-ripping MOASS. Well, if you've held on to GME the entire time since that post, congratulations. Your zero point has just grown a substantial amount, **especially** after today's close @ +51.08% (as per Yahoo! Finance GME closing price). GME today even touched \~+-80% intra-day @ $76.76, breaking the previous Share Price ALL-TIME-HIGH of $63.77 (dated Dec. 7, 2008) from ***\~13 years ago*** (data gathered using TD-ToS trading platform), *and then, closing at the new share price ALL-TIME-HIGH closing price @* $65.01 (as per Y! Finance GME). It's some fucking tendie-town shit.

All the mathematical power and beauty of consecutive-day compounding interest is now to GME LONGS' advantage. The inverse is true for shorts: they're getting seriously fucked by many things; face-ripping, ass-gaping, wife-fucking compounding interest only one among them. (Also, RIP to Citron Research AKA. Andrew ""Left for Dead"" Shitron.) Yeah, you read that shit right: SHORTS are about to get inflicted with MAXIMUM MATHEMATICAL PAIN. It sounds nerdy af I know, but ain't that the truth.

I don't claim to be an expert on GME short metrics & data, and so I leave it to the experts to hopefully analyze what I'm attaching here, hence a discussion thread. *AKA. WHAT DO THESE CRAYONS ON THE SCREEN MEAN, DADDY?*

However: based off off what I see on the data attached, I have come to believe that shorts have started to unwind their positions, albeit ***only slightly***, relative to the entire short position. (I could be wrong, and if so, let me know in the comments. Let's discuss.) Still, as the data presents below, it seems that the SHARES SHORTED still stands at a HISTORIC >100%, at 102.29%. *Goddamn. My asscheeks just clenched a little writing and thinking about all the trapped shorts (RIP). What an absolutely titanic and colossal failure of risk management.* Can't complain though lmao. *Tendies all day, everyday, bitch!*

Again remember, on WSB, we take into account TRADEABLE % of FLOAT, where, according to some DDs posted in the sub, is estimated to be running at around 200%+, due to (we, at the very least, assume) '*fixed'* massive institutional and insider ownership, that cannot/will not/*might not* sell, *all while* the shorts are fucking drowning and thrashing around, desperate to get some breathable air--in the middle of the goddamn *Atlantic Ocean* with no boats nor ships in sight. It's like *Titanic*, but they're Jack, and you're *the sexy-ass rich bitch* named Rose. Only one survives. *(Spoiler alert: It ain't Jack.)*

All said, I think we have a ways to go before all the shorts are fully covered (*we're talking potential MULTIPLES of current price, and, ergo, your DADDY-AS-FUCK GME PORTFOLIO)* e.g. more tendies to come. Focus, get ready, and have a plan. This could be *THE* trade of your lifetime.

[CRAYONS TO TENDIE-TOWN, BITCH. \/ You like that, daddy? The image attached is in FULL 4K RESOLUTION. It's some RICH-PEOPLE SHIT.

edit 4: added an important comment, thanks to u/otto989.

>u/otto989: *Hold up it says Thursday, Jan 21 at the bottom right of the chart. I'm as curious as all of you about SI after today but want to make sure these numbers are right.*  
>  
>u/fieryskyes: *Hey man, good catch! Actually, the numbers CHANGED while posting this entire thing, RIGHT AFTER today's close. I literally had to re-type the data. The graph, I will agree, however shows Thursday 21st. Not sure what to make of that exactly. We will keep updating on this for sure. But from what I remember, the ""%FREEFLOAT ON LOAN"" data changed from 98.68% to 102.29% (as it stands now). Good comment. I will include this in the post itself.""*

Yea, the ""%Free float on loan"" actually increased by \~3.5% while I was posting/writing this, as the CLOSING BELL struck (I use TD Ameritrade's Thinkorswim platform like a real trading daddy should, and it rings the bell at close 4PM EST SHARP. So ya I fucking remember that moment like a Pavlovian bitch.) It *could* mean that the ORTEX data reflected up-to-date data then. Fucking coincidence, amirite? Regardless, WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO before all short positions are covered, if they even have started to cover today in the first place. So chill, daddy, it's all under control and shit. Sit back, relax, and continue to jerk off to your KINGLY GME gains.

Don't worry my brothers, I will keep on watching ORTEX data, even on Monday. We will track this bitch in every possible way. *Shorts will not get out alive.* Also, you can get ORTEX data yourself, with a free 7-day trial period. Not affiliated with them in any way. Just consider it if you want the raw data for yourself.

What I think happened - due to a small gamma squeeze that happened in GME today, this forced the shorts to cover by closing other short positions. (shorts in PLTR, FUBO... you get the picture.) 

What does this mean for us autists?

The shorts of GME have TRIPLED down!! They foolishly believe that the short interest in GME will not result in the largest short squeeze in human history - and they are WRONG. 

TLDR: Mad money to be made in any WSB meme stock in the coming days if GME continues to rise and the shorts have to continue to cover!

"Are Surges In GME, PLTR Related?",0.91,"Total speculation on my part here, and perhaps the professionals who frequent here can help us out on figuring out if the lemon has been squeezed.  A preface, as many posts today have said, QUIT MAKING THIS SHIT PERSONAL, DOXXING IS NEVER COOL.  This is about making tendies.

Citron has been most public about shorting GME, and y'all have well documented this week's PR cluster surrounding that, culminating in the announcement that they'll no longer talk about it.  

We also have quite a few posts that the bump today was someone's margin call.

More quietly, PLTR has been steadily climbing today, and is knocking on the door of all time highs.  A reminder that [Citron called PLTR a ""full casino"" way back in...November.](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/palantir-stock-price-target-short-selling-position-citron-research-pltr-2020-11-1029845368)

Presuming they've still got their position in PLTR too, and PLTR gaining 25% today, we know they're hurting.

Both GME and PLTR are ""hard to borrow"" stocks, with GME's available shares to short well documented daily here as well.  Anyone have a read on how many PLTR shares are out there, and whether we've got a squeeze going on now there?  And, just possibly, if a certain firm is going dark today not because of Doxxing, but because every time the phone rings, margin is calling? 

Whether it is Citron or not, it seems that today was a great day to be long meme stonks, and a horrible, horrible day to be a short seller.

Also, Rocket Rocket Rocket....  **🚀🚀🚀🚀** **🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Positions:  400 shares PLTR, 150 late to the party shares of GME.

STLD - Earnings Play - Mild DD,0.62,"GME is the monster here, so I don't want to distract from that. But Steel Dynamics (STLD) is a profitable steel manufacturer in the US that is reporti g their earnings on Monday, Jan 25th after hours.

I think this would be a good play and wanted to share. They typically beat earnings, and their Q4 earnings have historically led to a week or two of +10% gains following earnings from the end of January to mind-February.

Positive forces: Price of iron is down, expected production demand to increase in post covid environment, cheap cost of money will lead to increased infrastructure / capital improvements.

Potential alpha: STLD is rumored to be the supplier of steel for the TSLA Cybertruck. STLD is building a massive plant in Texas near the new Tesla Cybertruck factory. This hasn't been confirmed. 

Cons: It's steel. Steel is boring and typically take a long time to respond to market forces.

With that in mind, STLD recently upped their earnings guidance for Monday's release, and the stock is trading down vs 52wk highs. I would expect an earnings surprise and increased guidance for the rest of 2021 for a post covid schedule. This may not seem flashy, but when SNE had a similar surprise and guidance lift, their stock rose ~30%. 

Positions: 2/19/21 $35-42 Calls 1/22 leaps.

Lost shit ton of my savings because of Citron on PLTR. GME helped me recover all those losses plus a small profit and tax money.

Should I sell these options to lock gains and buy stocks instead? All the options are deep ITM (30/35) expiring in April. 

I’d rather not want to be in the same negative portfolio state.


EDIT: Sold about ~15% to convert to GME stocks. Bracing myself for the worst and hoping that I can get some more profit to get that down payment on the house.

I noticed something on today's run on Meme stock and would like to see if our smooth brains are agreeing on this.

I'm suspected that the runs from a couple of days and today Gamma Squeeze on GME probably forced some Shorters to cover their short position on GME by unloading their other heavily short position on wsb meme stock such as PLTR and other stocks to cover their ass.

Now PLTR is in the stratosphere without someone pulling them down even the hit pieces and also BB got another run from nowhere today even there is news of insider unloading their shares.

I expect to see more run on the stock market next week if this is true. Short are burning hard, and a lot of money is changing hands.

TLDR ; SOMEONE HEAVILY SHORT WSB MEME STOCK AND NOW HAVE TO COVER THEIR ASS BECAUSE OF GME

As promised boys here is the update from the stratosphere. We are now in the endgame(stop)

The rocket is fueled up and lift off is a go. The final nail in the coffin was Citron dropping his pants and presenting his rear with that embarrassing live-stream. The market sensed weakness and pounced.

Over the weekend the hedge funds will have many desperate meetings but will ultimately realize there is no way out. Come Monday more of them will undoubtedly crack and begin to cover. The first rats to jump ship will be wounded but will survive

When the price breaks 100, it will plateau as the remaining boomers and paperhands disembark the rocketship,

After the shorts realize no one else is selling, they will resume covering and the price will continue upward

If you are bullish on this stock (you should be) the fair value for this stock is now 169, not even accounting for the squeeze pressure . Check the excellent model put together by the folks over at [gmedd.com](https://www.gmedd.com/) who have done some amazing work

The next exit point is 300.

Cohen's previous company, Chewy trades at around 330 and the pet food market is a fraction of what video industry is worth. Long term, this stock will break 500 a slice no problem.

The danger here is not missing the peak (as it takes days for hedges to unwind huge positions) but selling too early, and you won't even be able to afford your initial stake after the squeeze has squozen

&#x200B;

As we approach 500+ we enter the land of diamond hands. Only the slow moving institutions and the true autistic diamond dick gods among us will make it this far.

&#x200B;

Either way this is a historic moment,

Lets get ready to redistribute some mother fucking money

AWWW did you miss out on GME? Lemme $TELL you your next multi bagger,0.41,"Tellurian ($TELL) is a liquified natural gas startup. Been around since 2011. Time, the industry, and Covid have not been kind to them, but they managed to survive. Pre covid levels this was $7 a share. They're now $3.00 a share with the wind behind their backs.  


&#x200B;

[Look at that VOLUME!!!!](https://preview.redd.it/yw4ebyqzqxc61.png?width=2251&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d6cdb3e47d6e7210cfac06454a103e2e945b889)

Now with soaring LNG prices in europe and asia, LNG facility (Driftwood) construction slated for summer, and with same founder behind Cheniere ($LNG) -  $TELL is poised to explode as soon as Deal is announced. 

TLDR: If you got a $1000 to blow heres some easy 100%ers or greater.

Long Value: shares 

Patience: 7/21 4.5c @ 1.00

YOLO 2/19 7c @ .1

Positions:

5000 shares $TELL @ 1.66

100 2/19 2.5C @ .15

100 1/2022 15c @ .35

As an analog, check out $LNG circa 2011. They shot up 1300% over the year after their announcement of their SAP (sale and purchase agreement) with GAIL (india's natural gas company).  


![img](r8s4jylkkxc61 ""$LNG rise from a low to a high circa 2011 - 2013(they currently are trading around 65 a share)
"")

Okay, you ask yourself, why not just buy a competitor, or hell $LNG to take advantage of these prices?  


Well, the growth potential. Duh.  And also long term value.

**Keys:**

**Source of gas** 

Tellurian is unique in that it will source its facilities with its own natural gas from Haynesville production. Haynesville also has ALOT of gas. This eliminates dealing with the volatility of purchasing it on an exchange like Henry Hub. This source brings the cost of gas to $2.00 MMbtu + $.75 debt service + $.75 transportation = $3.50 MMbtu

**Price and Buyers**

Then you consider okay, but how much can they sell their LNG for, and to who?

Europe and Asia. 

Clean enrgy policies, environmental image, and Russian seediness, middle east hesitancies all point to the US to help supply the hungry appetite for reliable energy.

Haven't heard this take on GME before,0.63,"Most of this article is fluff garbage but check out that one paragraph near bottom:

>But there's another level of danger to the gamma squeezes. This involves  the relentless, high-volume buying in low-priced far out-of-the-money  call options to drive a stock price higher by forcing the market maker  to purchase the stock as protection against their selling the calls,  assuming they can't find another party to take the risk. For market  makers unable to pass the risk, they could soon find themselves out of  business. We could also see market makers begin to abandon stocks.

Literal opposite of what's happening, from my understanding.  Highest priced call I can even see on RH is $60.

$GM & $F are jokes.,0.54,"Ford and General Motors are jokes. People in wall street are going crazy because these two stocks are years behind in EV's, the Microsoft deal is somewhat good news but using AI for cars takes experience and lots of data. I'm big on EV stocks and growth stocks, it doesn't take that much to impress me as long as there's potential and see proof.  GM and Ford are making EVs that have expensive old inefficient batteries and no software to make the motors independent to make them more efficient, they have no charging infrastructure and terrible milage. I'm more likely to put my money in $GOEV, $NIO, and Lucid motors when they're public. Startups have to innovate to stay alive, big carmakers have to put out a joke car so their investors think they will do something. Tesla has shown their innovators even while having the largest market cap and only delivering 500k cars a year. Telsa has the leg up in every sector but manufacturing power, which will change very soon. They have better software, better Machine learning, they have more EVs on the road giving their AI more data which makes it way better, their car efficiency is much better and they know how to make an EV  (now). They have better design and engineering, Ford and GM have a few cars combined Tesla has 4 out right now and 3 more on the way.  Ford and Gm even show that they are dependent on startups, remember GM and $NKLA instead of developing their own cars because they're too lazy they try buying a truck company that was public for a few months and no real working trucks.  Rivian and Ford not much more to say. Rivian is good but under funding from a joke car company, they will buy Rivian cut corners to make an easy cheap car. Ford and Gm arent innovators, you want a big car company that is somewhat serious good luck their plan is to buy a start-up.  Everyone wants TSLA to go to them, china loves tesla and they usually hate American companies that should prove how much countries want EV makers. The whole point is GM and F are jokes they got so used to making the same car and not needing anything they forgot how to innovate and bring change. VW their liars they can't even make a good ICE car how do you expect them to make a clean energy car without making an ICE emission problem almost no other carmakers have. You may see I'm a hardcore Tesla bull. You want 3 real cars $NIO and $TSLA and Lucid motors. You don't like Evs then GME and PLTR.  🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀. you can't make a car company into a high tech car company, you can't make a high tech company into a car company. they have to be one company, not a partnership.

$OSTK undervalued e-commerce play,0.59,"First time poster on WSB, and love the DD/YOLO/gain porn posts.

Its a struggle to find good undervalued ideas in this market, but here's one I like

**OSTK**: [Overstock.com](https://overstock.com/) is an e-commerce company. Current 2020 revenues is 2.5bn (67% up yoy over 2019) and the company trades at under $3bn market cap

* **Cheap vs. e-comm competitors**: Wayfair($W) trades at 2.4x EV/Sales, Etsy ($ETSY) trades at 19x EV/sales, Real ($REAL) trades at 5x EV/sales -> $OSTK trades at 1.1x EV/sales.
* **Industry tail-winds**: I'm sure everyone's seen those graphs of how e-commerce penetration is gone up from 17% to 30% last year. The sector is going through massive disruptions, and $OSTK is capturing it
* **Management turn-around**: In Sep 2019, Overstock replaced its eccentric owner Patrick Bryne (who has no involvement now), and replaced him with Jonathan Johnson who has focused on execution and helped turn it around into a profitable e-comm biz, growing revenues 50% yoy. (Shades of $GME, $BB)
* **Q4 earnings outperformance:** Street estimates Q4 revenue of $650mm, which is down 12% qoq which makes no sense. Every year, Q4 revenues have been higher than Q3 (holiday shopping, black friday etc) and this year should be no different. The amount of online shopping this year was enormous compared to years past due to pandemic, so no reason why we should not set a quarterly record.
* **Disruptive startup** **portfolio**: see comments
* **Technical set-up:** I'm no technical wizard, but check out some of the popular accounts on Twitter on $OSTK. Its breaking out of a wedge and is about to moon. In my opinion, if it breaks 75, we will see 100-120 soon.
* **Short interest:** 18%
* **Strong cash position:** They have >$500mm in cash, and the stock has not recovered since their secondary offering (down 50% from ATH)

**$OSTK Positions:** Long 900 stock, Long 9 Mar calls at 75, Long 6 June calls at 75 🚀

"For those who doubted $GME, Part 2:",0.35,"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwjyhm/for_those_who_doubted_gme/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

[DD for idiots.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxl1ku/tomorrows_best_play/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

I’d like to start off by saying, this is not about $GME.

It’s about $PLTR. 🚀

I’m going to state my opinion on GME first however so I can get the criticism out of the way. I made my profits, got in at about $37, and I honestly doubted myself if it’d go up. I believed in you guys, and believed in u/DeepFuckingValue more than anything. I admit; I cashed out today at $71 per share. I made some good returns and whether or not it continues to rise is beyond me, I hope it does but I also hope that all the people who get in today don’t become bag holders. It’s really stressful, especially not knowing where the peak is gonna be. However, this is where I draw everyone’s attention to the best play yet to be made.

Today in PLTR’s unpredictable (yet predictable if you check my linked posts) journey we saw a good 15% run, and is still continuing to do so. Reason being that there’s a major demo-day happening for $PLTR on Tuesday. Followed by earning reports shortly after. This means everyone’s wanting to buy in now before the weekend and not having to get in last minute on Monday the day before. This small gain is only a fraction of what $PLTR is capable of doing, I recommend reading [this deep dive for retards](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxl1ku/tomorrows_best_play/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) if you’re clueless on why Palantir is a good buy. 

Here’s why I’m making a part two:

WSB is unstoppable, if you’re still a doubter. That’s probably because you’re a paper handed fuck who checks RH every hour of the day and wets themselves when they see -5%. If you want to play a little more passive for guaranteed free money, PLTR is the move. Upon this demo-day and earnings report I’m expecting nothing but good news, which leads us to lockup. 

Lockup will be happening very soon as well, that’s when 80% of the current stock that’s unavailable to be trader because it’s held by insiders (employees and some investors) will able to be publicly trader. You may think that’s a bad thing, however it’s not. Yes, I do think lots of shares will be sold off. Although, this allows huge investment firms to be able to finally get their hands on some PLTR shares that they haven’t been able to receive since its DPO. If major investment firms start claiming those shares upon lockup, then this is the inevitable moon we’ve all been waiting for. But what if they don’t buy up these shares? That’s where we come in. You’ve done it with $GME, you had faith in DeepFuckingValue. Now, have faith in $PLTR and Shuffil. You can either buy some shares now, which may seem high but I promise it’s only a fraction because $PLTR is the best long-term hold currently in the entire market. That’s a bold claim, but we all know it’s true. Just look at its infantile competition $SNOW, which IPO’d at @$200+. Take those $GME tendies and set yourself up for the Tesla of data analysis, something all companies will need in order to succeed in the future. 

TL;DR: Buy PLTR with $GME tendies. PLTR demo-day next week, followed by earning report shortly after.

VIDEO: Bill Ackman and JCPenney Parallels to GameStop,0.58,"You should watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2C2Z75X6_g4&feature=youtu.be) of Bill Ackman talking about why his investment in JCPenney failed if you want to learn something.  The similarities between this story and GameStop's current situation is pretty interesting I think.  And this is NOT me implying the same thing will happen or that the situations are identical; I just find the insight interesting.  

Both stories include an activist investor who grabs a few spots on the board of an older retailer with the goal of turning the company around.

GME HALT TIME FOR $BB PUMP 🚀🚀,1.0,,2021-01-22 18:04:46
GME - I think this is a Gamma Squeeze where dealers COULD NOT hedge fast enough,0.92,"***You guys did it. By concentrating enough WSB autism in one point in the form of $60 call options, you created a previously unproven distortion of the fabric of vol/price/time known as a Degenerity, where vol became price, green became red (for dealers) red became green (for option holders), bears like me get excited for bulls, and the market broke, spawning a wormhole to a new universe where GME is somehow above it's ATH, and spraying out a massive field distortion via degenerons, which are now being detected on CNBC.  It's like a black hole, but with options. I look forward to those with PhDs in physics and finance expanding upon this theory. Expect additional unforseen repercussions such as*** r/investing ***advocating a 10% allocation to ""YOLO"" in their now 4 fund portfolio (domestic stocks, global stocks, bonds, YOLO).***

**TLDR: I think Market Makers got completely screwed today by this sub's unprecedented call buying yesterday. Expect some people to get fired. They normally can hedge their calls they sold you buying stock as price moves, but there wasn't supply for them to buy the 15m shares they needed in the 3 hour period this AM, and realy, a good 8-10m of that need happened in a few minute period which was when the market broke. I suspect MM's are going to be in the hole $100-200 million today. And yeah, some people are getting fired. You guys did it - you made the Degenerity! GME hit an all time high price (but not all time high market cap)**

&#x200B;

**Not a short squeeze:**

I don't think this is a short squeeze primarily. I think we are actually seeing a gamma squeeze in which dealers could not hedge as quickly as their short calls lost value, and citadel and other market makers are losing hundreds of millions today as a group, which almost never happens, especially at this scale.

Shorts don't HAVE to cover until there are 0 shares to borrow and they get bought in. They may get margin called before, but institutions diversify. And there are shares to borrow to an extent, rate still 22% on IB. I'm sure some of this happened, but you can't really force this until the many hundreds on a typical hedge fund book.

On the other hand, looking at options, OI went up a lot overnight - I sadly did not check this AM. You now have 80K calls expiring today at 55 to 60 bucks, then another 70k next week, and another maybe 50k at longer dates. That is what we call...  🚀 ⛽

That's 200k, or 20m shares!!! To hedge that at 63+ you need... about 20m shares.  Of course, some are thetagang short options, so call it 15m shares. Keep in mind, dealers had 25-30m shares before this going into today, so they now want to hold 40-45m shares (on 110m sythethic float of loaned shares + real shares) 🚀 ⛽ 🚀 ⛽ 🚀 ⛽

When the ramp started around 55, dealers had to rush to buy shares, but could not get 15m shares between $50 and $60.  When it hit $60, there was a HUGE amount of options all at once, and market liquidity was insufficient (""The Degenerity""). At the writing of this post in the morning during the halt, it means they are losing $10m per dollar move in the price, and will pay any price to stop the bleeding. I'm sure some guys in their risk mgmt department are getting fired over this, as the writing was on the wall, and they still sold you guys calls - they should've been charging $10 a call yesterday to protect themselves, or offering much higher strikes to tempt money into that and away from over-concentrating at $60. I suspect when the dust settles, we will find out that the better market makers BOUGHT calls from other market makers, and would not be surprised if there's an 8-k from a market maker tonight about exceptional losses. You may actually bankrupt a small one. Because the mass of calls at $60 got so heavy, it became impossible to hedge in real time.

In terms of gamma conditions from here, there's no remaining real ramp once you are at around 63.

**Edit #3: Previously said we would see stagnation right under $60 because dealers have an interest in a $60 close and probably own 40m+ shares at this point offsetting the huge short calls - and had to unload 6m shares in ITM calls ending today. But it looks like they either don't care or are losing control with this hot close at $64.75. Going to be a lot of share delivery into Monday, maybe as much as 10m.  That'll be interesting to sort out.**

**I'm a bear, but seriously, congrats bulls, you did break the market, but maybe not in the way you think you did. I really think the guys you screwed today were MMs, probably on the order of $100-200m... I have profound respect for what you did. Yes, my puts sucked, I'm down $35k all together on trying to play this one. You are welcome, you deserve it.**  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

And I'm really dumb for not checking open interest this morning. Writing was on the wall due to all the calls you guys bought yesterday. It's infuriating when you know you could've seen it in plain sight and were too busy doing something else to check.

I do think MMs will be more careful on this moving forward and make this less likely to repeat. This epic failure on their part is going to attract CIO level oversight. Unlike the meltup last Wednesday where they got to hedge smoothly, they were not able to hedge here.

Also, wanted to link you guys Martin Shkreli's comments on the GME situation from YESTERDAY via people who have access to him I guess by phone (since he still has about a year of federal prison left)? Very interesting. Looking forward to his read as someone who's squeezed someone before:

$GME 7500% Call loss cuz Paper Hands,0.88,"On the 15th GME was trading at $30 and I bought $150 worth of Calls, strike price $50 expiring on the 22nd. I had lost a bit of money from other option trades earlier that week and I decided I was done with day trading so I pulled out my remaining balance and cashed out my call options on the 19th. I wake up today and see that my $150 would have been worth $10,000 if I just held. Im broke af so this kinda sucks but I learned paper hands are never the way.

🚀TSM World Domination: Beyond the moon.,0.8,"Don’t call me crazy yet, let me explain.

If you’ve been on this subreddit or know anything about meme stocks, you know about the stocks that have skyrocketed recently. GME, AMD, PLTR, AAPL, TSLA, NVIDIA, CRSR, etc. 

There is a stock that almost all the big tech companies, EV companies, and meme stocks had in common. TSM

If you don’t know what TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing) makes computer chips. You definitely own at least one TSM chip, whether you know it or not. 

Here is a list of a few of the companies that manufacture their chips with TSMC: (from [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20leading%20fabless%20semiconductor%20companies%20such,such%20as%20Allwinner%20Technology%2C%20HiSilicon%2C%20Spectra7%2C%20and%20Spreadtrum.))

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Apple Inc., Nvidia, Intel, Qualcomm, Xilinx,  Altera,Texas Instruments. 

It would take me years to research every single product that TSMC manufactures, but here are a few of the most significant ones that I found:


AMD:All AMD chips are manufactured by TSM any reason to buy AMD is also a reason to buyTSM 
   AMD CPU’s: This also includes AMD Ryzen Processors which are the most bought CPUS on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computers-Accessories-Computer-CPU-Processors/zgbs/pc/229189) As well as the processors that go into many laptops. 
   AMD Graphics Cards: Apple uses AMD Graphics card in their Mac products. They are also in many windows PC’s and laptops, and they are used by miners. 
   Xbox/PlayStation Internals: The PS5 and Xbox Series both use AMD CPU’s and Graphics, which are manufactured by TSM. 

Apple: Apple manufactures All of its processors at TSM. TSM made chips are in every iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, Air Pod, etc. the new M1 Apple in house silicon Macs are also made by TSM. 

Nvidia: Nvidia is the world largest GPU company. They also make self driving processors for Tesla, Nio and other companies. 

Qualcomm: Qualcomm makes Arm processors. Qualcomm processors power everything from Samsung phones to smart TV’s to Amazon Alexa. 

Xilinx: they make most of the 5G processors that go in towers and phones. Samsung Phones use Xilix cellular chips. 

Texas Instruments: they make your fucking calculator. 

There are many many more companies that TSM manufactures chips for. They are also on a more advanced process mode than any other company in the world. Do some of your own research and find out what other products TSM makes. 

See how many products in your life are powered by TSM. 

Chances are, A TSM manufactured chip could be inside your phone, your computer, your TV, your smart speaker and other smart home devices, your wifi router, your cars radio/gps, your cars self driving system (if your car has it). Your wireless headphones, the cell tower in your neighborhood. Even your calculator.

The “cloud” is also powered by TSM. The servers that google, Amazon, one drive, Spotify, Palantir, etc. 

If you can find just one area of technology that does not, at some point, use TSM manufacturing, comment it below. 

If you can’t then buy some fucking shares. 🚀🚀🚀",2021-01-22 17:08:29

Update on GME VSA,0.98,"I made a post yesterday about watching interest at highs.

&#x200B;

Just wanted to update this mornings trading so far made new highs (during NYSE on-hours) on low volume relative to previous volumes.

&#x200B;

I can't see off market volume in relation to open hours charts. Take that into consideration.

&#x200B;

TLDR = Relatively low interest at highs = no ceiling yet for rockets

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xxbwojq1iwc61.png?width=3512&format=png&auto=webp&s=6529d1c29532656a50eaca5cb277fd3aba7b5b70

Please tell me if this is annoying or if this is interesting. I'm doing it for myself anyway and will stop posting if no interest.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

UPDATE 12:05 PM

Some significant volume at what COULD be a high. Volume the highest over the last 3 days of trading, but not exactly climactic in terms of the last two weeks of trading.

&#x200B;

If this is indeed a high, I would expect a retracement and then look for buying interest to come back in, hopefully.

&#x200B;

UPDATE 12:20 PM

https://preview.redd.it/dzjfymg04xc61.png?width=3519&format=png&auto=webp&s=48078c1df6bb3d41f5ef69edf3cb636fb08abe21

This is what significant volume looks like. 

However, as I am typing this price just broke this high volume candle.

Volume coming in but overwhelming demand it looks like steamrolling. Some big dick boomer just hit buy because his son on wsb convinced him.

GME SHARES PURCHASED
https://imgur.com/a/WZ3O6Hr

First, forgive me for my cowardice. I should have joined you earlier but I was afraid. I am new to this. In time I hope to grow massive balls like you lot.

I also want to thank citron and andrew cleft. After yesterday’s ‘live stream’ I felt he lacked conviction in his belief, this was evident in the way he spoke. A lot of Ah’s and Um’s, complete lack of charisma and confidence. Subjective but still. That and he did say some stupid things like issuing more shares to pay down debt. Which generally you don’t do (but can). He shouldn't be giving management advice if his goal is to short a share. The most important thing is this, conviction and faith. Have that, which he, and to point I lacked. Already you have seen people who had the balls to jump in make gainz.  Also as u/An_EliteMind_Ihope pointed out, citron is clearly lying, thank you for sharing this friend. 

Also want to thank u/DeepFuckingValue for his hard work. If I miss anybody I apologize. I usually lurk here.

The other thing I want to share is for anyone that was afraid to invest. A few days ago I sold about 814 shares of Nio and realized a gain of about $41,901. I apologize for the proof.

https://imgur.com/a/VFryR9L

Here in Canada half of that is taxable so $20,950. I originally sold to buy BB and PLTR. I still have positions in NIO, I do believe in it and I like how the company is being managed. However, I also purchased GME. The point is this if I get a loss I can net that against my gains. I’d rather make more money than pay my incompetent government taxes.  Since it is the beginning of 2021 I won’t have to pay taxes till like May or April of 2022. It also gives me a whole year to sit on this and realize those gains/losses when I need to. Plenty of time to get my shit in order. At the same time, you don’t have to sell. If you get a loss eventually any other position might gain that allows you to plan things out long term. If these companies are doing things you like ride it out. Ride to die. Don’t be a coward. As you have seen others have sold on  poisitions to diversify too.  Just some incentive for you folks. Now I am in Canada, and I am sure the US has similar tax rules. 

That is all I really wanted to say. This last bit is personal. I know I have bugged some of you guy’s for guidance and advice. I want to throw this out there. I do want to get into options trading or learn how to do analysis like you guys. I have somewhat learned by reading these threads and studying independently. I don’t care about being rich, I just hate being a loser in my 30’s. I am the son of immigrants, and all I have wanted to do is provide for and take care of my family. I want you to understand that so if you have some guidance or knowledge that has helped you please please dm me. That is all.",2021-01-22 14:47:33
Why GME might squeeze to 400$? 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀,0.88,"I am a retard trying to understand short squeeze

As per Yahoo finance, the total float is **47M**. The total shares shorted as of Dec 30 is **71M**. A lot of the insiders e.g. **RC** won’t sell their shares irrespective of squeeze. The total outstanding share stands at **69M**. Even if the management decided to offer **20M** shares, it still does not seem enough to cover short positions.

So, how will the short position be covered ? Buying the same shares multiple times? Can someone explain ?

If management does offer a certain amount of shares directly to hedge funds, can those shares be traded in the open market? If they can't rinse and repeat, then an offering from management still does not seem enough to cover short positions.

Now, GME management is fully aware of the situation. So, at what price point do we expect them to offer more shares considering they can dictate prices. Let's say, they offer 20M shares @ 200 raising 4B. That would be enough to pay off all debts and GME will have 3B in cash. However, since these shares won't be enough, the prices should still continue to rise.

That's why I think even though a price of 400$ seems highly unlikely, it is possible. GME to **420.69$**  🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀",2021-01-22 14:45:22

Here’s what we know. 

Canoo - $GOEV has a deal with Hyundai to provide them with their B2B skateboard platform for their new electric cars. This is great and all, but let’s be honest, we’re not moving away from GME for a fucking Hyundai here. All you fuckers have Lambos and Tesla’s already, no time for that shit. 

So here we are back in the glory days of February 2020. TSLA, SPCE, PLUG, and Lumber Liquidators were rocketing 🚀🚀🚀 off to the moon 🌖. No wearing a fucking mask all day, we could drink with our friends, pass a blunt, and snort cocaine off hookers asses without first having to douse them in sanitizer. Ah the good ol days... anyways back to this gem of a deal that has brought us to where we are today. 

Hyundai and Canoo collaborate and agree to use Canoo’s skateboard platform for their upcoming EVs. See article below;

[Hyundai News Release](https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/2982)

Also check out the skateboard (slick marketing, very inline with a fruit named company 🍎)

[Slick as fuck Skateboard video](https://youtu.be/3ucsFNUTqtM)

Now I know your pants are starting to get a little tight or damp, and that’s ok, but stay with me here. 

Hyundai acquired Kia back in the 90’s, as a whole they sell about 7 million or so cars a year. They have set a goal of 25% of their cars sold to be electric by 2025 (not that far away). 

For those who can somehow read, but aren’t so good with this things that aren’t letters but are used in math. Let’s do some for you. 

7,000,000 cars x 25% = 1,750,000 that’s like, over a million for the folks above. Now I’m sure you’re wondering where the fuck are my rockets??? 🚀🚀🚀 There have a couple to keep you going through the next bit. 

Let’s move ahead to current day, world’s a fucking mess 😷, but Shittron is eating some of that 💩 for breakfast because they’re broke as fuck after trying to short GME. 🌈🐻s have all realized Stonks only go 📈, and they’re looking for a way to rebuild their kids education fund after blowing it all on puts. Apple has decided they want some of that dirty Tesla action, and head out looking for a way to get into the electric car business. Not knowing how the fuck you actually make a car, they go out looking for someone who does since they hope to be selling 400,000 cars by 2025ish. Here comes Hyundai, yeah they used to make shitboxes that no one other than Shittron employees and 🌈🐻s would drive, but now they’re stepping up their game. They’ve partnered with this up and coming company, who are doing some pretty cool shit - Canoo. 

So hypothetically Apple has been rumoured to be working with Hyundai/Kia for their new car, who had partnered with Canoo to use their skateboard as a base. So here we are with this little stonk with a market cap of somewhere around $4 Billion and a $17 share price. 

[Article about Apple working with Hyundai/Kia](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/apple-car-kia-hyundai-work/)

Skip this if you don’t want numbers, but I think you’re going to like this part. 

Canoo is going to be making some cars, yeah cool, whatever. The real value in here though is their B2B skateboard platform for EVs. We already figured out if Hyundai is selling 1.75 Million cars, and Apple wants another 400k or so, we’re now over 2 million cars a year. I’m going to go ahead and guess that this skateboard is worth somewhere conservatively between 5,000 - 10,000 (Canoo has already said their cars will cost 33,000, so I’ve estimated but let’s call it $7,500). 

2 million cars x $7,500 = A whole lot of fucking 

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Or give or take $15,000,000,000 yup $15 Billion fucking 💵. We’ll go with a revenue multiplier of 5x because I think that’s fair. 

5 x 15,000,000,000 = $75,000,000,000 Valuation. 

Let’s remember today’s market cap is $4 Billion. 4B x 18.75 = 75B again for all you simple folks out there that’s 18 full rockets 

🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 + a semi erect dick. 

So is this Tesla, not yet, but am I in for a potential 18x ride to the moon? Fucking right I am! 

Now let’s show this little stonk some love, and make some fucking Millionaires. 

TLDR 

GOEV = 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 + a semi erect dick. 

Side Note: Don’t be the guy that has to live with telling people that you sold your Canoo stock at $25 💎🙌🏼 Let’s go to tendie town

EDIT: Thanks for the awards, but buy positions instead!

For all clarity my position in this is small, but adding whenever I have cash available.

"The ultimate meme stock, $WOOF! WSB Idiot DD",0.8,"$WOOF!

It's more than just a funny ticker name, it's a lifestyle. From the time I was a young boy, I knew that dogs would one day rule the world. The four-legged barking fuckers stole the hearts of humans and just ripped them right out, especially when they did something cute.

And then last week, something amazing happened. PETCO went public again, under the ticker name $WOOF.

**Why the fuck should you listen to me?**

I'm the clown that's been calling all of the non-GME (and GME things) things that have been making money in the discord these past few weeks. I'm the guy that brought you:

* PLUG
* FCEL
* ICLN
* BNGO
* TLRY, APHA, and other weed stocks
* Other shit

**What's so great about this company?**

First and foremost, obviously, the ticker. But beyond that, the company itself has undergone an incredible transformation, moving from a brick-and-mortar retail store to offering pet health and pet care services (not just retail ones, higher quality ones), and moving into more advanced pet care, such as theraputics.

A few points:

* PETCO's annual revenue in 2019 was $4.43B
* Their market cap isn't even 2x revenue, at $7.9B - spelling out that this stock is MASSIVELY undervalued
* Their top competitor, CHEWY, had revenue of $3.5B, but a market cap of $40B - more than 10x its revenue.
* PETCO, a traditional brick and mortar business, has massively grown it's e-commerce platform. As an example of this, in October of 2020, it had almost 20 million website visits, compared to about 20% of that in October of 2019.
* This company has existed since 1965, and while other similar businesses have faltered, they have stayed open.
* Pet ownership has increased more than 21% during COVID (thanks u/fallenangel51294), and young people spend more on their pets.

**What the fuck do I have invested?**

A group of us on the WSB Discord have nearly 20,000 shares combined, plus options. Best list I can come up with, below:

* 2,500 shares at $26.50 average
* 11,000 shares at $27.50 average
* 5,000 shares at $29.50 average
* We've also seen a few users buying 2/19 and 3/19 30c.

**What else is there to know?**

This is an IPO, almost 90% of which have been highly successful in recent years, including $WOOF's primary competitors.

**Target Price?**

Some analysts are suggesting this is worth $70, others $100. If I had to guess, this stock could reach $30ish-$35 EOM, and go even further in Feb/Mar.

*Obviously, I'm just another idiot on the internet. Do your own DD if you want, but I'm heavily into WOOF.*

How luck plays an important role in the stock market (GME and others),0.95,"Fellow retards,

I noticed that this sub is going to hit 2 million people soon, and I have decided to put aside my project assignments to write this DD (albeit more towards psychologically) on why luck is extremely important in the stock market, and what you can do to potentially get in favor of luck. Before I start, I want to congratulate you on being here. You have came a long way in life, and there’s more to come. Be happy.

**TLDR at the last paragraph.**

I want to talk mainly 3 things; luck, the psychology behind investing and what you should do to maximize profits. 

**Luck**

In the book 'The Drunkard's Walk', under chapter of 'Illusions of Patterns and Patterns of Illusion', and I quote: ""In 1978, Koppett revealed a system that he claimed could determine, by the end of January every year, whether the stock market would go up or down in that calendar year. His system had correctly predicted the market, he said, for the past eleven years. Of course, stock-picking systems are easy to identify in hindsight; the true test is whether they will work in the future. Koppett's system passed that test too: judging the market by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, it worked for eleven straight years, from 1979 through 1989, got it wrong in 1990, and was correct again every year until 1998. But although Koppett's predictions were correct for a streak of eighteen out of nineteen years, I feel confident in asserting that his streak involved no skill whatsoever. Why? Because Leonard Koppett was a columnist for *Sporting News*, and his system was based on the results of the Super Bowl, the championship game of professional football. Whenever the team from the (original) National Football league won, the stock market, he predicted, would rise.""

In the book 'Fooled by Randomness', the Prologue mentioned ""...luck disguised and perceived as nonluck (that is, skills) and, more generally, randomness disguised and perceived as non-randomness (that is, determinism). ""

In the book ‘The Black Swan’ by Taleb Nassim Nicholas, Page 119 mentioned "" A successful person will try to convince you that his achievements could not possibly be accidental, just as a gambler who wins at roulette seven times in a row will explain to you that the odds against such a streak are one in several million, so you either have to believe some transcendental intervention is in play or accept his skills and insight in picking the winning numbers."" More often than not, luck is rarely on your side. I can provide many other articles, but I believe you get the point. **To emphasize it, ""the habit of mistaking luck for skill is most prevalent - and most conspicuous - and that is the world of markets.""**

So why am I saying all these? What I am trying to imply is, do appreciate your GME gains, or whatever astronomical gains that you have. These gains, more often than not, are results of extremely lucky happenstances, where most people are incapable of harnessing them. Yes, there are tons of good DDs. But you yourselves are incredibly lucky to be part of WSB, and personally reading the DDs yourselves, and lucky enough to decide that you would be retarded enough to take the risk. You should be happy and grateful about it, because like I said, this is hugely, and heavily dependent on luck. Humans are flawed, because we have the tendency to look for specific causes that lead to effects. We often find it hard to accept that an event can be the result of total randomness, but sometimes it is. In financial forecasting, several times random volatility is mistaken for accurate prediction. In a group of many analysts, it is normal to expect that someone's predictions will turn out to be true (u/DeepFuckingValue). So, in case you get way too ahead of yourselves thinking you are absolutely a genius for having triple percentage gains in your portfolio, remember you're most likely just lucky. And since you're lucky, be appreciative and do not be complacent. 

**Psychology behind Investing**

Several studies have fooled people into believing they are in control of something they actually have no control over. In fact, human decision-making shows systematic simplifications and deviations from the tenets of rationality (‘heuristics’) that may lead to suboptimal decisional outcomes (‘cognitive biases’). There are currently three prevailing theoretical perspectives on the origin of heuristics and cognitive biases: a cognitive-psychological, an ecological and an evolutionary perspective. To simplify that, it basically means that cognitive biases arise from intrinsic brain mechanisms that are fundamental for the working of our neural networks. Your mind is always on the cautious side of things, because it is trying to protect you.

Remember a time when you were very near the edge of a building/cliff, and all of a sudden you feel hypersensitive to the surrounding around you? You are aware of every rocks and stones that might sabotage you. Another example can be that you shiver when peeing, because your body is exaggerating the signal that you are rapidly losing body heat, and is trying to shiver up the muscle fiber to keep you warm, etc. You get the idea. 

This unfortunately, applies in investing as well. Your mind will inevitably forces you to be on the safer side. A dip? Oh no... you panic. But relax, that is normal. In my last point, I will explain what you can do to overcome it.

**What you can do to stay calm?**

So now you know that it is in human nature to be a paper handed bitch. The first step is realizing that your own neural networks are playing a huge part in giving you a paper hand. When you realized that it is your own mind that is keeping you on the safer side, perhaps you can be more self-aware. Being impatient in the market is the worst mistake that you would commit while investing in the stocks. You have to know that if you do not have good patience in the market then you would find difficulty in getting the right stocks for your investment. You have to finally take your own decisions when you wish to select the stocks. Remember however, you do have to be lucky to hit the jackpot on certain investments as per my first point. 

Confirmation bias is also a bitch. As philosopher Francis Bacon put it in 1620, ""the human understanding, once it has adopted an opinion, collects any instances that confirm it, and though the contrary instances may be more numerous and more weighty, it either does not notice them or else rejects them, in order that this opinion will remain unshaken."" This happens very often in WSB, and I want you to be cautious as well. To show you how easy confirmation bias is, imagine I have 5 numbers here. After presenting you these numbers, I want you to guess what is the rule of the game. Here are the 5 numbers: 4 6 8 10 12. What will your next 3 numbers be? What is the rule of the game? The rule is: >!Increasing Numbers, the next 3 numbers can be 13 14 15!< Most of you might have guessed ""increasing even numbers and provided with 14 16 18, when in fact it is not. 

Luck does not solely come from deciding whether to listen to another retard's DD on a thread, and YOLO-ing your life savings onto some stocks. It also comes in the form of your birth status, etc. Having a $100,000 head start in the stock market, is almost always better than someone having $1000 as a starting capital (or worse still, negative capital simply because your parents are poor, that's unlucky).

That being said, I believe all of us here are in some way privileged to be gathered here and discussing individually. The poor kids in some countries have to fight for clean water and food. So the next time you realized that you are earning money in the stock market, remember, it is incredibly hard to do it, and you should be proud of yourselves. And in the scenario where you lose your money, well, you shouldn't be surprised either way. You are bound to be losing. 

Here are some books you can refer to if you're interested: The Drunkard’s Walk by Leonard Mlodinow (How Randomness Rules Our Lives), Fooled by Randomness by Taleb N, The Black Swan by Taleb N, Who’s in Charge? by Michael S. Gazzaniga (on Free will and the science of the brain), Success and Luck by Robert H. Frank, The Most Good You Can Do (How effective altruism is changing ideas about living ethically) by Peter Singer. 

Clarification: Some people mentioned if this post was directed to ""diminish the contributions of skill and the hard effort of anyone"". Absolutely not. ~~This post is assuming that in the top few % (if you're reading this, yourself included), everyone is just as talented.~~ But to be part of that 1% in that 1%, to be the richest among the richest, you have to be incredibly lucky. 

**TLDR**: If you make huge gains, go and give some of it to other people that may not have been so lucky. Go and give it to the homeless people at the unemployment line, who ain't so lucky as you. Maybe buy him food. Get him clothes. Donate to your local charities. Most importantly, give it back to your parents, because your parents are the one who, most likely, set you up in this direction, and you are lucky enough to be here today. If you did not make any gains, remember, it is perfectly okay.

**Shorter TLDR**: Be happy, be grateful.

Reminiscences of a YOLO Investor: GME 💎🙌,0.94,"*Exerpt from Reminiscences of a YOLO Investor*

One day a fellow named Paper Hands rushed into the office, typed out an order on Robinhood and sent it. Then he rushed over to where Mr. Diamond Hands was listening politely to Jimmy Shill's story of the time he overheard some autist give an order to one of his brokers and all that Jimmy made was a measly thirty points on a hundred shares of TSLA and of course the stock had to go up twenty-four hundred points in three months right after Jim sold out. It was at least the fourth time that Jim had told him that  tale of woe, but old 33-year old Diamond Hands (aka u/deepfuckingvalue) was smiling as sympathetically as if it was  the first time he heard it. 

Well, Paper Hands made for the old chad and, without a word of apology to Jimmy Shill, told u/deepfuckingvalue, “Mr. Diamond Hands, I have just sold my GME shares. My people say the market is entitled to a reaction and that I’ll be able to buy it back cheaper. So you’d better do likewise. That is,  if you’ve still got yours.” 

Paper Hands looked suspiciously at the chad to whom he had given the  original tip to buy. The amateur, or gratuitous, tipster always thinks  he owns the receiver of his tip body and soul, even before he knows how the tip is going to turn out. 

“Yes, Mr. Paper-Pussy-Hands, I still have it. Of course!” said u/deepfuckingvalue gratefully. It was nice of Paper Hands to think of the old chad. “Well, now is  the time to take your profit and get in again on the next dip,” said Paper Hands, as if he had just made out the sell market-order for the old chad. 

Failing to perceive enthusiastic gratitude in the beneficiary’s face Paper Hands went on: “I have just sold every share I owned!” From his voice  and manner you would have conservatively estimated it at ten thousand  shares. 

But Mr. Diamond Hands shook his head regretfully and whined, “No! No! I can’t do that!” 

“What?” yelled Paper Hands. 

“I simply can’t!” said Mr. Diamond Hands. He was in great trouble. 

“Didn’t I give you the tip to buy it?” 

“You did, Mr. Paper-Pussy-Hands, and I am very grateful to you. Indeed, I am, sir. But” 

“Hold on! Let me talk! And didn’t that stock go up twenty points in ten days? Didn’t it?” 

“It did, and I am much obliged to you, my dear boy. But I couldn’t think of selling that stock.” 

“You couldn’t?” asked Paper Hands, beginning to look doubtful himself. It is a habit with most tip givers to be tip takers. 

“No, I couldn’t.” 

“Why not?” And Paper Hands drew nearer.

**“Why, this is a retard-strength bull market!”** The old fellow said it  as though he had given a long and detailed explanation. “That’s all right,” said Paper Hands, looking angry because of his disappointment. “I know  this is a retarded bull market as well as you do. But you’d better sell that stock of yours and buy it back on the reaction. You might as well  reduce the cost to yourself.” “My dear boy,” said old u/deepfuckingvalue, in  great distress **“my dear boy, if I sold that stock now I’d lose my position; and then where would I be?”**  Paper Hands threw up his little pussy hands, shook his head and walked over to me to get sympathy… “I give him a tip on Gamestop. He buys fifty thousand shares. He’s got 35 points profit and I advise him to get out and buy ’em back on the reaction that’s overdue even now. And what does he say when I tell him? He says that if he sells he’ll lose his *tendies*. What do you know about that?” 

“I beg your pardon, Mr. Paper-Pussy-Hands; I didn’t say I’d lose my *tendies*,” cut  in old u/deepfuckingvalue. “I said I’d lose my position. And when you are as old as I  am and you’ve been through as many booms and panics as I have, you’ll  know that to lose your position is something nobody can afford; not even Papa Elon.

I hope the stock reacts and that you will be able to repurchase your  line at a substantial concession, sir. But I myself can only trade in  accordance with the experience of many years. I paid a high price for it  and I don’t feel like throwing away a second tuition fee, especially at boomer valuations. But I am as  much obliged to you as if I had the money in the bank. **It’s a retard-strength bull market, you know.**” 

And he moonwalked away, leaving Paper Hands dazed. What old Mr. Diamond Hands said did not mean much to me until I began to think about my own  numerous failures to make as much money as I ought to when I was so right on the memestonk market. The more I studied the more I realized how  wise that old chad was. 

He had evidently suffered from the same defect in his young days and  knew his own human bi-curious bear weaknesses. He would not lay himself open to a  temptation that experience had taught him was hard to resist and had  always proved expensive to him, as it was to me.

I think it was a long step forward in my trading education when I  realized at last that when old Mr. Diamond Hands kept on telling the other retards, “**Well, you know this is a retard-strength bull market!**” he really meant to  tell them that the big money was not in the individual fluctuations but in the main movements that is, not in reading the crayon drawings, but in sizing up  the entire market's fed-steroid-injected, retard-strength, bigly gigantic hulk dick and its trend. 

And right here let me say one thing: After spending many years in  Wall Street and after making and losing millions of dollars I want to tell you this: It never was my thinking that made the big money for me.  It always was my 💎🙌. Got that?

For instance ABNB has 100 billion market cap, a revenue of less than 5 billion, is losing money, and revenue growth is questionable amid pandemic.

GME has 3 billion market cap, 5 billion revenue, could be profitable soon, and revenue growth is almost guaranteed with console supercycle and new business and product lines. Yet, ABNB market cap is 30-40x times that of GME just because it is a “unicorn”.

Seems to me GME is way undervalued, or ABNB is way overvalued, or maybe both.

Future of WSB,0.96,"**I've been mainly lurking for a few years and in my opinion, there are currently a few issues regarding this subreddit:**

&#x200B;

* too much publicity

WSB was originally a small community of autists wanting to make big gains with smart plays. Today WSB is more like an open discussion board, that's all over the news, and everyone can join and try to make some gains.  It's good to have a decent amount of players here but let's keep the information to ourselves and off the newspapers and CNBC. There is only a limited amount of gains to be made, let's keep the gains to ourselves and the boomers away. Also, what was the point of expanding to Twitter?

* too many new wannabe autists

WSB is on the frontpage of reddit like every other day with memes, and it attracts a lot of new members. Those new members aren't true autists and they clearly have hard time adjusting to our culture. This has caused attacking certain parties that we don't agree with, pump and dump schemes, lots of stupid posts and upvoting them, that nobody would have upvoted 6 months ago and so on. In general this is much more like a meme subreddit now, even when we are approaching the most important earnings week of the year. A good portion of the new members don't even understand the last sentence.

* this isn't WallStreetMemes, this is WallStreetBets

Anyone who's been here longer than 3 months, knows that we used to have much more useful posts or gain/loss porn in the frontpage of WSB, now it's mainly memes. It's fine to have memes here and there but most of them are just low quality karma farming memes and they get old real fast, unlike loss porn. I bet anyone who has been here longer than a year, would like to see people tattooing stupid shit, drinking piss, GUH their wife's boyfriend's savings away, and just see people act like the true autist they are, rather than these boring new memes.

&#x200B;

**How to fix this?**

1. We had the rule for not allowing posts to be in r/all for like a whole 10 minutes back in the days, and I think we need that back. If someone is a true autist, they will find their way here regardless.
2. Keep the WSB inside the WSB. No Twitter, no news, no sucking Cramer's dick to get to CNBC. We already have enough autists here to be a big player in financial markets. We don't need SEC to do us what your wife's boyfriend does to your wife.

4. WSB needs to be kept under control. True autist never attacks anyone, we just troll people, make tendies and jerk to loss porn. It's pretty simple and if you can't accept it and follow the rules, you deserve to get banned.
5. Let the new members become true autists, absorb our original culture, and I think WSB can be like it used to be. But if we constantly have a lot of new wannabe autists coming in, they are gonna take this sub over and there's nothing we can do.

Next steps for WSB and GME,0.8,"Hello there fellow degenerates, seen as we successfully shafted shitron I feel like it's time for a post to discuss this sub's true potential. A lot of us are absolute autists who scream reeeeeeee when we hear Mr Andrew 'cuckhold' (as his wife calls him) Left and order him pizzas or make tinder accounts for him (poor fucker won't be getting action any other way but please don't keep doing this). However the success of this sub is down to a couple of things:

1. How diverse the audience is, we have VC, boomer general Jim Cramer, bankers, yolo artists, lawyers, engineers, astrophysists, doctors (helo lol) and the true heros those wendy's employees who're making the major returns from diving dickfirst into every DD with  🚀🚀🚀🚀. This means we have serious power in influencing the market, not just because there are 1.9m of us, a lot of people don't follow the page and the true autists amongst us didn't just throw our student loans into GME, they got their friends to as well. So I believe as mentioned previously by some huge nerd we're probably acting as a MM when we work together.
2. Big firms know about the impact WSB has, and some of the intelligent ones will join us for the ride, more will join in the future. This means soon dumping your load into the most mentioned ticker on this sub will almost guarantee you gains.
3. GME is the first real test of whether we can turn a stock around in value mostly on our own as retail investors, because most boomers don't see any potential here, if we do get this fucker to $100+ they'll shit their pants and take notice for sure. Imagine seeing the most mentioned WSB tickers on Mad Money lol.
4. We need to continue holding GME and continue to buy MORE, this is the only way the price of GME doesn't fall to 30s, and if it gets to low 30's there's a risk of paper handed motherfuckers wiping their ass with the stock. This means that WSB will lose it's market influence and shitron can say they're right for once.
5. What most of the boomers seem to forget is that the market stays irrational for way longer than they realise. They stick to stats, which may help you get a modest return in a year but major gains are caused by irrational behaviour and logic. There's no exact science here, there'll always be a probability you'll lose due to irrational moves in the stock, what WSB has done is become that irrational move so the boomers are pissed.
6. DON'T get influenced by the paid off media, half the articles you read are sponsored by the shorts, they are shitting themselves HARD. We pushed GME up 10% even when shitron tried to make his cuckhold argument against GME. They're trying their best to manipulate the market i.e. us so that we stay poor af. Fuck. The. Boomers. They've been pouring capital into trying to convince us to paper hands but all we need is one tweet of a fucking nut by RC and the stock jumps.
7. EDIT: Having been caught up on the nightly drama, please don't post how great WSB is on social media, keep it to this reddit. If we want to make tendies for months or hopefully years to come then we've got to keep our shitposting to this subreddit, we're at a tipping point people. That being said I think it'd be quite hard to stamp us out, even if the SEC tries shutting the subreddit down, which I don't think is probable (hopefully).

The State of $GME — Diamond hands will prevail,0.95,"This is not financial advice and I can not predict the future, but my brain has developed its first wrinkle

There has been some chaos surrounding GME as most of us are well aware. Big money is under water and they are VERY mad. They're going to great lengths to manipulate WSB, other retail GME bulls and the stock itself. 

Shorts lost $800 million on Wednesday alone which means Thursdays price action put them at a loss in the Billions (these numbers come from a retard with a particularly smooth brain trying math). **They're desperate**, which is evident by Shitrons embarrassing live stream and his urgency in trying to convince people the stock is worth $20. They are trying to strike fear into investors who don't have conviction in GME to encourage them to sell and take profits.

They reek of desperation and sadness which means their positions ***probably*** expire today, Friday, Jan 22. I expect a minor sell off to start the day as the paper hands will do what they do,  **I will buy the dip**. 

This is BIGGER than the potential MOASS (which I believe will start today if enough people have true diamond hands). This here is about good vs evil, right vs wrong, David vs Goliath. I will hold every share until we reach a meme number only found on the moon and beyond. I have prepared my peanuts and look forward to our moon landing. I hope to see you there with me, WSB.

Bears are fuk - why institutional money is following Ryan Cohen [GME DD],0.97,"Yes, we do need another DD on Gamestop. I will take a look at the biggest institutional inflows and outflows into Gamestop and ~~reason myself into bullish confirmation bias~~ explain why objectively the buyers are right and the sellers are fuk.

You can also see my full DD with charts and images and emojis and shit in this PowerPoint, *yes there is a Powerpoint, DID I STUTTER?:* [*https://docdro.id/zbMjIJk*](https://docdro.id/zbMjIJk)

This DD is concerned with **institutional investments** in Gamestop. Why do we care about institutional investors?

1. They can greatly influence the price with big buy or sell orders
2. They often have longer holding periods than WSB autists. If many institutions hold Gamestop, it reduces the actively traded float and increases the probability of a short squeeze.
3. Institutional buy-in means support for the fundamental value of Gamestop and confidence in their turnaround.

**Tl;dr:** Lots of institutions IMMEDIATELY but quietly made big bets on Gamestop after Ryan Cohen made his first investment. I believe these inflows will continue as his influence on the company grows. While many institutions also exited Gamestop in the past months, due to the timing of their sales I believe these were panic sells that were made prematurely.

***Even more tl;dr:*** **🚀🚀🚀🐂🐂🐂🍆🍆🍆💦💦💦,** but you really might need to hold for quite a few months to see big gains.

This post talks about three different issues:

1. Gamestop’s situation in Summer 2020, and how Ryan Cohen swooped in to save the day.
2. How different institutions reacted to Ryan Cohen’s investment
3. Why the bullish institutions were right, and the bearish ones were wrong

**Part 1: Initial situation in summer of 2020**

Things were looking real dire for Gamestop just a couple of months ago.

[-91&#37; return in 5 years, nice](https://preview.redd.it/ejlho2zamuc61.png?width=1846&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e3d0686cb7459d56d881f43865474489f5be60b)

The price was on a consistent slide. Sentiment was absolutely terrible. A dying brick and mortar company. Going short was a sure thing. Then, Covid and retail closures. Bear thesis totally confirmed, right? Right?

In swoops Ryan Cohen and sneakily accumulates 5% of the company. We all know what happened to the share price after.

[Look at that erection](https://preview.redd.it/u5i7k2oemuc61.png?width=1517&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5a99e455105e7cd1d6cd85c12d65afbdb225e6f)

This DD is mainly concerned with institutional money flows in Q3 2020 - who bought and who sold, and what can we conclude from that?

**Part 2: How different institutions reacted in Q3**

Now sadly reporting takes a long time so we only know what movements funds made up until September 30, 2020. But that gives us a glimpse into what funds did in the same quarter in which Ryan Cohen bought in.

In that quarter, institutions ***bought*** 22m shares of Gamestop and ***sold*** 13m. A few big names were involved both in the selling and the buying.

https://preview.redd.it/62lu32fimuc61.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=234024c1e51099af1c098c4e556f6b788512e45d

""But drunkiez"", you say ""why do I care? So some institutions sold and some bought? How does this info help me go to Mars?"" Read on my child.

**Part 3: Why the bulls were right**

The relevant info here is ***timing***. If we just look at the the Top 10 funds with the biggest Gamestop inflows in Q3 2020, 7 of those opened completely ***new*** positions once they heard about Cohen's first investment. The other 3 increased their share count by ***200-900%!*** They realized immediately that the narrative would shift completely - Gamestop would no longer be seen as a dying retailer, but had a long-term chance for a new future. These guys are in it for the long haul. Companies like Morgan Stanley and Susquehanna hold their positions for an average of 20-40 quarters. The average WSB tard can't even hold for 20-40 minutes.

[Institutions are loving this turnaround story](https://preview.redd.it/jg1zasbnnuc61.png?width=1148&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf69d9a1a36ee3c4fbd55ffed3e9447c069d4079)

Now what about the poopoo bears?

We can see that many big institutions like Blackrock also exited in Q3 2020. These funds also have long holding periods. In fact, you can see in the chart below that the Top 10 bearish institutions had nearly **unchanged share holdings** since at least September 2019, and suddenly panic sold at the height of the Covid panic, right before they heard about Cohen's involvement.

&#x200B;

[The most bearish institutions bagheld for months and panic sold right before our lord came in](https://preview.redd.it/huityktkmuc61.png?width=1472&format=png&auto=webp&s=0aa909d1a28f275276f9987580a769650fc3f684)

Actually, the truth is even worse then the chart shows. Many big dick funds started making bullish bets on Gamestop even before 2019. Yes, you read that right. Blackrock made a huge bullish bet in Q2 2018, bagheld for over two years, then panic sold weeks before Ryan Cohen got in. Citigroup kept accumulating in 2018 and 2019, then suddenly sold almost the entire stake at the very bottom. D.E. Shaw went all in at the beginning of 2019, and panic sold at the bottom. They all deserve to be mods on this sub. Do you really want to follow these people with your trades?

What does this mean for the future? Sometime in February we will receive new filings on institutional purchases made in Q4 2020. I expect to see many more inflows as Ryan Cohen continued his commitment. Not to speak of Q1 2021, when he actually got operationally involved with 3 new board members. This turnaround story has only just begun.

**Bonus: why it's a good idea to trust Ryan Cohen**

A lot has been done to praise Ryan Cohen on this sub. If you want to understand why I'm bullish on anything he does, read this great DD by runningAndJumping22: [GME DD - Background and experience of new leadership](https://www.reddit.com/r/runningAndJumping22/comments/l1egkw/gme_dd_background_and_experience_of_new_leadership/)

I just want to add one point to this: building a successful startup is HARD. Out of the companies that receive funding (which in itself is really hard to do), 9 out of 10 will go on to fail. But you know what increases your chances of building a successful company to almost 100%? **If you've already done it before**. You have the money, the network and the talent to do it again. Look what the founders of Paypal later accomplished: Tesla, Affirm, SpaceX, all of Peter Thiel's successes, Palantir, Youtube, Linkedin, etc. Very different companies, every single one of them a winner.

VC funds will fall over themselves to give money to previously successful founders, because **they know they will have an almost 100% chance of succeeding again**. Ryan and his buddies have done it once, and they can do it again. It doesn't really matter to us how they do it. They could walk into any fund's office and easily collect tens of millions to start a new gaming e-commerce company. But they chose to do it with Gamestop. Not a bad idea in itself.

In my opinion, they could literally close every single store, sell all assets and use the net cash of USD 200m to build an ecommerce company from scratch (btw: Chewy, which ships 60 POUND HEAVY BAGS OF DOG FOOD only used USD 130m in capital investments while Ryan Cohen was there). But Gamestop does come with some good assets: a store base, a well-known name, partnerships, Reginald Fils Aime on the board, etc.

One hindrance is that the name Gamestop is poison on Wall Street. I know this point has been beaten to death lately, but I think it will take **several quarters of Cohen's involvement and operational changes** to truly change that, so you really shouldn't invest a ton of money if you're not willing to hold for that long. However, we can see that sentiment started changing almost immediately once Ryan Cohen got it, and I don't see that stopping anytime soon. Even without a short squeeze, this stock can go to the moon in the coming years.

Collateral value of lending shares GME and getting assignment on call options,0.68,"Hello retards,

First of all i do not want to make anyone afraid but i really think it is important to give a warning on a unlikely thing that could happen.

Today i discover my GME shares (around 4000) are lend out. I like that because i do get 10%+ (broker takes other 10% so shorts are bleeding). But i discover also that the collateral amount for those lending is not higher then 40$ at the moment. If the lender default i would not get more then the 40$ back.   
I am a bit afraid that even the big short players will bring the shorting of GME under a separately entity to protect there main business and being able to be more aggressive. They could default more easy this way and i know it most scummy thing this hedge fund can do it would not surprise me with what they do now and in the past.    


**What should happen? What can we do?**  


1. Check if your broker lend your long GME position if they do without benefit for you stop that.
2. Ask your broker with this circumstances to give more collateral  because there is more risk and swings on this stock. probably there is a ""expert"" involve who gives the ""right"" amount of collateral but i have no trust in this ""expert"" (those experts are not on our side).   


The more collateral they need to put up the better it is for us in anyway possible.

Alright Ryan Cohen,0.65,"Listen Up, Daddy. You made us a shitload of tendies, and we are forever grateful. Since SadJim already acknowledged some of us aren’t nearly as autistic as most of us are retarded, I wanted to submit a strategy play that could give $GME more fuel for 🚀 🚀 🚀 

See, most of us retards, especially the other autists over in r/gaming don’t just spend our tendies on condoms for our wives boyfriends — some of us are stupid enough to dump our tendies into dumb bullshit called *in-game transactions*. Typically, these transactions are in the pursuit of digital assets, like different colored 🌈 🐻 jumpers for your retarded characters to wear in the game. In case you autists missed it (I’m sure Daddy Cohen didn’t), I just said digital **assets**. 

Now, a smart man would take a look at this and say: “so fucking what? Who gives a shit about fake digital shit that doesn’t even exist. We like terminals with lots of big numbers, charts that go up, and green”. I’m not going to belabor the irony here.

The fact is we’re not smart men. We’re autists. And when autists see pent up value as a secondary market in gaming accounts, we see fucking tendies.

Of course Daddy Cohen has put two and two together, but I know you retards need a helping hand so here we go. Essentially, along with its increased emphasis on online game sales, $GME could also create a marketplace for gaming accounts whereby customers sell accounts for various games using valuations derived from tools $GME develops on its platform. Some tool/plug-in scans your accounts, determines the current value of your shit, and you can sell it to retards who are too lazy to amass their own dumb digital shit on their own time.

“You stupid fucking retard”, you may be saying. Yes, I know, I know. The gaming companies whom publish the games are technically the owners of those assets! Not the people who actually *paid for them*!

Well listen here motherfuckers. Daddy Cohen just bent Melvin over and fisted him after an aggressive spanking — you think he’s not ready to spend half of those tendies on a rabid team of lawyers to do the same thing to EA or Activision?

how much will it cost for shorts to cover gme?,0.95,"I started asking myself 2 questions recently: 

1-) why hasn't the SEC said anything yet about the current short interest? which leads to my second question

2-) what if there just isn't enough money for shorts to cover their position? maybe that could explain why the SEC have been silent so far... I don't know

 all you beautiful degenerates, I know a lot of you smart people are out there are looking at every little thing on GME so I have to ask this. according to shortsqueeze the last reported short interest was 71million shares; given the current pps of $43.02 how much would it cost if the shorts give up and decide to cover? let's make it easy and assume time froze and the pps doesn't budge a cent while they cover? I did my crude math, **it looks too good to be true and wouldn't want to be in their shoes**

say whatever you will about gme business, the mm deep pockets, all the strings they can pull etc but one thing is for sure is there are still **71millions shares to cover** so pls just share  the math on how much that will cost even if  (hypothetically)  there is no squeeze.

&#x200B;

>I don't really think about short ratio, etc. when looking at stocks. Think about it: what difference does it make? The fact that some shorts may cover \[if it/as it continues to go up\] is counterbalanced fairly evenly by the fact that they all think its overvalued! In my experience, stocks that are crowded shorts or have large borrow rates (or both) are often likely to decline. The question is can one take the pain. Outside of trading dynamics, my simple approach with all of investments is: what would I pay for this entire business. I would not pay $3 billion for a risky turnaround. I think the turnaround will go fine as COVID goes away and they have new management/active stockholders. Typically I really could not care less who owns a stock. All of this stuff is really silly relative to real value. Now, if you care about what price the stock will be this week or next week, perhaps it matters. But to me, I'm worried about buying a $40 stock if I think it is worth $80 or more. That's not this. I'm also interested in shorting a $40 stock if it is worth $20 or so. That's not this either. Like most stocks, it's neither here nor there, thanks to the arbitrage of the market. The smart money was buying in COVID-induced panic for retailers. The arbitrage opportunity appears over to me. Keep in mind the guys who were short at $10 are probably out and replaced by bigger meaner traders who are short at $40. It's not easily to tell who is short or what their basis is FYI/FWIW. Finally, the craziest concept, and i know some of [r/wsb](https://www.reddit.com/r/wsb/) is thinking this, is the idea that one could crowd-source a ""short squeeze"". A group of people buying a lot of stock, even 10% of it, won't really change the price much without fundamental changes. That's why short squeezes are more mythical than empirical. Usually, short-sellers exit positions because of fundamental changes. It's true SOME short sellers will exit because of price changes, but they'll usually be replaced by traders who are new to the position. For instance, I came to this situation hoping it would be a good short (and open-minded that it would be a good long). I don't think it is. One can't buy their own asset and keeping trying to sustain its price. Eventually the company has to deliver on something.

**TLDR:** GME🚀 bears r fuk

🚀🚀 🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 💎✋💎  🚀🚀 🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 💎✋💎

**The questions you should be asking...**

People have left out all the fund traded shares that are owned (likely locked into place unless it moons and they have to rebalance). You're leaving out all the synthetic shares floating out around because of the shorts, and the facts the institutions or their allies are front running those shorts likely. Citron has also ignited a fight with some funds that have a bone to pick.

You're leaving out that the shorts also ARE NOT GETTING DELIVERED. Just because a broker has the shares on their books to short does NOT mean those shares are delivered.

How do I know? [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

GameStop's been on it far too long.

But brokers don't give a fuck, because SEC doesn't give enough of a fuck to do anything about it. They also don't give a FUCK about you. They only give a fuck with someone that matters enough does something wrong enough that someone else who matters enough gets hurt. Why did Elon get charged? There were a few institutions betting against it, remember?

&#x200B;

**Questions for you**

Have you checked institutional inflow estimates? Have you checked L2 aggregated orders? Have you peeked at the bulk order flows?

Do you actually have any idea how fucked the shorts are? Because if you did, you'd second mortgage your fucking house and put it on the line (do **NOT** do this you fucking idiot, it's a figure of speech).

&#x200B;

**General thesis as of today:**

* Institutions are fighting each other, not just us
* Enough people have enemies within Wall Street, they're willing to pad their bottom lines after a year like we've had if the risk is minimal and greater for the other side (because one side has to give in first, humans can only take so much punishment)
* Citron is obviously, blatantly manipulating the stock via the methods I describe below (note, today there were shares available to be loaned, and right before his stream, there was a massive short attack and then VIOLA there were no more shares to borrow. I don't know if this is coordinated with institutions, but the fuckers only worth $5M, he doesn't have the money to do what is going on by himself. **It could easily be algorithms just picking up news** on the wire and inappropriately acting on it.
* Institutional inflows, bulk orders, and dark pools allow the type of wars we're watching (explained below)
* I think there's just general interest in the stock, the added upside is that Citron and Melvin get fucked in the process of us owning a revolutionary gaming company
* Cohen is going to change things, and hopefully he goes on Benzinga tomorrow to give commentary

🚀🚀 🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 💎✋💎  🚀🚀 🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 💎✋💎

&#x200B;

**On how the volume is behaving and what is going on likely:**

As far as institutional inflows those and bulk order flows sometimes go together. Also, some dark pools aggregate their orders so what looks like a bunch of 1000, 500, 250, 50, 90, 110 share lots when people are selling are actually a single lot of 2000 etc.

These dark pools are used as back channels for some private funds that have broker access to the street, and help to disguise institutional movements mostly for hedge funds and speculative funds.

By looking at inflow estimate reports (you have to be in the industry to get access to most of this, it comes from extremely expensive research firms that brokers pay, or they have a team in house doing it) along with bulk orders, and trying to match those to the T&S tape ticker, you can start to see perhaps who is moving what.

If someone transacts let's say, 1M shares, and you can attribute it to a single individual somehow (if the pool didn't aggregate their order into another order to mix it into the execution cycle which normally they do to try and hide it) you can get an idea of what the true tradeable float is (if you don't get why, it's because you don't buy a million shares of something to day trade it, those are sitting at home for awhile, a long while).

Those institutions buying those shares will let the price fall, then throw 50-100k of their shares through. You don't just execute a buy or sell of 1M shares @ $40, it's a thousand here, thousand there and the algo tries to get you the best price possible. Often you'll see dips, massive buy spikes, then buy/sell walls go up at price points where their average is to try and build a retail base also. Considering originally there was a low percentage of outstanding shares traded per day, building that base will take time because institutional ownership is so huge. Once that is built, they just have to counter act any shorts, and see even 50 basis point increase in volume could set this entire thing off.

Those short attacks will stop once the shorts get out of their position but the base will remain and the hunger for the shares will remain. If the short float falls a bit, it actually will help us believe it or not, because the people that are going to get fucked here aren't the institutional traders - it's the big retail whales and 9 figure individuals betting against this. The big firms are already hedged, I promise you.

With the short volume being met by institutional buying volume, I estimate the actual float to be much, much, much smaller than the numbers we're seeing. Institutional ownership is over 100% -- this is ONLY possible by buying synthetic shares that are shorted.

All of this combined shows me that we have firms going at each other. A couple retail whales come in and upset that balance of power, and we're going to see this thing rip upwards. What you're likely seeing is firms day trading calls on swings (yes, calls, not puts) and forcing those swings to help them profit some, then cover some of their shares and slowly reduce the delta of their positions. They're not trading puts because that just exaggerates their delta, they trade the calls in case the thing fucking flies to the moon, their losses are capped as it sits now, and they're likely trading portions of their share position. 10% at a time, and if they have enough capital, they can drag this fight out for a long fucking time. There's no benefit for them to unwind all at once, it could set this thing into the stratosphere. It's potentially possible many of them have various dated $20 calls to help cover their short (and by possible, I mean likely, because the algos probably hedged as soon as it saw the price/volume explode when it moved off the $20 mark and identified the possible buttfucking their short position was about to give them) and they're just slamming volume around trying to create volatility because that's the best for the people writing the options (them and their friends). For all we know, some of these shorts are completely hedged just building it up to profit off the squeeze. If the shares rip up once they get out of the position, they don't care, because they'll hold to expiration for hedge, exercise, take the gains, and tank the stock again and short it on the way down while hedging the upside again. If the stock goes down, they can dump the calls and just let their short ride back down a ways. The calls are their cap -- similar to people buying a debit spread instead of long calls.

But with Melvin's puts likely expired and not re-upped in any identifiable way, that means we know one guy is really under the heat and already way fucking down on his position, which causes desperation. Humans can only take so much. Match that up with Citron's extreme fucking failures over the course of the last two years, we got a couple guys with reputations and millions on the line.

* **When is the short squeeze going to happen?**

I have no idea when. Whenever the institutions are happy with their positions, probably.

Days to cover means shit, for every person that covers, at this point, someone else is going to take their spot because enough firms think that it's going down and they would love that because they want a better entry on the long term. Believe it or not, regardless of Credit Suisse's way off price target, there's numerous VC firms and big whales looking at this right now wondering if WSB got something right, and if they understand the industry better. Most these guys don't understand gaming, it's a new, growing industry.

The catch is that someone has to be the first one to jump, like cliff diving into water you don't know the depth of. If one firm jumps, others may join. But if they jump and are wrong, they're tied into that investment and can't be non-directional if they're making an investment based play since that would be bad to suppress price for the company they're invested in and a violation of fiduciary responsibility.

This is part of the reason that long term, we could benefit from a pullback. Let some of the assholes off the hook so the real price can be determined by the market.

* **Meta: How do I learn to be good at trading?**

Learn the market first, learn how to trade without any of the finance knowledge. This knowledge really doesn't help me trade all that much, it helps me understand why I win or lose, but knowing how to pick entries/exits and how to control my emotions is the best thing I've learned although I'm unhinged on Melvin and Citron

How I Made $2M In The Stock Market by Nicholas Darvas, then review Bill O Neill's shit with a grain of salt, don't follow CANSLIM to the T, but some of the ideas are sound like how to identify growth companies.

After that, mess around trading shares and just make a goal to profit. If you're down, analyze the position and thesis and decide if you will get a profitable spot later, if so, learn discipline and hold. If not, cut it loose and start another trade.

Do it about 50,000 times over 10,000 hours and you'll get good at it.

&#x200B;

***In Conclusion:*** If you're in the industry, you have access to shit others don't (not implying I am, or how I know these things). You should be able to watch a price/volume chart during the day and instantly identify institutional activity.

Fuck Melvin and Fuck Andrew Left and Shitron. It's one thing to be in a firm and short a stock for fundamental reasons. It's a whole other thing to let your ego get in the way after you drove the price down to $3 and go for the jugular just to make yourself feel better. The guy deserves the fucking $200-$300M loss he's about to eat at the current price, probably more considering the options he had expired and he's likely got some other hedges in place that won't work out for him.

This isn't to flex knowledge, it's to tell people you should be careful just spreading info around this board and getting people on board with a thesis. We're all mostly right on the idea that there's a squeeze coming, but it isn't for the reasons that we're saying.

GME DD: Float breakdown + MOASS speculations,0.99," This is a somewhat long read. Let’s start with the summary.

# Tldr;

* VW-like MOASS is likely to happen regardless of whether we 💎hand or not; and whether we keep stocks in cash vs margin. Pussy 🧻🖐are not going to make the squeeze any weaker but rather they will just miss out on the best part.
* The true float is not enough to cover all shorts. (not new, but detailed holding breakdown below)
* The most violent part of the squeeze is likely to happen on the last 1-2 days of the squeeze, not the beginning. 
* The end (peak) of the squeeze is not in our hands as much as it is in the hands of large institutional holders, insiders or a company offering.
* 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**Disclaimer**: I’m a simple retard trying to understand the mechanics of the market. This is not advice on what to do. If you have input your feedback is welcome.

# Float deep dive

Previous DDs suggested that the violence of the squeeze depends on the ratio between shorted shares and available shares they can buy to cover. 

I wanted to understand exactly what this ratio is like right now and going into the squeeze. The purpose of this exercise for me was to gather data available on all holdings (institutions, insiders and mutual funds) to find out exactly how much float there is.

## True float 

Before looking at the data, let’s talk about float vs true float. True float is a word I came up with to help myself understand how many shares are available for shorters to purchase.

As mentioned in previous DDs, each 1 share sold short creates another synthetic long share. This explains why the total shares in the market are larger than the number of shares issued by the company.

Thus, the true float = share float + synthetic longs from each short

= share float + short interest = \~117M

Now, let’s take a look at how much of that true float is available to trade. I’ve compiled this sheet below to break down the holdings of insiders, mutual funds and institutional holdings. Note that this doesn’t account for WSB holdings.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gg7lm3zj1uc61.png?width=3356&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8c77a8a0b8e8cecef2ad754a04029d302fc52e3

 

## Observations

* Insiders and institutional holdings alone account for more than 100% of the company issued shares. 
   * In other words, the shorts simply cannot cover their shorts from the market alone. 
   * This is what previous DD’s referred to as negative float.
*  The share/float ratio currently is roughly 2.3:1

# Why I don’t think holding in cash vs margin makes much of a difference

The premise from previous DD’s is that holding in cash accounts and not margin means shorters can no longer borrow the stocks to short further. This is absolutely correct. 

Essentially, my understanding is shorters can borrow any share from the “true float”  (including synthetic longs) to short sell it again. They can just keep shorting the stock forever pretty much if they have infinite money.

Eventually, some of those synthetic longs created by shorting will arrive in a 💎hand cash account, which reduces the amount of borrowable shares from the true float.

Thus, available to short for shorters= True float - cash account 💎hand shares.

When the shares available to short are reduced, they become hard to borrow and brokers raise borrow rates on them. This makes shorters bleed faster.

While I agree that holding in cash account makes shorters bleed faster, I don’t think it makes a difference in the eventual occurrence of the squeeze because:

1. Shorters don’t have infinite money to keep shorting it forever. 
2. I’d expect brokers would raise borrow rates regardless of borrow availability since shorting a fast climbing stock has a high risk and the stock is climbing very fast.
3. It’s obvious that the sentiment is shifting very positively in the favor of GME. Anyone trying to short it further at this point is playing with fire and risking bankruptcy.
4. Once the squeeze starts, it should get very violent. Shorting this stock during it’s squeeze sounds like suicide so I’m speculating no new shorts will be open during the squeeze until news of an offering or something comes out.

In other words, buying on margin seems equally good to me if you’re considering it. But if you can keep your shares in cash, go for it as it may bleed the shorters sooner rather than later.

# Why I think VW-like MOASS is still likely to happen even though the current short:float ratio is not like VW

The short:float ratio is not constant.

Since insiders, institutions and mutual funds hold over 100% of the float, it seems to be the case that the entirety of our shares are synthetic longs created due to shorts.

As shorts cover, synthetic long shares disappear from the market. As the true float grows smaller, the ratio between the remaining shorts needed to cover and the remaining float will change.

To imagine this, I created a chart to try to visualize what happens to the short/float ratio during the squeeze for different possibilities of days to cover.

Since it’s hard for me to predict how many shorts will cover exactly each day, I made some basic assumptions:

* Let’s assume that for D days to cover, each day will see (SI / D) shorts covered. In other words, the shorts will be covered evenly over the days to cover.
   * This probably isn’t very accurate. In reality I expect the shorts covered to start small then increase dramatically each day due to margin calls.
   * If anything, I’d imagine this means reality should be more violent than this chart.
* Let’s assume insiders and institutions will sell 20% of their holdings prior to or during the squeeze
   * 20% makes it more of a worst case scenario.
   * I see how it makes sense to think that insiders and institutional holders would want to take advantage of the situation and sell more.
   * However, if those people have anything close to even a fresh grad intern working on this, they should understand that by holding longer they are creating fortunes for themselves.
* Let’s assume no new short positions will be opened during the squeeze
   * This seems straightforward. Can you imagine someone shorting VW during its squeeze? They would be out of their mind. 
   * Even if someone is that crazy, I’d expect brokers would have skyrocketing fees.

Following the above assumptions, I created the following tables. Each table represents the outstanding SI, the available to trade float, and short:available ratio respectively.

To visualize the data above, let’s put it on a chart. Y axis is short:float ratio.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c7smltol1uc61.png?width=1717&format=png&auto=webp&s=973c78faae78a78f0e1ae64fc34a12a7e33b1b05

&#x200B;

 

Observations

1. The short:float ratio becomes somewhat exponential as time passes due to supply shortage.
   1. NOTE: It looks like the lines end early at small values. Don't fret, this simply means there are no shares available anymore after this day, aka the line tends to infinity.
2. The squeeze becomes way more violent, more violent than VW, on later days (especially past 2-3 days) for all of different hypothetical values of days to cover.
3. In all scenarios, there will become a point at which there are simply no shares available (negative) for short positions to purchase to cover.

Point (3) here is what makes this squeeze an infinity squeeze like a previous DD called it. Essentially, at this point remaining short positions are at the mercy of insiders, institutions, mutual funds or a company offering. Heck, even the offering of $100M may not be enough shares to cover the remaining short positions when the price skyrockets.

I’m just a retard trying to wrap my head around this to arrive at this observation. However it’s safe to assume all of the above entities should be completely aware of this situation and the possibility of an infinity squeeze. I don’t see why they wouldn’t want to take advantage of this situation to name their price. Institutions could sell out and make deals with Melvin and shorters but they would be acting against their self interest; I'm assuming they can just get paid by brokers even if Melvin et al. go bankrupt.

My conclusion - 

The infinity squeeze is somewhat inevitable. It may likely start small. Once it starts, it will keep getting more violent each day. If shorts start covering and the stock skyrockets, chances are it will skyrocket aggressively further each day for the next 2-3 days until institutional holdings sell or the company announces an offering which seem unlikely to start early.

Positions: \~8,000 shares, no limit orders set. Company fair value in my book is >$100 without a squeeze.

If you search for ""Carbon Capture"" in the statement (and if you retards could read) you will see how they are actually contributing to the effort and plan on focusing on this market as one of their niches within green energy as a whole. With Daddy Elon tweeting this could this be a sign of an upcoming rise in the value of $ENG?

Also adding this just for valuation and true potential, we see how they are trading at a lower multiple than the bigger guys like FCEL and PLUG [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsT3YLLVoAMp781?format=jpg&name=large). This gives ENG more upside to grow 20x to match the levels of FCEL and PLUG, which would be a stock price of $140. That sounds outrageous and I'd aim for a lower target of around $20 for the short term until we really see traction and news on the company pick up.

GME: MOASS STAGE 2,0.97,"We have entered stage 2 of the short squeeze. Brief overview of market conditions below.


1. Corrected. Shorts are losing approx 24,000,000.00 to 40,600,000.00 in interest for every dollar increase in GME stock value 

2. Last report I saw 95k shares are available to short, down from 1.2 million last week (based on IKBR)

3. Last report I saw 71 million in short interest

4. Positive media attention on GME due to short busting

5. Upward trend through the 1.2 million short seasawing over 1 week

6. Current price is $46 USD in after hours


Effects.
- At a loss of 24,000,000.00 to 40,600,000.00 per dollar increase in interest for a day in short positions all shorts are bleeding money

- 95k shares available for shorting down from 1.2 million means the shorts can't seasaw, based on IKBR

- more media outlets are showing positive news for GME so more people are jumping in than before

- at spot price it would cost 3.2 billion to cover all shorts


My thoughts
With current estimations of 6 days to cover the short interest when a short squeeze takes off i dont see hedge funds covering this without being margin called; they've all found religion and are praying for a hard market correction to cover and exit. I'm pretty sure alot of them are going to have to liquidate most or all holdings to cover if margin called.

That being said I expect this stock take off now on the basis that short selling doesn't work, they were seasawing 1.2 million to try to push the price down, and they've maxed out. This stock is not going back down unless a catastrophe happens and even so the stock might be suppressed for a day if that due to the limited shares moving around.

Expect huge volatility with an only upwards trajectory due to 💎 ✋ s. 

I'm hoping for a margin call myself and to be blunt I'm going to try to sell my shares at a million a piece.


The size of the short interest and limited supply of shares in circulation leads me to believe that estimates that this is only going to 5x or 10x is way off. VW short interest was 12.8% and GME is over 100%. Hedge funds lost $30 billion covering just 12.8%. What do you think 100% covering with an estimated 6 days to cover based on stock circulation will look like.

This is going to make head lines when the short squeeze starts snowballing. And I honestly believe its now that it starts. Theres no downward pressure.

"Don't worry about GME, their revenue is about to see exponential growth in an unexpected way.🎉💸🚀🚀🚀",0.89,"I will not get into the short interest or any of the technicals. I will however go into a source of revenue people have been overlooking ever since Gamestop has been talking about using their stores as a base to host tournaments, which will explain why I believe GME is a long term hold. **AD REVENUE, CORPORATE AND GOVERNMENT SPONSORS, PLATFORM SPONSORS, CONSOLE SPONSORS, DATA COLLECTION**🚀🚀🚀

Back in February 2020, it was estimated that  by 2022 the global video game market is expected to [surpass $190 billion in revenues](https://newzoo.com/insights/trend-reports/newzoo-global-esports-market-report-2019-light-version/), with esports revenue expected to grow by 1.79b by 2022. [Here is an interesting link into how esports makes money.](https://www.roundhillinvestments.com/research/esports/how-do-esports-teams-make-money)🚀🚀🚀

With Esports viewership expected to grow at a 9% compounding rate through 2023, ad revenue should pick up faster than anywhere else(think cable cutters). Online gaming in Asia is already huge and different companies even have their own gaming channels for cable networks([explanation of the gaming industry in Korea](https://seoulz.com/esports-in-korea-a-complete-breakdown-of-the-korean-gaming-culture/)). [ad revenue of 844m in America alone](https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/esports-gaming-sponsorship-advertising-spend-2020-streaming-twitch)🚀🚀🚀

By getting into the esports community, Gamestop can both expand their client base(big opportunity in Asia where they love anything American) and have continuous revenue from those clients through ads, data collection, sales on food/drinks, pc parts sales, game sales, and additional revenue from sponsors as more and more companies will want exposure to their esports platform([Bussiness Insider on 2021 esports outlook](https://www.businessinsider.com/esports-ecosystem-market-report)).🚀🚀🚀

As esports gains popularity, Gamestop has a chance to profit from potential console wars. Not only Xbox vs Playstation, but through AMD vs NVIDIA, or ASUS VS LENOVO vs Intel.  By supporting all of the platforms and having the parts people may want for their custom computers based on the specs of their favorite gamer, they can propel their own revenue to new heights. The better technology gets, the more revenue Gamestop can generatebecause people will want the top of the line gaming consoles for gaming and/or trading stocks(gme shareholders). Gamestop will be able to provide the parts and labor in store, as well as advertisement for those parts through their esports teams.🚀🚀🚀

TLDR: buy shares and consider this a long term hold. Catalysts are on the way that will send short sellers scrambling for your used condom to impregnate their wife. 🚀🚀🚀.

IN STORE EXPERIENCES GME WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN?,0.88,"First of all I'm in. I get the vision and I'm not getting off the   🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🥜🥜🥜🥜🥜🙌💎 .   


However, I'm interested in the variety of experiences others are currently having in store. I saw u/blueteambluz post suggesting we all go buy something. So I went to my local small town GME. As the only potential customer in the store I tried multiple times over the course of about 10-12 mins to strike up a conversation with the clerk. I wanted them to at least get involved enough to ask a question or two that might direct how I would spend money in the store. No dice. Absolutely no interaction at all beyond single word answers and an initial hello as I came in the door. So I left without a purchase.   


The reality is this is largely what I expected. There is a reason lots of people see GME as a dying entity. These small markets with clerks that have zero incentive and minimal traffic are going to struggle. I've managed in this type of retail space and it's ALWAYS an issue. It's on those local store managers to be diligent and creative and in most cases they aren't dealing with much incentive either. This isn't something they (everyone from the local store manager to Cohen himself) aren't aware of I'm sure.

I plan to revisit in small hopes that this was a single clerk issue. I do not however expect that to be the case. At least in my experience this starts with the store manager who quite likely runs multiple locations and has a bonus structure that does nothing to give them an incentive to be all in for GME. Retail spaces are tough. Which is why the vision going forward is so important. There's still meat on the bone if someone gives a shit but the 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀's are in the revamp/pivot.   


On the plus side the store looked much better than the last time I was in some time ago. It's been a couple of years at least since I had been in. The space was less cluttered but could use a little more TLC, had less dead displays, lighting was better, and generally seemed to have been at least partially revamped. The PC space was a significant change from my previous visit. I'm primarily a PC gamer and in the past there was virtually nothing in the store for me. It's still lacking to a large degree but I was pleased to see VR equipment etc. Now if they can find people capable of selling it to me.....  


TL:DR- My local store needs training/someone to buy in or an extreme pivot if it's going to survive. What are you seeing? Cheers!",2021-01-22 00:43:30
Anecdotal DD GME from a GenX with teen boys and I hate big box stores,0.98,"Listens you young regards. I will do anything possible to buy something I want now without going to a big box store. Mainly because I hate everything about them...people, infant and toddler kids, walking a mile through the store, waiting 20 minutes to checkout, the shakedown at the door and the fucking disaster of the giant parking lots...

When my kids want a game, or for me, we go on https://www.gamestop.com web, find where the game is available and go get it. There aren't any in the dead boomer malls close by, they are all in anchor strip malls. They are where your local grocery store is. In and out of the store in a few minutes unless we browse. There are no hard pressure sales but you guys know that. We also now own the game and they can take it to their mom's, grandparents, where ever without moving the console. I easily spend $600 a year there.

Point is, I'll be utilizing this business model as long as it's available and I'm sure there are many other GenX parents that will do as well.

Playing a role of silent assassin is the best tactic that WSB possesses and it should not be dismissed,0.98,"**TLDR**: as you can see, based on what is happening now within this subreddit and publicly, sadly we are already being recognized as a single notion - radio silence for a couple of days, diamond handing/ignoring outside noise, removing your voices from youtube, twitter, other news portals is HIGHLY advised - **STOP mentioning WSB outside this subreddit - you and I, we are falling into a coordinated trap.**

To begin with, I am truly impressed with all the hard-work you guys put in whilst creating quality memes, due diligence posts, twitter messages and online presence.

But all being said, in the past couple of days we can notice the mentioning of /r/wallstreetbets come up in various ways within the social media - like twitter and benzinga, CNBC, youtube. The fact that we created a twitter account and collectively try and display our voice as an individual plays a huge downside to us. Now we are one, now we are acting as an institution, as a fund, as a united society - keep in mind guys that these notions are easily manipulated in the social media and it is way easier to target a single unified voice than it is to target a bunch of random individuals. When it comes to our beloved stocks like $BB, $PLTR, $GME it is important to highlight the fact of our **individual purchases**, **individual subscriptions** to their services, individual DDs and so much more. By silently increasing our positions as separate human beings, by silently promoting companies we are able to dish out more fire power which cannot be harassed online as we are under a cloak of shadow.

Pardon my broken English, but I hope you get the notch - WSB should not be a team or a gang - it should be all different individuals just sharing the same vision. **We must not respond to online media callouts**, we must not pay too much attention to news portals and videos calling us out. It only gives a negative outcome and makes us more vulnerable, thus allowing bears and other dipshit analysts to use WSB against their own stocks - detract other individuals/entities that may be interested in the stock by displaying us as a gang of monkeys.

I hope this message reaches some of you out, I have seen similar messages already hanging, but wanted to share my voice and remind you all - **we achieved such astounding results by acting separately** and based on a solid DD, **not by acting as a single unit**. Thank you and god bless this community.

**EDIT**: a very nice way to put it is to compare us to a beehive. It is way easier to eliminate a whole group of bees when they are in a single unit, however it is way more difficult to act against bees that are roaming free within the nature and may sting from various angles. **The unseen weapon is the deadliest.**",2021-01-22 00:06:08

Shitty Luck: My refutation of every point Shitron made in his video,0.97,"When I saw the video I was in shock, I could not believe how bad the 5 points where. So I've taken it upon myself to deconstruct / refute every point Left has made so far

**Intro**:

* ***""Never seen people so angry about showing the other side of a trade""*** We are not the angry mob you paint us out to be. Look at any WSB thread. 95% of users are willing to answer questions no matter how much of a noob. Look at the GME mega thread. No one is angry at anything except the misinformation and manipulation that you spew. We won't stand for that. But we don't spread hatred like you boomers do
* ***""Bunch of frogs in a pot of boiling water""*** We may be autistic but the thing is, we're winning. Whether it's TSLA/EVs, GME, SHOP, Becky stocks, Covid-stocks, SPACs, or Chinese stocks, we've been right. This sub has been FULL of incredible DD among all the retardation. We. Make. Money

**Five Points:**

**1) No short squeeze**

* ***""People believe we are in the middle of a short squeeze""*** But that ISN't what we believe. We believe we haven't squeezed yet. There's been plenty of DD on this thread and we've all seen the [Marketwatch article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-soars-60-in-apparent-short-squeeze-11610559366) about how there hasn't been a squeeze yet. The GME megathread LITERALLY is about holding through the squeeze, not that it is currently happening
* \*""\****As long as shorts can borrow for a fairly decent rate and insiders are selling, there won't be a squeeze""*** First addressing ""as long as they can borrow"" -  that's just it, [there's really not a lot of shares left to be borrowed.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) As for ""a fairly decent rate"", if anyone in their right mind truly believes 20%-50% interest is a good rate, I'd love to loan you some money. ""Insiders are selling"" you mean to tell me that [the meager \~900k shares sold by insiders in Jan 2021](http://openinsider.com/search?q=gme) is enough to support \~70m shares short??
* ***""you won't change the story or underlying fundamentals""*** This might be one of the absolute dumbest, mouth-breathing points in the entire video. **THE ENTIRE STORY HAS CHANGED WITH RC AND SQUAD TAKING BOARD SEATS**. There is NO question about it. Sure, when it was only a letter sent to mgt., or even when it was only just buying more shares, you could argue the story won't change. **The board of directors has fundamentally changed and it will be led by Ryan Cohen**.

**2) Numbers don't lie, people lie**

* ***""Gamestop was down 9% YOY / The current business is drowning""*** [Gamestop crushed holiday sales](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results).  **Total comparable store sales** increased 4.8% compared to last year and reflected a 29.6 percentage point sequential improvement from the third quarter of fiscal 2020.  **E-Commerce sales**, which are included in comparable store sales, **rose 309% and represented approximately 34% of total company sales**, with total worldwide E-Commerce sales year to date reaching over $1.35 billion, far exceeding the Company’s $1.0 billion growth objective

**3) Valuations Matter**

* ***""GaMeStOp iS TrAdInG At A 40x eV/EbItDA vAlUaTiOn""*** This one really showed the the immaturity of his thesis. With the addition of RC and a turnaround-thesis, **Gamestop is becoming a growth company and growth companies are not valued on an EBITDA basis.** In fact, GME at it's current price is MUCH more like a venture play than a walmart. **Venture capital values on a Revenue multiple basis and it is not uncommon to pay 10x or more of Revenue.** Gamestop is currently trading at only **0.5x revenue.** [It is truly a matter of ""buy at any price right now and hold""](https://a16z.com/2020/08/17/role-of-entry-multiples-in-valuations/)

**4) Know who is on the other side**

* **""*****\[Melvin\] is one of the top consumer discretionary funds in the world***\*\*""\*\* I don't even know where to begin with this. Melvin's short position **is already fucked without question** and it's just a matter of how badly. This point reminded me of a boomer pulling out his business card to feel important. Melvin's name and brand won't help them out of the position they are in now.
* ***""Longs are people who are ordering pizza to my house and trying to hack my twitter""*** Just want to say I fucking LOL'd so hard at this. Clearly this has nothing to do with GME but I just want to say how proud I am of WSB and our autists.
* ***""Ryan Cohen is long at $9 which makes him a smart man""*** [Another lie. RC was buying all the way up to $16 fucking dollars](https://twitter.com/CVCResearch/status/1341031224056246276/photo/1)

**5) The Company is your enemy and will offer shares**

* ***""GameStop has $1b in debt""*** Again, another lie.

[$244.5m of current debt and $216m of long-term debt](https://preview.redd.it/fphqf0xcorc61.png?width=1193&format=png&auto=webp&s=664c5e7c96d2f68078edbbc6e7ad858ab49a33af)

Final note - the video really made me feel proud of this sub. To see a man so salty that he is losing to a bunch of autists and scrambling so hard, yet failing, to find something of substance felt like ultimate vindication

&#x200B;

TLDR: As expected, everything Shitron had to say was complete BS. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Hold your shares and see you motherfuckers in Valhalla

Thursday EOD GME Gamma and OI Update,0.89,"**TLDR: GME gamma remains elevated. Estimates: $10 price increase forces about 12m shares bought by dealers; $10 price decrease forces 23m shares sold by dealers. Not necessarily bullish or bearish. Expect vol around 39/40 price range. Slight expirations tomorrow that will pressure the stock down about 1-2%, so buying or selling pressure can send it up or down, it's just 'naturally' going down 1-2% with no net buy or sell.**

I'm attempting to provide this with no bullish or bearish read. As last week, I'm bearish and have a slight put position, which has been a real loser this week, go bulls, and most of all go thetagang.

But this analysis is intended to be neutral, and I leave it to you to interpret, and there are legitimate bullish or bearish reads out of the raw data here.

Like prior posts, GME has so many options on it that the behaviors of option dealers/ market makers are significant if price moves by creating clusters of short gamma on their books.

This assumes that dealers are pretty short options (meaning, they sold them to you guys).

When there are a lot of short options at a strike, much like a bunch of matter in one place creates a gravity well that makes things move faster through it, a concentration of you degenerates has similar impact on stock price movements. The quanta of those field interactions is the Degeneron, which will hopefully be on investopedia soon. If you get too much in one place, it creates a singularity (degenerity) in which price and volume are swapped, red becomes green and green becomes red, and a new wormhole is created into a new universe in which celery sticks replace tendies, and r/investing advocates YOLO investing because it's suddenly wholesome and responsible.

Explained more directly, huge gamma concentrations create a price movement acceleration because dealers have to sell stock when price falls, and buy stock as price rises, to be fully hedged on their short options and not lose money. And they almost never lose money.

Here's the current state of things:

[https://imgur.com/a/VX5b0mv](https://imgur.com/a/VX5b0mv)

Right now, if we were to go up $10 from here, dealers would also have to buy about 12 million GME shares, assuming about 80% of all options are net short on the dealer, which should be about right with how much speculation is going on.

Using similar assumptions, if we were to go down  $10 from here, dealers would need to sell about 23 million shares. If you want to equalize on % terms, I guess trim that down to 18 or 19, but those are equal money amounts naively.

This is kind of asymmetric and oversells the down ramp though because most of the gamma ramp is very near at 39/40, which means you can expect a rapid price movement down if it gets near 41 with momentum, but would slow down somewhat after passing 38.5 or so.

This is because gamma ramp remains largest at 39/40. It is also significant at 45. There's a more equally distributed ramp in the territory under 40. But most of the ramp is that 40/39 that we passed over today, and that drove a lot of the price action today.

There are gammas at 60 and 30, and they are significant (would describe as medium), but they are far away.

Remember, gamma only matters if the buying or selling gets you near the price range. And gamma ramps only matter if large. On virtually all stocks, it is not large. It is large on GME, and sometimes other WSB stocks, particularly smaller cap ones.

In terms of open interest expiring this week (also in that link), it's a lot less than last week, about 3.1m shares of exposure of in the money calls. Compared to last weeks 10% down movement, you'd expect only a few % of pressure from this tomorrow, and that starts to fade if price goes down, so I would SWAG it at 1-2% of downwards pressure from option rolls/sells that are obligatory on friday.

**Edit Friday 11:45 est - looks like dealers did buy those shares 12m shares and we are past the gamma ramp. Given 35m volume they account for the vast majority of net buying.This means further buying is a far heavier lift, about 2x the buying force already applied today to get to 55. Would be surprised to see a lot of movement up from here though as always depends on how much new capital is attracted by the momentum. It also means you can expect downwards price pressure through end of day today as weeklies in the money get offloaded and rolled or monetized. This now means upwards ramp is minimal in the order of about 1-2m million shares to 56 then another few million at 60 and nothing beyond, and downwards gamma ramp remains all the way down to 20, though heaviest at 38/40**",2021-01-21 22:59:07

In other big tech moves, FB closed up 2% to $272 as Evercore ups their PT from $320 to $355; AMZN trimmed their earlier morning gains but still closed the day up 1.34% to $3,300; finally, after running up 6% yesterday, GOOGL retreated from a morning high that almost touched ATH to close the day at 0.22%.

* GME euphoria roars along unabated as WSB continues to go all-in on the gaming retailer. With intraday moves of over 13%, GME is as volatile as ever. Shares initially traded red in the morning but soon rally to as high as $42 when it became apparent Citron's video was postponed yet again (damn hAxOr!), but the stock soon went red once the video was uploaded. Suffice to say, Citron's video on YouTube immediately accumulated thousands of dislikes while not revealing anything material that the market wouldn't know about already - and shares recovered after an initial dive. Through the rest of the day, shares bounced from low $40s to the ~$42 sell wall, but eventually broke through during power hour and closed the day up 9.99% to $43 - a relatively strong bullish close considering GME hasn't closed above $40+ since last week's big pump. Support appears to be around $35-$37 and resistance is around $42-$43.

* Morning numbers had jobless claims falling slightly by 26k to 900k for the week ending in Jan 16 with consensus being 910k. Housing Starts saw another strong month with a 5.8% increase to 1.67m in Dec. Finally, Philly Fed manufacturing index showed a strong uptick with numbers at 26.5 vs the consensus of 12, representing an 11-month high. 

* Airlines took a beating today with UAL leading the charge. With steeper than expected rev miss from their ER, UAL closed the day down -5.7% to $42.69. DAL closed down -2.28%, JBLU -2.37%, LUV -0.91%, and AAL closed down -2.10%.

* In an unexpected move, INTC released their earnings early before the market closed and the stock traded with strength to close the day up 6.46% to $62.46. After digesting the numbers, shares retreated in AH to a current -3% to around $60. INTC reports Q4 EPS of $1.52 while consensus was $1.10 (hence the pump minutes before close) and they also projected Q1 EPS of $1.10 while consensus is at $0.93. The blue-chip semiconductor company is also upping its quarterly cash dividend by 5% (boomers love their dividend). The sector performed well today with AMD up 3% and NVDA up 3.75%. As with before, AMD's AH is a reverse of INTC with Su Bae showing boomer INTC what's up. AMD is up another 2.8% AH to $94.10.

* IBM took a heavy beating, with AH currently at -6.4% to $123 as the large IT company reports fell short of the street's expectation. While adjusted Q4 EPS was $2.07 beating the consensus of $1.79, revenue was $20.37 bil vs $20.67 expected. Especially troubling was IBM's cloud segment, producing 6.84 bil instead of the consensus of 7.18 bil.

* In WSB meme stock land BB traded red for most of the day but edged out a flat close to 0.47% to $12.85 (though it is retreating again in AH as of writing at -1.87%). ICLN closed up 4.41% to $32.66, filling the gap from last Friday's sell-off. Meanwhile, MT continues being pressured and closed the day at -1.49% to $23.

* More notable ER movers: STX reported ER and while numbers were decent, shares are retreating AH to -4.83%. WDC follows suit AH to -2.45%. TAL, the Chinese after school online learning platform, rocketed up 15% for the day after reporting a strong quarter. Shares of other Chinese ADRs in the sector also performed strongly with GSX (a Citron short) up 11.62% and EDU up 6.95% for the day.

* The DOW closed down 0.04% or -12 pts, Nasdaq up 0.55% or 73 pts, SPX up 0.03% or 1 pt (look at all those gains), and RUT close down -0.89% or -19 pts.

* Notable numbers tomorrow: PMI at 9:45 AM ET with existing home sales soon to follow at 10 AM ET.

My peepee whenever I see GME 🚀,1.0,,2021-01-21 22:50:34
A detailed breakdown of the GME Shitron video with answers.,0.97,"Edit: link to video...https://youtu.be/mEi2axM4hwI

SOME of what he said was technically accurate...but those things can be countered with little effort.

1. There is no short squeeze and shares are cheap to borrow!

Really?  Then why is there still negative float?  Why the bombardment of negative media coverage, including your tweet timed just as momentum was trending towards the $50 mark Tuesday? Why the flood of brand new user accounts on financial social media sites relentlessly bashing the stock? And a borrow rate of 30%? Doesn't seem very fucking cheap to me.

2. Numbers don't lie, people lie.

Yes fuck taco, you've lied many times to create a panic scenario in order to make money off of put options...thank you for pointing that out.  I'm sure the SEC will be bending you over eventually this year....AGAIN.

Sales being down for console launch was a result of two primary things: bot purchases sucking inventory availability, and the fact that 75% of the malls across the country were at required limited capacities with less average traffic than 20 fucking years ago due to covid.  Hard to sell things out of a store that can't be open.

3. Valuation matters.  

Yes it does.  All future projected earnings were based off of the EXISTING antiquated business model.  It is fairly clear at this point after Cohen's letter to the board in November that the company will no longer be following this business model AT ALL. While we don't have the particulars of the plan yet, we do know that Cohen, his COO, CFO, CMO built an e-commerce from scratch with a little over 100 million funding and turned it in to a business  that within four years had a 20x revenue multiple and made Jeff fucking Bezos back down from competing aggressively against it.

4. Know who's on the other side of the trade.

Here he implies that all the people buying the stock are dipshits that deliver his fat ass Pizza, while the douchebags running Melvin Capital are the smartest guys around.  What he fails to acknowledge is that individually we might be dumb as rocks, collectively we have unending resources for due diligence, and by now have clearly laid out the underlying true value potential far better then the hedgies who's due diligence has amounted to ""short into oblivion cuz it's Blockbuster 2.0, end of story."" not acknowledging the fact that there's greater odds they've just been complacent thinking that no one would notice they over leveraged themselves on what they just assumed was a sure bet.  He also implies that Ryan Cohen would just take the money and run as if this was a fucking swing trade for him.  It's not only an insult to his intent and vision, but it's an insult to our faith in his character.

5. Your company can become your biggest enemy ie. an offering to raise cash and dilute stock value.

You think we give a fuck if they throw out an at the market shelf offer when this hits $300 after we bankrupt fuckers like you?  The diamond hands in this legion are not going to get salty if they lose a quarter or half of their profits after being up 500%.  It is something that they should actually do...but if they've paid attention at all to what's going on (how could they not?) they know that we're on the precipice of a uncontrollable skyrocket of share price that they can take advantage of.  You think they're going to settle for $40? Think again dipshit.  SIDE NOTE: please don't buy at 300 okay retards?

Buzzkill opinion: GME is going to body slam half this sub into the center of the earth,0.48,"I do not have a crystal ball, I really think it is just as likely that we see GME 60 next week as it is we see GME 20.  But having been a lurker and mild participant in this community for a long time now, I can tell you that there is a universal law around here: for every legendary gain porn, there is equal and opposite loss porn. 

All I ask is that you be safe out there my fellow tards. For the vast majority of us, this is just fun and games, and it is probably best to not try to make it more than that - but if you do, you should think very carefully about the elements at play when you choose to load thousands of dollars into a stock that has already gone on a legendary bull run and has entered pretty heavy supply zone.

Shitron’s 5 🌈🐻 reasons to short GME.,0.95,,2021-01-21 21:06:24
"Frere retards, greetings from the theta gangbang. Here's how to play GME options 💎👐🚀💩🍋🌚",0.95,"I'm going to use the shortest possible words and only a lil bit of maths required.

1. GME is volatile af, because there are actually thousands of people just as dumb as 💩🍋Andrew Left, or they're trapped in their shorts and need GME to go down.


2. Volatility means options are outrageously expensive. You pay out the ass for the time that the option is good for. Don't do that, bad, bad!


2. If we just hold and ride-or-buy any dips, we're going to the 🌚🚀🚀


3. Read this part really slowly: you. can. sell. options. That means you sell time and make 💲💲 every second that nothing happens.


4. You can sell calls or puts. Selling calls is bad because (a) you either own the stock and miss the 🚀(because the shares will get ""called away"" by whoever brought the calls from you, or (b) you don't own the stock have to buy it at the moon price to hand over the shares to the call buyer. 


5. Selling puts is good because (a) if GME stays high, you get all the juicy premium, which you can use to buy more shares, or (b) if it goes down and you get assigned, you are getting a better price because the price you pay is the ""strike"" MINUS THE PREMIUM.


EXAMPLE: today I ""sold to open"" some puts with a strike of 40, getting about $200 for each contract. I needed 3,800 in my account to ""secure"" each contract (100 shares at the strike - minus the premium). What it amounts to is a 5% gain in 24 hours. Worst case scenario is I am assigned shares at a ""cost basis"" of $38, which is just dandy to me.

So go forth and pillage more sweet tendies from the bastard 🩳🩳🩳🩳. Buy shares, SELL puts. This is our time and no one is going to take it from us!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Edit:
Good positions:

40 strike, 1/22 (tomorrow), $70 right now (this is what I'm holding)


42 strike, 1/22, $140 premium right now


40 strike, 1/29, $340 premium (8.5% gain in like a week)

Edit 2: Jesus, you guys. You don't have to own any shares to do this. It's a totally separate transaction that can't affect the shares you already own",2021-01-21 21:05:56

Psychological Meme Analysis of the Alchemical Symbolism behind WSB (and the GME event).,0.96,"I love this community. Your self-aware ""retarded"" humor is very powerful and I see a future where people with such a personality will be important. Anyways, haven't seen any psychoanalysis of the GME event, so I thought I would give it a try!

&nbsp;

**It's about control.** It's not about the money, as some of you have pointed out (jokingly, but jokes are always funny because they’re true), but it’s about control, specifically, individual control. Power to the little man.

&nbsp;

For centuries, if not millenia, the individual person was deemed useless and holding no power over the world. But this control is finally in your (diamond) hands. The diamond vs paper hands meme may look random, because ""diamond hard"" and ""paper soft"", no further meaning into it, but when you deal with memes, especially ones that work so well, things are rarely random and have an underlying symbollic meaning. 


Let's look deeper, through an alchemical perspective, let's compare the structure of the diamond and paper: 

 - Paper is made of numerous individual microscopic fibers, all tangeld chaoticly together to create a piece of paper. Obviously, one fiber is useless on its own, but ""together they strong"". That story, of the power of the collective, has been told for centuries (and still continues to this day). And thus all the power and influence was directed and “put in the (paper) hands” of government or deities (through law and religious texts, written on “paper”). 

 - But we're seeing something happen, a shift. Paper (and thus the power of the collective) is weak. Paper hands are weak. While the diamond, which is basically one big individual molecule (and in that way symbolising the individual being) is strong. Diamond hands are strong. Hands themselves symbolise control, since that's how we interact with the world and make changes- through our hands. We're putting power in the hands of the individual (diamond hands), while we deem the age-old story of the power of the big collective weak (paper hands).

&nbsp;

And what do ""diamond hands"" do? They HOLD. They hold this idea to be true. They hold to make it true. They hold the power and do not let go of it, are not influenced by the price of the stock (in other words, not influenced by other people). They can not be touched by anything from the outside world and stay whole as an individual, and merely by believing that they are the ones in control, that ""stonks only go up"", they do.


This is why the meme ""wsb is atrology for men"" works, or why you are so retarded and autistic, because that's what you are. We have no other word for it. Believing that a stock will go up, because of memes or random signs from the universe, or just because you believe that it will go up is retarded in our society, only retards do that. But that's because the way you are processing the world is a new way of thinking, one that has yet go mainstream and to conquer the world. That's why you take retard and autist as a compliment. Because only an autist thinks that the little man holds any power, but you believe that will all your heart and want it to be true with all of your being.

&nbsp;

Each one of us here is that little man and not only the whole sub, but the whole world is waiting to see the result of this experiment, which will prove once and for all if the little man, the individual HOLDS any power. And I think you already know the result of that experiment. You know the result, because... you, individually, are, indeed, in control of the world and exert as much influence as any ""politician"", ""deity"", ""collective"", ""CEO"", ""Melvin"", ""Gay Bears"" or whatever else people like to give up their personal power to by merely thinking that these people are in control and HOLD all the power. They're not. You are the one HOLDING it. And you are going to prove that to yourself and to everyone who doubts that with GME.

&nbsp;

When you say that ""we're making history"", you are literally creating it, not only participating in it, don't forget that, don't forget to ""diamond hand"" this and ""HOLD""!",2021-01-21 20:41:30

Citron GME Review - Do not Buy the Bullshit,0.95,"Andy Left posted his 5 reasons that this will fail. 

The main thesis of his position was based primarily off the fact that they're a retailer.

This idiot is thinking so far ahead that hes left his logical thinking behind. GME is currently entering a retrenchment and possibly a divestiture. This does not mean it will fail. It means they are readjusting their priorities and shifting their business model. 

Do not be scared. Do not buy into this bullshit. Name recognition and branding are incredibly important in this world. Gamestop has real options and opportunities - Gaming is still in its infancy. There are a plethora of future positions GME will capitalize on. 

This /IS NOT/ Blockbuster. 

&#x200B;

tl;dr - buy the dips - what this video did was show how little these people know about gaming. It shows how little imagination they have. It shows how little forward thinking is placed into their thought process. Most importantly - it shows how incompetent money managers can be.

"Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD): Why the gay bears 🌈🐻 are pushing it",0.91,"I have seen a ton of great inspirational posts on holding💎🙌, but I havn’t seen any threads that concisely explain why FUD is everywhere right now. So here’s a guide to holding your bag:

TLDR: Shitron, Melvin, and the Big Shorters (BS) are pushing fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) to keep the price of GME low and substitute boomer risk in place of their own money. The path forward is hold, buy, and push back against FUD for tendies 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Positions: 1150 GME shares @ 38.16 avg

We’ve all seen the mountain of hit pieces in the previous days – Shitron being the worst offender. These pieces serve 3 purposes:

1) they induce fear in the paper hands 📝🙌 among us – “maybe this really is the peak, nobody went broke with 30% gains”. This lets the BS off of the hook for far too low of a price.


2) making boomers the bagholders. i.e. If a correction down is certain, only an idiot would throw away money by NOT shorting the stock 🌈🐻. This creates a synthetic share that they can use to escape their position at current prices.
If the past few years have taught us anything it is that if an untrue position is said loud enough and often enough a huge portion of the viewers will come to believe that statement. 


3) Building the narrative that they are the victims here. 
This is longer term than even the result of what happens financially with GME. There will be a well-funded effort to paint the picture that the entire market was exploited by a group of organized retail investors who found a money hack. This downplays that GME IS a value trade and we are all disparate traders who saw it for what it is worth and might become.
This is important because this narrative gives them a lever to lobby for regulation changes in their favor and avoid client accountability (“We didn’t make a bad trade, we were robbed by those tendie-loving morons at WSB!”.)


The BS must exit the position as soon as possible without blowing up the stock price. Every day that the long dong bulls💎🙌🐂 hold and buy costs them millions of dollars in interest on shares. If boomer retail investors become aware of how good of a deal GME shares are (go read someone else’s DD) and go long🚀🚀🚀 rather than short the price will moon🌑, interest will increase, they will be forced to cover at insane prices, and there will be nobody in the way of massive losses. The only way out for melvin and the BS is to manipulate the market in such a way as to escape consequences for putting themselves in a dangerous position.

GME GANG READ UP! TA analysis to help you to DIAMOND HAND this to infinity and beyond! We're ALMOST there!!!,0.96,"Preface: I've studied TA for 10 minutes on YouTube so obviously I know what I'm talking about. For all you tards who don't even know what support / resistance is, firstly, glad you're still alive, dunno how you've made it this far. Here are the definitions I copy and pasted.

https://preview.redd.it/3dn23so4pqc61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d001aa763ecd12b356ba29d4027793e3717275c

A **support level** is a level where the price tends to find support as it falls. This means that the price is more likely to ""bounce"" off this level rather than break through it. However, once the price has breached this level, by an amount exceeding some noise, it is likely to continue falling until meeting another support level.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_and_resistance#cite_note-DailyFX1-2)

A **resistance level** is the opposite of a support level. It is where the price tends to find resistance as it rises. Again, this means that the price is more likely to ""bounce"" off this level rather than break through it. However, once the price has breached this level, by an amount exceeding some noise, it is likely to continue rising until meeting another resistance level.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Now if you take a look at the price action over the past 2 days, you can see some key supports / resistances.

We seem to have a support at around the $36.76 mark, which means the price will have a tough time falling below this. Translation: Can't go tits up if you bought under $36.

Also, you can see there seems to be a 2nd support growing at the $40 mark. We can make this into a solid support if you PAPER HANDED MOTHERFUCKERS stop selling at $40 and instead RELOAD UP at $40.

Next, we see there is a resistance at about $42.37, and this is where the current battle is being fought right now. Who knows what will happen, if we all do our part, we can win this battle and see the prices stay steady above not only $40, but $42.37

Lastly, there is a ""no man's land: at past $44.71. If we manage to break this resistance level, all hell will break loose. The shorts will shit their pants and panic cover their shorts some more. Maybe they'll try and fire off some more bullshit articles too, who knows.

But one thing is for sure, the shorts are slowly running out of oxygen.

TL;DR = BUY THE DIPS at $40 and HOLD.

"🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 BIG YOLO on $VST (Vistra Corp), 140 000K USD, ALL LEVERAGED.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",0.76,"First here's the story,

27 years old retard. Kinda new to this place, started looking into WSB and stocks around July 2020. This is my first big YOLO here. Total portfolio invested 378k. 198k of that amount is leveraged. I found $VST by accident while browsing undervalued stocks on simply wall street and the clean energy thingy caught my eye.

My total stake in $VST amounts to 140 000$ so basically all of it and more is leveraged. Started with 1000 shares at 21,63$ 19 jan. Stock went down today so figured it's time to buy the dip. Got 2000 more shares at 20,99$ today. Figured out this can't go tits up so bought 3500 more shares at 21,289$ today 21/01.

Now here's the DD with 13 reasons why $VST is gonna moon for sure.

1. CLEAN ENERGY: Vistra Corp is a clean energy/electricity producer, makes electricity with solar panels, wind and shit. With the green wave just starting, this is the future of energy.
2. BATTERY/ENERGY STORAGE : Vistra is the BIGGEST player in the game of Lithium-ion battery energy storage. Yes you heard me right, Vistra's facilities are bigger than papa Elon's (Sorry papa, please forgive me for my sins). Vistra is currently building those massive Battery/energy storage facilities in both Texas and California. Papa Elon's energy storage projects in California and Texas are just behind in line as the second biggest in both states. Don't believe me? Just look it up, I'm not making this stuff up.
3. INSIDERS RECENT MASSIVE BUY-IN: Look at those beautiful bars (Image 1 and 2). Insiders have literally only bought shares in the last months at around today's stock price. They know their shit. This is undervalued cause it was discarded by funds as a boring stable non-growth dividend stock, which it is absolutely NOT, and those insiders know it.

&#x200B;

4) BIDEN'S CLEAN ENERGY SUBSIDIES/STIMULUS: Biden just cancelled the Keystone XL project. If he doesn't want to encourage oil, where is he planning on getting energy??? Renewable shit like solar is the way to go!! Subsidies and big green energy stimulus coming our way boys!

5) THE EV CRAZE: Those EV companies growing massively are gonna need some fuel guys. Electricity demand is booming. So will Vistra.

6) GROWTH OUT OF US: Vistra make acquisitions in Japan in October. It's expending it's operations in both Japan and Canada. Again this clearly goes to show this is a growth stock valued right now at a boring stable dividend stock price.

7) BIG WELL ESTABLISHED BUSINESS: VST is the largest competitive residential retail electricity provider in the US. With a 10billion market cap, this is the real deal. Not a NKLA bullshit corp. This company is solid and is for sure gonna be the #1 clean energy provider in the near future.

8) SOLID BALANCE SHEET: Look at those beautiful graphs (image 3). Profitable company with rapidly growing earnings and new profit generating battery projects on the way, all of that in a clean energy growing phase of the economy.

&#x200B;

9) GREAT DEBT RATIO: Debt ratio decreasing every year as the company became profitable! Look at that beautiful Debt to equity graph which says it all (Image 4)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4xf2rovlpqc61.png?width=1722&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ba078d095c5833fec396a726b2366c0b09a375c

10) HIGHLY UNDERVALUED STOCK PRICE: This Corp has a fucking P/E at 11.8x!!!! This is just absolutely insanely stupidly low considering the average US Renewable energy business P/E stands at 53x, and average US market P/E is at 21x. Even the P/B is low at total retard levels at 1,2x. For those who don't know fundamentals, a P/B at 1,2x means that at today's 21,5$ stock price, if the business were to close down everything, sell all it's assets, pay all of it's debts and liabilities and give what's left to shareholders, you'd be getting about as much as what you paid for. This is just plainly stupidly low for not only a growing stock, but an EV and green energy related stock as well.

The good thing about an undervalued stock is that even if you're a scared loser Cramer Boomer who spits on GME and PLTR, there's no way that an investment in Vistra can go sour right now at today's prices since it's undervalued even without considering growth! This is the perfect stock for retards as well as boomers.

11) DIVIDENDS AND SHIT: Dividends are for pussys. But if you want em', Vistra gives em'.

There's proof of my stake in image 5. It's in Beaver dollars but do the math, it all adds up in USD. If this post and $VST gains traction, I swear I'm buying 1000 more of the stock when it goes up to 25$ and I'll even go sell the rest of my portfolio to buy more shares if you retards want me to. As long as I've got money to buy, I'm buying this crap.

Groupthink and Tribalism on WSB,0.92,"Reddit has a impulse to become an echo chamber because of how the upvote and downvote mechanics work. People who are downvoted get their posts and comments hidden and eventually get muted, and Karma does motivate people to seek upvotes. The best examples are how r/politics become completely blue dominated with no alternative views, or people will post things on r/nottheonion and the comments get dominated as if it is r/politics. Alongside this, you see a gradual reduction in nuance, which in r/politics became ""mango bad"".  You see this throughout other subs on non-political topics once a tribal identity forms, and there is a strong tribal narrative on one side of an issue, and then people passionately downvote anything not in agreement.

On WSB, the mods banned political comments to prevent this kind of tribal BS seeping into the sub. But, we are starting to get extremely tribal about specific meme stocks to the point where it's very difficult to get quality DD on the other end of the issue. An awful lot of top posts do not have humor value as memes, and are basically - <ticker I YOLOed my entire account into>  🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀  followed by trash talk about some skeptic somewhere. I feel like arguing with people about a hot ticker now is like arguing with an anti-vaxxer friend about Moderna, or a blue friend about Mango's actual governmental actions, or a red friend about vote counting. It's really hard to be constructive or for anyone to get smarter.

If the goal of this sub is to collectively pump particular stocks, I guess this is true to form, but if the goal of this sub includes discussion to inform better trading outcomes for participants, this dynamic is greatly reducing the quality of trading discussion. Right now, the feed is almost exclusively just two tickers, and those threads have very few contrary views, even well thought out ones. When well thought-out comments are added that are not rockets and buy buy buy and either correct inaccuracies in the post or provide a reasoned alternative perspective, they get downvoted out of visibility. Even 4 or 5 months ago, I felt this sub was a lot different than stocktwits, but it's hard to tell the difference sometimes now.  I really want to be part of a community where we consistently find insight and trades that everyone else thought was dumb but was in reality brilliant, and that holds up some time later. The GME value thesis at $5 is one of those. So too was BTFDing the pandemic, and shorting it too.

I think this current tribalism is going to lead to worse trading outcomes for the sub in the long run. When we front-run a big wave of increasing bid on a stock, and then that price becomes stable or we exit before it's not, we outperform the market. That happened big time last year with Coronavirus, and has happened repeatedly with TSLA. In other cases we try to forget, it's been the opposite, like multiple times ahead of AMD earnings, PRPL, and over-exuberance with PLTR into the 30s. Basically, if we pump the stock, and then the broader community of investors doesn't come around to the point of view, we are stuck with the bag. And a lot of these outcomes come from when we are all-in and super emotional about it, which I think we all know is NOT how to trade if you want the best results.

We should stop downvoting posts and comments that are well written, and instead leave them alone or up vote them. By all means, downvote bullshit troll posts and straight up haters, but if you downvote quality contrary views, you make everyone here a worse trader, and increase the echo chamber that leads the sub to over-extend.",2021-01-21 17:28:03

GME VSA Analysis from this week's trading,0.98,"I trade futures and some currencies, but am intrigued by the hype on GME on this thread. I bought 1 share just to be a part of it before even pulling up a chart.

&#x200B;

As the market moves up and down, it's important (to me)to take note of where the relatively larger volume is traded.

&#x200B;

As you can hopefully see clearly on my 5 minute markup, volume comes into the market beneath the highs, as opposed to people taking profit and exiting positions at the highs (which im sure there is some of) it looks like this weeks volume comes in after a high is made and a discount is offered.

&#x200B;

This is good for your rockets.

GME Gang: On the Subject of the Golden Bridge and Its Inevitable Destruction By Fire 🚀🚀🚀,0.97,"*Build your opponent a golden bridge to retreat across.*

**Sun Tzu, Art of War**

*Everything was for tomorrow, but tomorrow never came. The present was only a bridge and on this bridge they are still groaning, as the world groans, and not one idiot ever thinks of blowing up the bridge.*

**Henry Miller, Tropic of Capricorn**

*I was wrong! Blow the bridge! Blow the fucking bridge!*

**Tugg Speedman, Tropic Thunder**

Hello again GME Gang! It’s been a while since I last ranted at you, but I know we’ve been in some very good hands here at WSB with all the great DD folks have posted over the past few weeks. So no need for CPT Hubbard to go for 11 again on the Thumbscroll Dial (until today, that is). I’ve enjoyed a lot of these posts very much, so thank you on behalf of myself and the attention-deficient Rocket Children for continuing to deliver that 100% Chaff-Free GME-grade Wheat at such a feverish clip.

Now, I am going to get to Hong Kong’s [Lamest Outlaw](https://www.scmp.com/business/money/investment-products/article/2009448/hong-kong-finds-citron-researchs-andrew-left) and his disconcertingly vacant eyes here shortly. But first I want to take you on a journey back to Christmas Eve, in the year of our lord 2020—a heady time in all our lives. We were all so young and innocent then, weren’t we? Fresh off the run up to 22. Blissfully oblivious that we were living in the last moments where the question What is The War of 1812? was the only acceptable Jeopardy question for the answer: The Last Time the Goddamn U.S. Capitol Was Stormed. This was also before we all became irresponsibly overleveraged in Cathie Wood’s Ornamental Gourds ETF. It was a wondrous, confusing time.

But before we get too off topic, let’s all hop in my 1985 DeLorean (purchased with proceeds from my Jan 15 calls – thanks RC!), fire up the ol’ Flux Capacitor, and get that shit to 88 because something happened that evening that is Worth Pondering—particularly in light of recent events. And just as a friendly reminder: even though you’re going back in time in a DeLorean, no one here has to deviate funds away from GME shares to Save the Clock Tower and you are under no obligation to fulfill a scenario where you wind up making out with your Mom (unless your Mom is Cathie Wood like mine—in which case maybe just some quick over-the-clothes stuff).

**On the Subject of How It Once ‘Twas The Night Before Christmas**

So what in the holy fuck happened on the night before Christmas, Captain? Well, while all you Gentiles were sleeping soundly after lying to your children about benign home intruders and before gorging yourself on the teat of late-stage capitalism, me and the rest of the Chosen People were up late eating Chinese food and thinking about tendies (self-hating Jew Joke! Ba-zing!). But then: when out on the electric twitter machine there arose such a clatter, I sprang to my phone to see what was the matter. And what to my wondering eyes did appear, a mysterious tweet from a Rich-Ass Viking who had a lot of fucking interesting things to say about this whole GME situation that’s what.

This tweet, buried as a reply to a tweet sent by Mr. Rod Alzmann (@RodAlzmann or [u/Uberkikz11](https://www.reddit.com/u/Uberkikz11/)), simply said: “Merry Christmas. Shhh.” But it included this screen shot:

\[\*\*Image Deleted Due to the Mods - check the link below where someone transcribed it - I'll try to add later\*\*\]

Now, this tweet to Rod, sent late at night and likely after a strong Mead or three, was very promptly deleted. But your intrepid cub reporter saw this here tweet that night with his own two eyes—seeing as I am a degenerate GME addict and devoted follower of Mr. Rod Alzmann (Hi Rod!). And I took screenshots, of course, like any responsible records custodian might. And so did the dude who wrote a somewhat-overlooked WSB post on this, which included the most pertinent text of the message if you are having trouble reading it here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kk0omp/christmas\_miracle\_gamergate\_2020\_gme\_shorts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kk0omp/christmas_miracle_gamergate_2020_gme_shorts/)

Now, what are we to make of this? At the time, I thought it was very interesting. But I did not give it too much attention seeing as how the internet is overcrowded with anonymous weirdos claiming to know more than they do about all sorts of subjects (and now I feel your judging eyes…). Also, there was some very good commentary in that WSB post from some sharp folks about the screenshot author’s questionable use of the shorthand PE/IB—given that private equity and investment banks wouldn’t apparently be involved in a behind-the-scenes transaction with the short funds like what was being discussed there (don’t ask me, I just string together silly words here). But maybe you poke around his [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KjetillStjerne) a bit and see for yourself.

Still, plausibility assessments based on preferred nomenclature aside, it seemed to me that some version of that conversation **had** to be taking place behind the scenes in a situation like this—given the batshit insane short interest, the funds supposedly involved, and the rapid rise in SP coinciding with RC’s share accumulation, December 21st amended 13D filing, and new status as a GME Insider and Board member (just love saying all that in a row, don’t you?).

So the Viking’s screenshot tweet, and the very likely possibility that shorts are in so deep that they’re attempting to negotiate peace with large shareholders behind the scenes, stuck in my tiny little baby brain as a pretty plausible set of scenarios. And from the look of it, it seems like some funds were at least willing to discuss offering these shorts a Golden Bridge away from Certain Fucking Destruction on the open market. And if the words on the screenshot are at all aligned with reality, these short funds have no good options. 

Yet it seems like they are still playing hardball to negotiate the carat on this generous bridge offer they’re getting. Why? Maybe they’ve been getting high on their own supply for so long and they don’t know how to see this situation for what it is. Who knows? Maybe there is no Ryan Cohen and we’re all living in a simulation. But if the recent low-rent anti-GME articles and market manipulation efforts we’re seeing are any indication, these overleveraged short fuckers seem to think they’re going to be able to spin out of this hold and drive the SP back down to even *smaller* peanuts than it’s at now by sheer force of will (and some deployment of well-honed tricks of the trade *amirite*?) to emerge unscathed. Or even victorious? I dunno—it’s their delusional fantasy sequence.

But do you know what this scenario reminds me of? And this is just coming to me so please bear with me as I’m not showing this to my editor before we print (I haven’t seen this movie in ages – don’t know what made me think of this!). Fuck it, I’m just gonna start riffing here. The shorts trying to thread this needle, against all odds and logic and common sense, reminds me of that hilarious scene in Dumb and Dumber where haplessly delusional Jim Carrey thinks he has a chance with Mary Samsonite Swanson. But the scene is funny because he really doesn’t. Have any chance. At all.

Now, I know this is a 1990s movie originally released on VHS that we haven’t seen or seen it referenced in ages. But now that you’re thinking of it again after all this time, doesn’t it remind you of this too? I know, I get it: You’d have to have fucking peanuts for brains for it not to.

**On the Subject of the Continued Internet Bumbling of Mr. Justin Dopierala**

Now that screenshot came to mind this past week when something kind of weird happened while we were all enjoying our quick rocket ship ride. And yes, we are briefly going to talk again about Seeking Alpha’s second finest pro-GME author (always been more of a Dmitriy man myself) and recurring CPT Hubbard character, Justin Dopierala (and no, Angela, I do not want to have like 10,000 of his babies).

Last Thursday, after we were all virtually high-fiving one another and counting our future Lambos, Mr. Justin Dopierala, head of Domo Capital and longstanding uber-bull GME shareholder and author at Seeking Alpha (last seen arguing pithily with our own Rod Alzmann about the conservative nature of Rod’s holiday earnings projections. Hi again Rod!), made it known that he sold all of Domo Capital’s 500,000 shares for around $42.50—at the very top of the run up last Thursday morning.

Now, Domo Capital’s business decisions are none of my goddamn business. And there are plenty of market opportunities right now. Shit, I hear there is even a new Cathie Wood Gourd ETF coming online soon that people are really excited about and that I’m sure Justin’s clients would find intriguing. But Domo’s decision to sell seemed curious given a few things: (1) on Wednesday, when the rocket is mid-flight, he got a twitter follow from Gabe Plotkin, head of Melvin Capital, which he promptly tweeted about with a “get a load of this fuckin’ guy” vibe (oh the sweet, intoxicating arrogance of tendie victory, I too love it so); (2) he had also tweeted that day comparing GME’s rise to Apron’s short squeeze that lasted 4 days—where he also stressed to his followers that Apron had a *much lower* SI than GME; and (3) he then promptly **deleted** all of these tweets and almost everything else GME-related on Thursday after apparently introducing 500,000 shares of liquidity into the height of a stressed market up and through the Thursday reversal and down into his own personal tendie town.

Now, after seeing all this, I mouthed off a bit to Justin on the electric twitter machine because that’s kind of my thing. And if you are familiar with my prior ramblings, you know that he and I go way back. In response, Justin talked a bit of shit about your intrepid cub reporter here in a comment on Dimitry Kozin’s October 21, 2020 article about a possible sony revenue share deal or something, the comment section of which has become the preferred SA water cooler over there. (And I can’t link that because Thems The Rulez). And Justin hurt my little feelings a bit with his very sharp denial. And by all means have at it over there to check out his comment about why he sold if you give a shit. That is if Justin hasn’t deleted it yet. Free country and all.

But to summarize, on the subject of treacherous coordination with Melvin Capital, Justin said he would not could not in a boat and he would not could not with a goat. And I for one believe him. And do you know why? Because even though Justin seems like a very smart guy in some ways, he’s also a well-known internet bumbler who blurts out things to his internet friends that a person with better self-control would keep to themselves. And so I do not think he is capable of pulling that off or keeping a secret like that. Also: he said he didn’t so I am more than willing to give someone the benefit of any doubt in that area and you should too. I think we keep Hanlon’s razor firmly in mind here about never attributing to malice that which is explained by stupidity. That is unless, of course, you’re Andrew Left and you’re actually trying to convince people that you didn’t realize there was a US presidential inauguration planned for the same time you announced your Super Important TeeVee Yammerfest ‘21 about GME not being a good candidate for an imminent short squeeze no way no how not if my name isn’t Andrew Left short seller expert extraordinaire and Hong Kong’s Most Misunderstood Ethically-Minded Businessman. You can ascribe the fuck out of malice to that one.

No, even though I really have no idea, I think the most likely thing that happened there was that Gabe Plotkin, Master of the Universe, Head of Melvin Capital, and Acolyte of Perennial Most Ethical Business Man MVP candidate, Steven Cohen—got into Justin’s head when Plotkin followed him on twitter during the 57% (at one point 94%) day last Wednesday and then Justin got a bit chippy about it.

And this is the real reason I’m bringing this up.

Because I honestly care very little about the Nervous Investing Habits of the Wisconsin hedge fund voted most likely to prompt a Mr. Roboto reference. No: I think that Gabe Plotkin sent a message with that follow. Without even ever having to say it directly. And I think that after GME’s huge run and getting a little overexcited while working the twitter machine, Justin maybe had a chance to relax with a warm glass of milk that night and reflect on that message. Which I believe was: ***I’m watching you, motherfucker***. *And the only reason I’m paying any attention to some shitstain Wisconsin pseudo-fund on a day like today when I am getting my ass fucking torched is because I want you to know that if this GME shit blows up on me, I’m going to fuck your ass up.* *I will remember the name Domo Capital forevermore.* *And when you least expect me, I’ll be there. Now: your move, motherfucker.*

And once I realized what might have happened there, that made me feel kinda bad for Justin if he felt that way. Definitely a puss move because fuck you Plotkin I drink your fucking milkshake, right? But bad because that’s a mean message for a business colleague to send, Gabriel. Shame on you if that's how you roll like a big New York bully and scaring our poor Justin like that. And if you just wanted to follow him to shoot the shit or swap listicles and Star Wars Prequel memes with a respected contemporary—even in the very midst of getting fucking annihilated while short GME—well Justin has a totally different account for that and he’s not allowed to access it during work hours.

**On The Likelihood That The Most Heavily Shorted Stock in History Is Not Been Subject to Continued Market Manipulation When A Steve Cohen Acolyte Is Losing His Fucking Shirt**

Have you heard about Steve Fucking Cohen? The guy who looks like he’s tip top of the list of the premier Hollywood casting agency’s rolodex for Saddest Dipshit Still At the Strip Club After Everyone Else Has Already Gone Home? I’m sorry, that’s mean and my mother told me to always be kind to the truly hideous looking because they’re probably still beautiful on the inside (spoiler alert: he’s not!).

Get a load of this guy:

Are you back? I’ve missed you. That was scary, wasn’t it? But allow me to **TL/DR** all that for you who decided to avoid all that unpleasantness: the dude just has all this bad luck and keeps finding himself into these really awkward situations where someone could potentially question his commitment to ethical business and life practices as well as adherence to the laws of the United States and it’s just not fair and nothing’s fair and Nice Guy Steve Cohen Is The Victim Here So Just Stop Right There Mister I See What You’re Doing. He's also bros with Guy Fieri. Cool.

But why am I talking about a guy who would so clearly pass Billy Madison’s Final Question about Business Ethics without even breaking a sweat?

Because Steve Cohen once had a young Ace Protegee that he loved very much. With the name of an Archangel, so tender and pure. And one day this young man decided he wanted to Prove Himself and Leave Steve’s Nest. And thus was born Melvin Capital, seeded financially by Steve Cohen but named after famed Crooner Melvin H. Tormé, which Gabe’s esteemed mentor Steve would play in his office, over and over, all those years ago.

Now let’s fast forward a bit because I’m boring myself with all that fucking Cohen reading (the *bad* Cohen—don’t you dare get anyone confused here). As I was saying: Gabe Plotkin, head of Melvin Capital, has by all accounts gotten himself into a bit of a pickle here being so deeply short GME. Lots of people have analyzed and overanalyzed it, and I’m not going to do it again here; that dead horse is well and truly beaten. But to bottom line it: we’re all just staring down what is essentially an unprecedented math problem that will, at some point, resolve itself. And if it revolves itself in favor of the Good Guys, then the Bad Guys will lose a Fuck-ton of Money. That’s your money block quote, WSJ, so fuck off and stop calling me.

Now: picture yourself as a Steve Cohen acolyte that just bought a [$44M Miami Compound](https://therealdeal.com/miami/2020/12/07/melvin-capital-founder-revealed-as-buyer-of-44m-miami-beach-property-sources/) and who cannot stop talking about how [co-owning the Charlotte Hornets](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/charlotte-hornets/article232128902.html) is worth it just for the courtsides alone bro once basketball is a thing again and so what if Michael Jordan keeps calling him Gary it’s close enough. Are you feeling the most financially secure that you have ever felt in your young rich life right about now? Or might you be a wee bit worried that you’ve pursued an investment thesis so reckless, so irrationally and intentionally destructive of equity, that even Melvin H. Tormé himself must be rolling in his fucking grave that you would ever dare put at risk your ability to continue being Michael Jordan’s Gary?

And so here is when I again link my good buddy Jim Cramer’s [Great Unveiling of the Tactics Deployed by Short Sellers](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l09n23/it_all_makes_sense_about_cramer_now_if_youre/) hoping to change the narrative and construct a “new truth” to suppress the SP in the face of, oh, let’s just say: a very promising turnaround story in a high-growth industry by an e-Commerce Canadian Genius who does not fuck around and who knows what he’s fucking doing and aims to sell more and better video games experiences to crackhead video gamers and there’s a million things he wants to do but just you wait, just you wait.

Is this plot that hard to follow?

And I’ll also say this: I know fuck-all about monitoring order flows or how funds continue to create synthetic shares to short shit into oblivion. But I’m just stepping back and thinking of the broader narrative and tactics on this. Spit-balling here again—bear with me. Now, if you were massively short a security while paying out your ass in borrowing fees for the privilege of entering the most crowded short trade in the market and you’re now opposite a massive business turnaround story, Ryan Cohen, numerous institutions, funds, retail whales, Norwegian HNW Freemason Consortiums, and the energy behind the Finest Rocket Children Ever to Grace Planet Fucking Earth—and you’re taking it in the ass week after week here—Do you then play this straight? Do you set aside all of these illegal and deceptive short tactics Jim Cramer candidly outlines in that video even though they’re impossible to enforce and are in fact *not* enforced? That Jim basically says you’d be professionally negligent if you were short and didn’t do this shit because fuck it *whosgonnastopyou*? And now you fucked up and that steamroller is barreling down upon you and there are all these things you *could theoretically* do try to get yourself out of this jam if you were That Kind of Person? Do you set this all aside and, at least in Jim’s view, tie one hand behind your precious ethical back? On the most heavily shorted stock off all time where you are bleeding Real Life Big-Boy Money? Just buying and selling you know, just a job, honest living, nothing much to it, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, can't get too carried away with it.

*Or is it something a little bit fucking different than that?*

I don’t know. I’m not in the industry myself. And I would never accuse anyone of doing anything so clearly contrary to the values upon which their professional career as Master of the Universe was built. So Gabe: chill. Don’t follow me or something on twitter man, since for all I know that’s Plotkinese for I Hope You Don’t Mind Sleeping With This Severed Horse Head in Your Bed Motherfucker. It’s just money, dude. You seem pretty well taken care of. But man would I be sweating if I were short right now staring down the barrel of your new neighbor Ryan Cohen’s whims and patience and polite Canadian manners and ambiguous emojis that we all lose our shit for. I mean, fuck man: are you ok? Don’t forgot to exercise and eat well during all this. Maybe switch to green tea or something. And remember: you’ll always—always—be Michael Jordan’s Gary.

But here is where we return to our good friend Andrew Left from Citron Research.

Do you remember the excitement you felt this past weekend? I’ve never seen WSB so jacked. People were coming out hot on Tuesday—an uptick day! The new phone book’s here! The new phone book's here! What luck to be free of Gary’s tomfoolery for one fine day. And then GME spiked right away—reaching a high of over $45 that morning.

But then something happened. We all know what it was. But here is where any SEC lookie-loos need to close those Pornhub links and pay closer attention. Because in the moments before the Citron tweet that morning about Andy’s upcoming BuzzFeed Listicle call on Why GME is Scary Investment GRRRR, total short shares available **dropped from 1.2M to 0**. And a **$300K put bet** was placed on a weekly with a strike price well over 10% out of the money at the very moment that GME’s price was accelerating rapidly. (H/t [u/FatAspirations](https://www.reddit.com/u/FatAspirations/)). That’s some WSB-level retard shit right there, whoever you are.

And yet they pull it off! GME immediately shoots down nearly 30% intraday, and eventually climbing abck up above 10%, making us all feel a little weird and like ungrateful millennial brats for feeling so shitty about a 10% day. But we all know what fucking happened, now don’t we?

So what can we say about ol’ Andy? Now, many of you know Andy as the dumbshit who shorted TSLA until he was ground into little bits of dumb dumb dust and made to look ever so foolish over and over again until he finally cried drunk uncle and flipped to being long TSLA and now he’s cool to you or whatever. Or you might know him as the guy who puts out really shoddy research that often, by pure happenstance, drives a new narrative to control the orderflow and SP on a WSB-beloved security like PLTR? You know the guy I’m talking about. Once in hot pursuit by Hong Kong fuzz, an International Man of Obviousness with a face that says: why yes, I *will* have another vodka tonic *thankyouverymuch*. That’s him.

Well, just like future call-back candidate for the role of Frightened Inmate #2, Mr. Steve Cohen, Andy is also but a Caveman—frightened and confused by your modern concepts of “ethics” and “rules.” No! No!—He’s a straight shooter! Devoted to rooting out obvious frauds, like Lukin Coffee and TSLA (Do not fuck with Elon or my Hot Mom’s ETF, Andy). And like the aspirations of Antoine Bugle Boy when he entered the blue jeans market, Andy saw an overcrowded short trade here based on an overly simplistic and obsolete short thesis about GME and said: “Me Too!” And as this thing is ripping to the stratosphere, Andy starts ringing his dumb dumb twitter bell and saying hear ye, hear ye—Inauguration Day and time it shall be for all my Big Brain thoughts about GME! Nothing weird about that. No sir.

So Andy Citron or whatever the fuck his name is will be putting out some dumbshit video or something today in what seems to be a pretty clear attempt to scare my poor Rocket Children and get those pesky computers to high frequency this shit to drive the SP down to more acceptable loss levels (cause let’s be honest: they’re still taking a fucking bath here) for Melvin H. Tormé’s namesake hedgefund and all the other cretins that are dug into short position here. And they’re gonna try to scare ya’ with the color red! And they know that no one here likes the color red.

But do see what’s going on here and who we’re dealing with. This really ain’t rocket science, Rocket Children. The dude actually tried to claim he forgot about the Inauguration. In 2021. He has not been in a coma, to the best of my knowledge. But you do look a little bleary eyed, Andy. Must have been all that staying up super late working on those last few bullet points to fill out the powerpoint on that GME listicle of yours, eh sport?

**Conclusion: On the Subject of Patience and The Arc of The Universe Bending Toward Ryan Fucking Cohen**

*In my youth there was a period of time where I went out on boats that would drop crates into the waters of the Arctic. Bundled inside them were raw pieces of meat. In the coming days the boats would head back out to the frigid seas, hook the floats bobbing upon the waters, and pull the crates up. Packed inside would be many crabs. They were so delicious & made a good price at market. The difference between the crate that was empty and the create full of bounty was a mystery even the great physicist Erwin Schrödinger pondered at much length.*

*But the hearty fishermen of my youth already knew the answer long ago. Why did the trap fill up? Time. In time, all traps fill. In time, all things pondered shall be revealed.*

**--The Fucking Viking, That’s Who**

Now look, you all know I have a soft spot for Ryan Cohen. Hell, we all do. He’s a good dude. And the man has played this flawlessly so far. He really has. The fact that we are all sitting here with Ryan Cohen having successfully negotiated three seats on the Board—a bloodless coup as my man Rod Alzmann says—here in January? It’s amazing. His vision for GME is dialed-the-fuck in and extremely exciting. This misunderstood business is on the threshold of an exciting turnaround with Ryan Cohen at the helm. And though I was very much looking forward to the potential repercussions of a vote being called at the annual meeting and what that might mean for the short-term share price, this result is infinitely better. Whatever their motivations, that Board and George Sherman saw the writing on the wall here and accepted the Golden Bridge that Ryan offered them. And Ryan Cohen has done everything he’s set out to do here. And he’s clearly been having fun while doing it. Read up on the guy at some point if you haven’t–there’s lots of good DD out there on him, obviously. And while you’re reading and thinking about Ryan Cohen, think also about guys like Steve Cohen (*no* *fucking relation*) and Gabe Plotkin and Andy Left and how lucky we are that we get to roll with RC against that motley crew of fuckwads.

And do you know what? I’m guessing that RC, and maybe even the funds being discussed in that screenshot, have been very patient with Mr. Plotkin *et al* in recent weeks. You don’t go around bankrupting hedge funds willy nilly, you know--bad form and all that old chap. People tend to remember that. And guys like Steve Cohen and Gabe Plotkin seem like they play for keeps. So now you try to build them a Golden Bridge to cross—maybe not their preferred route of travel, but could be worse and all that, right guys? But for whatever reason it seems like the natural instinct here on the short side is fight over flight. And these short FUD tactics are getting increasingly ridiculous to help slow down the inevitable march toward the detonator right next to that bridge. So relax everyone! And let’s not fool ourselves: All those Masters of the Universes are well aware of the math problem they’re all facing here and they must have a vague grasp of the odds that this goes off in one direction over the other. And what that could mean for the size of their money pits and how many sports teams they can buy this year. Shit, I assume Steve Cohen is counseling his young acolyte about how many sads he himself felt deep down in his man heart on that fateful day in 2008 when he lost $250M on a short when Volkswagon squeezed to infinity—a sadness that he will continue to draw on when his agent finally finds him a role that calls for it.

But my point is: the longs here can afford to be patient and let this play out. When this thing moves, the Viking’s Schrödinger crabs will only be in one fucking pot. And I’m guessing that pot is the one being held by the guy who is actually in total control here: Ryan Goddamn Cohen.

So enjoy the show today. If you’re anything like me, you’re feeling relaxed after gorging yourself on lucky space peanuts all week.(https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/10022/lucky-peanuts/)

And though these silly wabbits with their cumbersome FUD efforts can get a bit tiresome, I’m still very much enjoying this GME show at this point and almost do not want it to end—what with all these Sorkin-esque twists and turns and my Cohen Tweet Decorder Ring getting all this sweet action.

But just remember who Ryan Cohen is, what he cares about, and what, so far, he has told us he intends to do here. And then you might realize, as I have, that Ryan Cohen has had the Gray’s Sports Almanac here all along. This story has already been written. He’s already won. And Melvin Capital’s Schrödinger-ass crabs are dead as fuck. The only question now is: what causes that Golden Bridge to blow? I, for one, am content to wait on RC while counting my good fortune that I can continue to accumulate until whatever happens here happens. So pass the rocket peanuts.

It’s just money after all. Right Gabe?

**TL/DR**: *Psst*: a Mysterious Viking once told me about behind-the-scenes Golden Bridge negotiations that are likely taking place that give shorts no chance but the shorts seem to think they’re saying there’s a chance but there really is no chance; Gabe Plotkin, Steve Cohen and Andy Left are misunderstood Straight Shooters who probably answer typical interview questions about their own perceived weaknesses by saying “Sometimes I just care *too much* about doing the right thing”; and Ryan Cohen is the Goddamn Man so we can all relax and not worry so much about all this dumb short FUD bullshit, ok? OK. **🚀🚀🚀**

Sound the Alarm! VIAC is the pick of the year!,0.49,"I’ve been trying to inform the great community for the past 2 months. VIAC is the next big pick for WSB and the markets are taking notice before the WSB can get in on the fun. 

Yes I’m trying to help! Yes I want the tendies! And yes you probably think this is stupid, what are you talking about GME all day bro. TSLA to the moon bro. 

No stop it. I’m talking about one of the most undervalued stocks in the hottest market segment, no this is not a motley fool boomer pitch, this is Viacomcbs. This is the fucking rocket ship. We are looking at a 4-5 x return once streaming potential is even partially realized.

Little secret, VIAC is n third place in streaming with 18 million paid subs. Other plays are stuck with their botched launch, VIAC has 2 services that have been profitable and open for 6 plus years. CBS All access soon to be paramount plus and showtime. 

The biggest play for the company isn’t paid streaming although it will be a huge piece of business. No the real opportunity is in Pluto TV which is the leading FREE AD SUPPORTED STREAMING TELEVISION. FAST. 

Fast is free tv paid for by ads. It’s basically the internet’s version of a 2005 cable box from Comcast. 

You have so much old content that can still generated revenue. Look at the recent Netflix VIAC deal
For narcos on Pluto or look at the library content they have. 

I am trying my best but it’s hard to break through the loud voices of GME right now. 

I would hate to see y’all miss this boat, it’s finally becoming safe enough for me to want to mention it. The turnaround is finally underway for real and we are still at the beginning. 

The Investor day is 2-24-2021 and that’s the big trade right there. 

I’m about to buy more options for 3-19 45c 50c 52.5c as well as leaps and some equity. Almost all in over 20k at risk. 

This is your moment to break the shackles of your losses. If you are sick because you missed GME or TSLA or any other big profitable moves this is your chance. 

I can’t help but feel like no one is gonna pay any attention until it’s too late to buy but y’all can’t say I didn’t try and raise the alarm. 

All traders need to pay attention and look for new ideas. Not just OTM calls on TSLA and GME. 

I am using OTM calls for this as well but it’s much safer with ITM calls.

As we now, Biden is now in office and stocks rallied yesterday as he came into the office, but fuck we all should have saw that coming with how the media treats him, people get that warm feeling and get more confident thus the market goes up. that shit is elementary. Anyways, here are the top 3 stocks Im watching today (along with most of you retards).

BB - Moon ball soon. BB has start to get the attention of this subreddit the past couple of days, and we know what happens to stocks when they get our attention, they go up. In all seriousness though they own a ton of patents in the EV car space, only about 20-30% of EV cars are out on the market, I really don't even comprehend how big of a market this could be in 5-10 years (or sooner) with how tech keeps advancing. Im super long on this shit like most.

GME - Is there much to say? Short squeeze is coming and this is taking the fuck off. End of story. WSB owns this stock and if you need more on this, literally read the subreddit, Im not going to post anything different than anyone else has, long on GME.

GOLD - this one is dumb, but over the next 4 years I think it will be a nice return (it may not be retarded but you should make money). Biden is going to print a hella lot of money, possibly remove student loan debts, the dollar is going to be worthless the more shit he does, gold with be KING. Janet already said she will curtail the B word needs to be destroyed and we saw that tank yesterday. GOLD will be king again .

GME DD - Real talk about how Boomers are not enemy,0.87,"Hey Autists,

Been lurking for the memes, but thought I'll share my piece since I'm deep in on GME.

Let's back out and think a little bit about why there is so much short interest on GME. Boomers like everyone else are trying to capitalize on patterns they see. What is the pattern they are seeing? JCPenny and ToyRUs.

&#x200B;

Skimmed through some material on the fall of JCPenny and ToyRUs. TLDR: They fked up the transition to digital. (Hopefully, RC does not - I'm not a pet person, so I didn't know wtf CHEWY was before this, but he somehow made $3 Billion off of dog food... props)

&#x200B;

I know autists and retards are 🦍s and blindly chasing 🥜s, but hear me out here. If we really want GME to moon, we need boomer money to be convinced that GameStop is not JCPenny/ToyRUs. How do we do that is by making the case to the institutional money that GameStop is legit. It's obvious to us because people our age actually enjoy spending time, money, and effort on video games. And guess what? For Gen Z people, video games are a lifestyle. As more young people matriculate into the workforce, the growth for the industry only looks bright.

Now I'll sneak in a 🌈🐻 argument here. We know that the future of video games is likely going to be Sass (think DLC, Skins, and Subscriptions) so there may not be much of a space for a middlemen like GME. But, from what I understand GameStop already has a somewhat sizable customer base. As all profitable e-commerce companies do, it is not about selling the product to the people, it is about selling the people to the product - we'll see how they do. Honestly, from what I can tell their in prime position to make this work.

&#x200B;

But back to the point, if we really want to make a buck here, we have to convince boomer money that this is good idea. Let's be real here, only they have the capital to drive the price up significantly. If they do before the shorts are closed... well sorry Melvin, you made a bad trade. 🤑🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🤑

So here's the real money making strategy - convince boomers that GME is not JCPenny/ToyRUs. Boomer money likely got screwed on those companies before so we need to make the case that GME isn't that and it's in fact a really good investment.

TLDR: 💎🖐 + 👴💰 = 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Late night ramblings (Light F and GM dd with possible plays),0.77,"Disclaimer: I am not the brightest idiot in the lot but after continuously scrolling through the EV hype and other news on Ford and GM etc. I decided to do some light dd for to get a glimpse of the future of the EV and other automotive hype and try to plan some possible plays based on what I found. 

Currently No-Positions in any automotive stonks (or much of anything other than fighting for GME at the moment)

Background: No financial background. I’m just a failing engineering student who washes dishes to gamble his way out of debt.

Rockets for the autists 🚀 🚀 🚀  

Please give me feedback (good or bad)

**1.** **Ford and GM are not Tesla, but they can be damn close**

They do not have a space division or Tunneling company to influence their stock price. They are more focused on the automotive industry. This can be good to be zeroed on making good vehicles, but all of the chips are in on their vehicles performing to expectations. A slip up like the Tesla fire can be a real threat to our short-term gains. Additionally, their CEO’s (Jim Farley and Mary Barra) don’t meme their stocks so don’t expect blessings from the lord. 

On the other hand: A ton of R&D and public rallying behind EV has already been done for them by Musk and smaller EV brands, they just have to perform well to compete. We know how much Elon wants to standardize his charging plugs for his cars and any upcoming compatibility news between brands is a 🚀

**2.** **Current supply shortages**

I’ve seen the news that Subaru had to cut its production back due to the global shortage of semiconductors. It is important to remember that not just the auto industry is going green. Look at the price of lithium stocks recently and rare earth stocks. Other industries like green energy farms (Solar, Wind, Tidal) are also popping up and need these resources.  As we are starting to break away from Covid-19 hurting business, and people start to get back to work and buy things like cars. (Ford and GM were up on quarterly earnings through Covid regardless) a greater demand for cars, more specifically EV vehicles may drive demand past supply of said vehicles. This in turns leaves a shortage and Car/EV prices to increase. How can people buy new cars if there are no new cars to buy?

On the other hand: As the shortage of supply becomes more and more apparent in the market. There will be a balancing force to restabilize. I see this as increased efforts at recycling metals, and plastics as well as new mining operations for precious metals. This is very much in line with the going green policy and some of it now even now begins to take place. Lucky for us lithium is a pretty abundant resource also so I am not worried about battery shortages. Check newest $PLL and $LAC mining agreements. 

**3.** **Industry and the market adapting in the coming years**

I know a lot of you retards aren’t in this for the long haul but this may affect you if you are in it long enough to see these cars come to fruition. This kind of goes with the last one in regards to keeping price down so people can buy. As manufactures begin to struggle to source a supply of materials, a shift in design is going to have to occur to maintain sales. I see this shift as being new smaller/lighter vehicles focused on efficiency as a majority of production but EV SUV’s and Pickups definitely still being on the menu based on the success and sentiment of Tesla’s larger vehicles and other SUVs/Pickups in general. 

On the other hand: Companies like Ford and GM don’t have to rush into an all EV lineup, they’ve been making gasoline vehicles and can/will continue to do so as the market continues to shift to EV. This still gives them a source of revenue and should keep the earnings reports positive even as supplies for EV development are scarce.  

**If I were to go in what would I do?**

One of these options.

1. I run as far away from these as possible.

2. Go for the low commit play. I would buy into the hype early. I’m broke right now because of GME yolo but I could get in like 50-60 shares unstressed. We may see a discount on 1/21 with the Tesla fire to go in on Ford for the Rivian Potential. Hold till any more news hits then scram (not pussy paper hand news like “OMG Ford is a dead brand will be back to $8 easy” I’m here for gainz).

3. Buy some calls. I’m not really fluent in options so pardon my retardation but this could be a learning experience given the potential once I do some catching up and get some more gains than just buying shares. If you do not know anything about options do not trade options. Then again this is r/wallstreetbets and I’m not your wife’s bf.

4. Actual smart investment. I’m kind of in this with GME and looking past the meme and hype train and see some actual potential for these stocks and for GM and Ford to get their shit together. Jim Farley seems promising for Ford to make a difference and anyone with half a brain cell wants to get a piece of Tesla’s EV pie. I really believe that Ford has an opportunity to transform itself from a company that makes metal dogshit into something to compete with Tesla and at the very least be worth more than $15 a share. 

Thanks for your time and stay 💎🙌",2021-01-21 08:36:13

"GME - How shorts manipulated you, and how you can be better",1.0,"Hello again folks. I’m working on another DD to add to my GME EndGame series ([part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/), [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/)), but I wanted to take an aside to share my speculations on the obscene amount of manipulation happening this week by the shorts, and try to give all of you advice on how you can be more successful on GME.

**TL:DR;** GME has tremendous potential and the only reason it’s not trading at $80+ is because of active shorting. Be aware about how your positions may be helping the shorts without you knowing.

# How shorts manipulated GME this week

I’m going to preface this by saying this is speculation based on events transpired and what I know about short tactics. Consider this a narrative of how a shorter could have orchestrated all of this. I will share data where I have it. For an understanding of some of those tactics, read this [great post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l11ww7/legacy_of_wsb_jim_cramers_crash_course_in_gme/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) by u/mirkan__2.

Imagine you’re one of the big shorts on GME. You’ve been shorting this thing since 2017, 2018, 2019 and watched its stock price drop from 30 -> 15 -> 4 to a low of $3 in 2020. If you’re Bank of America, your analysts are telling you (and others) this [thing is going to $1](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/20/04/15848735/gamestops-short-term-sales-boost-to-power-down-soon-analyst-says).

But then things get out of hand, very quickly, with GME climbing from $3 -> $20 in 9 months and then in **ONE WEEK** doubling to $40. You were not prepared for this. It’s a disaster.

What do you do? You leverage every tactic you can to drive the price down.

**1) Attack retail investing capabilities:**

* Bank of America owns Merrill Lynch. Merrill Lynch has a retail brokerage. Since you’re short GME, you have your risk department over at Merrill Edge **increase the margin requirements on GME** strongly and suddenly on all retail buyers.
* **This causes a chain reaction**. Brokerages generally mimic the margin changes on other brokerages, because they don’t want to be the ones where all the “risky” traders go to. So other brokerages start increasing their requirements. Pretty soon, Schwab, Fidelity, Ameritrade, IBKR have all increased their margin requirements to the point that many buyers cannot buy more shares, or if they had bought on margin, need to liquidate or provide more capital.
* Meanwhile, the big guys - banks and hedge funds that are short - use [prime brokerages](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-prime-brokerage-4165497), and since I don’t have access to one I can’t confirm, but *very much doubt had any margin changes to GME.*

**2) Manipulative shorting:**

* On **Friday (1/15)** you take advantage of the fact that most call buyers on GME are not going to take assignment, so as they sell their calls which are now worth huge sums of money, Market-makers (MMs) are going to sell the shares they’re using to hedge the calls. So you short the stock as hard as you can, driving it down as low as 14% at one point, but it creates too strong of a sell-off triggering a short-sale restriction.

Great, at this point, you think you’ve killed some of the momentum going into the 3-day weekend. Hopefully investors will realize more of their mistake and sell off their foolish investment in the next Blockbuster. But then things go awry. Retail buyers are not shaken. In fact they’re enraged, and the GME movement grows more popular than ever, becoming the [most mentioned ticker](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1ey7e/heres_a_visualization_of_the_tomorrows_moves/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and even getting a stickied thread each day.

The US markets are closed on Monday. Doesn’t matter. Europe takes the mantle, driving the price up from 35 at close on Friday in the US to 40, then 44. **Mexico** picks up the baton, where it hits 1000 pesos, or **$50/share on Monday at 11:30 a.m.** before coming back down a bit.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3y8c8fhixmc61.png?width=921&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e07fbb6fbd0fb39a15a0429d3096760ccf0556a

You’re about to get squeezed and you need to do something fast. You can’t short the price down Tuesday in US trading because of the short sale restriction, and the momentum behind GME is palpable.

So now you get more aggressive.

**3) Orchestrated media attack & shorting:**

* Here’s what you have to work with. There are **at least** **1.2 million** shares available to short in just IBKR, and more in prime brokerages thanks to all the retail buyers buying shares in Robinhood. [“Robinhood Securities earns income from lending margin securities to counterparties.”](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/how-robinhood-makes-money/#:~:text=Robinhood%20Securities%20earns%20income%20from%20lending%20margin%20securities%20to%20counterparties.) At a **54% borrow rate,** that’s quite a nice return for RH for holding your shares.
* You call up a famous shorter known for impacting equity prices - Andrew Left of Citron. Offer him tons of money to put out a hit piece on Tuesday after markets open. It doesn’t matter that he doesn’t have shit prepared and you need him to do this tomorrow. He’s just going to threaten an attack to kill the momentum.
* Tuesday market opens. GME **rockets up 25% to $45/share** within the first few minutes. Then comes the orchestrated attack.
   * Minutes before Citron’s tweet, you buy thousands of OTM puts.
      * **1000** 1/22 40p - **26 minutes before the tweet**
      * **472** 2/29 20p - **24 minutes before the tweet**
      * **2200** 1/29 30p - **11 minutes before the tweet**
      * **424** 1/22 40p - **10 minutes before the tweet**
      * **449** 1/22 40p - **5 minutes before the tweet**

[Biggest option trades on the day of Citron’s tweet. Note that almost all of the large, long option orders are longer term, but the puts are all short term, with many coming minutes before the tweet. Keep in mind, while all this aggressive, OTM, short-term expiry put buying was happening, GME was rocketing upwards. It’s pretty obvious this was planned and not a response to price action. ](https://preview.redd.it/a9naysrkxmc61.png?width=939&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac257a1212129b1aa7d234a77cb563498a4d4fd8)

# How to be smart

As you can see, there are a number of dirty tricks here. It’s sophisticated, coordinated, and the odds are stacked against the retail investor.

There are some things you can do to trade smarter.

* **OPEX.** Imagine if every trader out there took profits of their calls at expiration. In that scenario, MMs sell the shares they used the hedge the calls, leading to a downward drift in price. If instead people rolled forward winning calls, for example, MMs would not necessarily sell the hedge (depends on delta). Selling calls before expiry if you just want to take profits sometimes means you can avoid a drop on OPEX.
* **Robinhood lends your shares and doesn't pay you for it.** Some other brokers let you choose to lend your shares. I know I can choose to lend shares or not in IBKR. It’s up to you to lend or not, but don’t let your broker lend for you and earn all that free lending money.
* **Don’t sell on dips.** You’re only helping the shorts. If you need to sell to take profits, sell when it’s heading up. *Sell high, not low retards.*
* **Save dry powder to buy on dips.** Dips manufactured by shorts are buying opportunities. Take advantage of folks with paper hands to capture shares at low points. GME has incredible daily volatility. Set a low limit buy and just wait for the order to fill. **Have patience when buying.**
* **Don’t buy calls on rips.** With everyone expecting a squeeze *at any moment* option premiums that are already high rocket to insane levels in minutes. When Citron canceled their livestream GME started to recover, call premiums skyrocketed. You’re absolutely fucked if you buy calls on rips, even if you’re right. Look at this call premium price history for today and *imagine just how fucked you are if you buy calls on rips*:

[Good luck profiting on calls if you buy on rips. ](https://preview.redd.it/hsofwiv5ymc61.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b7ee04c148c095e1f47613ded22844460fe768c)

* **Don’t advertise when you’re going to buy. Just buy dips.** There were so many folks saying “wait for 11:30 to buy!”. Well, look what happened! Just when you thought there’d be a dip, and you were all ready to buy, there was this magical, temporary rapid price spike. Congratulations, advertised to every predatory trader out there when you all were going to buy. Double-win for them: If you fomo’d in at 41 you’re probably gonna paper hands your way out when the shorts push it back down.
* **Don’t buy more than you’re willing to lose.** You need to hold through the dips, and be ok with the extreme volatility. IF you put too much into this all at once, you’re going to get scared when the price goes against you.
* **Consider exercising DEEP ITM calls.** I love u/DeepFuckingValue but he could be making more from his portfolio. He has $2.6M in cash from prior GME winnings but also 1000 April 12 calls. The april 12 calls **are trading at intrinsic value.** Exercising those calls right now would use up $1.2M of capital and add 100K shares to his account, but 1) it would not change the PnL of the portfolio, 2) would increase the liquidity (you lose on spreads when you try to sell deep itm calls), and 3) **would allow him to choose whether or not to lend the shares.** Right now, MMs have hedged his calls with 100K shares, **but they're lending them to shorts and making free money.** In the case of DFV, that's about **$6000 per day** in free money given to market makers for the privilege of lending his shares to shorts. **If you have the cash, and the options trading at intrinsic, consider exercising.** Whether you lend is up to you, but **don't give MMs free money.**

[u\/DeepFuckingValue's Portfolio. Exercising the April 12 calls would not impact his PnL, would increase liquidity, and would give him the option of lending shares \(and earning money\) or not. ](https://preview.redd.it/37hwj00gymc61.png?width=2804&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf3bb9864aee06d5d8c379b3413da2d6a7c7071a)

* **HOLD.** There is so much upside in GME, *that it doesn’t matter what price you buy now if you have patience.* There are so many potential catalysts coming and if all of this dirty behavior is any evidence shorts are scared and looking for cheap buys to get out. **Don’t give up your shares for cheap.** Here’s a quick list of potential catalysts that could happen at any time and any of which would spell more pain for shorts:
   * Share recall for a vote on major issue
   * Cohen becomes CEO
   * Alan, Jim (chewy directors added to board) purchase shares (they are not limited in how many they can buy)
   * Cohen could buy his remaining 7%
   * New higher $ investors pile in

There is some speculation that $GME will try to pivot into a gaming culture powerhouse. Reggie is an absolute ace in the hole for that.

Buy or Hold. There is no Sell.

Alright listen up everybody,  this post is motivate all you paper-handed pussies to stop selling and fucking HOLD. We are at war right now and the only way we can win is if we harden our paper ass hands into diamonds and squeeze the shit out of Melvins or Lemons or whoever is trying to fuck our wives/husbands.

&#x200B;

I've been in GME since end of Aug and already have gone through 2 agonizing battles with the shorts, the first ride up was due to the MSFT deal which gave gains of $71,857, didn't sell, went all the way down to $2,671. Second ride gave $92,378 tendies and lost it all once again due to Q3 short attack. There were tons of people telling me I should've sold....but I had DFV as an example and I trusted in all the DD that had been diligently provided. I knew the beautiful Ryan Cohen was close by to help me to stay.

As you can see in the bottom photo those peaks and troughs turned into tiny blips when you stick to your motherfucking thesis and trust that GME will give you the gainz we are all here for. Not selling until at least $420.69 - $1000 cuz fuck Melvin and Citron with their peanut allergy 🥜🥜🥜

&#x200B;

Believe me when I tell you the shorts are on the goddamn ropes:

\- They used to have roughly 50k 15p in July, sold at a loss

\- They moved those up to various strikes in January, got fucked on those

\- They spend countless dollars paying Wall Street to tell everyone how shitty owning GameStop shares are

\- They might've sucked off A. Left to play Twitter tag - couldn't even provide him with a bear thesis

138% sHoRT fLoAt! Why it's wrong (and right) to compare GameStop to Volkswagen,0.89,"Conservative estimate on why GME will squeeze to $69 ($68.85) AT THE MINIMUM.  🚀 🚀 🚀

I've seen a bunch of people on here directly comparing the Volkswagen short float (13%) back in '08 to Gamestop's short float (138%). And since GME has 10x the shorts, it'll squeeze harder or 10x harder. Stop doing that. Here's why.

First, you have to understand why Volkswagen squeezed so hard. While a 13% short float seems insignificant, what happened was Porsche secretly gobbled almost all shares of Volkswagen behind everyone's backs. Then one day, they announced that only 1% of shares were left in the public float (% of shares available to retail investors basically). Hence,  shorts rushed to close and Volkswagen squeezed. What's important to take from this is that the effective short float was 13 times the true public float. This 13:1 ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions was what caused Volkswagen to triple (2.9x) from €348 to over €1K in the single day that it squeezed.

As for GameStop, 138% is the short float that gets thrown on here pretty often, but this is dumb. While this is true, it doesn't take into account all the diamond handers and institutional investors other than Cohen and execs. If there truly were a 1.38:1 ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions, GameStop wouldn't squeeze that hard - but there isn't. So I went ahead and calculated the true, effective short float of GameStop so we can compare it to Volkswagen. These numbers are VERY conservative. I didn't include many Hedge Funds who filed 13Fs; while some might diamond hand through these times, we'll never know. So I only included Cohen, ETFs such as Vanguard who won't sell, Mutual Funds, and WSB. I included the two biggest WSB whales u/DeepFuckingValue and u/LemniscateSideEight and placed WSB institutional ownership at a conservative 5% based on a bunch of studies (done months ago so it's probably increased since then).

Institutional Certified Diamond Handers

|**Fund**|**Shares Held**|**% O/S**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC|9,534,090|13.67|
|RC Ventures LLC|9,001,000|12.91|
|BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A.|7,897,907|11.32|
|Fidelity Series Intrinsic Opportunities Fund|6,801,757|9.75|
|The Vanguard Group, Inc.|5,288,116|7.58|
|iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF|3,514,708|5.04|
|Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund|2,000,679|2.87|
|Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund|1,468,071|2.1|
|iShares Russell 2000 ETF|1,368,843|1.96|
|DFA U.S. Small Cap Value Portfolio|1,121,503|1.61|
|Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund|817,863|1.17|
|Vanguard Strategic Equity Fund|703,551|1.01|
|Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund|634,259|0.91|
|WSB: DeepFuckingValue|50,000|0.07|
|WSB: LemniscateSideEight|1,562,262|2.24|
|rest of WSB estimation|3,800,000|5.4|

Outstanding shares (not the public float) is 69.7M (nice). The people that won't sell or diamond handers adds up to 55.5M shares. Subtract that from the outstanding shares 69.7M-55.5M and we get a true public float or shares floating around of 14.2M. So based on this super conservative estimation, not including Hedge funds and most individual retail investors, we've come to an effective short float of 14.2M. If you take the latest short interest of 71M shorted shares, you get a 5:1 ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions. This is not as great as Volkswagen's 13:1 ratio, but it's still solid. Obviously, this stuff isn't linearly correlated and is more complex, but assuming GameStop squeezes 5/13 as much as Volkswagen, GameStop will squeeze 76% instead of Volkswagen's 190%. A 76% from GameStop's current share price of $39.12 is $68.85, so basically $69 (nice)!

Again, these were conservative calculations, if you play around with the numbers and include the 2 largest funds not included: Susquehanna International Group, LLP with 4.4M shares and Dimensional Fund Advisors, L.P. with 3.9M shares, this reduces the true ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions to 12:1, which basically matches Volkwagen's 13:1 scenario that tripled the stock so you could expect a GME squeeze \~$120 from this scenario.",2021-01-21 05:46:10

This is a repost with updates, if this is not OK, mods go ahead and delete, I'll just edit the original.

&#x200B;

Before I get into this, I need to say two things first. One, shorters will keep shorting, they're in too deep. Second, they will also do their absolute best to make ANYONE ELSE sell or short too, and they've had years of practice on how to manipulate people and to use the media to do it (including paid news articles).

# Reason 1: GME is a mall-store blockbuster (no future), will cite earnings reports

Please see this [very extensive Due Diligence (DD)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/) along with this [fascinating new development](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/). Also definitely worth an extensive read is [this amazing DD, on its own website](https://www.gmedd.com/).

GME is on a trajectory to do some pretty cool things, even without the short squeeze that has everyone excited. Long buyers are in. **News people are starting to pivot more and more as of Wednesday, they cannot deny the trajectory in the face of continued shorting.**

&#x200B;

Most likely things they will cite are:

1. Total sales declined 3.1% in the holiday sales report
2. Large 3rd quarter sales declines (pre-covid vs post-covid the most likely cause).
3. Closed 11% of stores (which they did to cut underperforming stores, and because their stores are FAR too dense, especially given an increased focus on E-commerce)
4. Unavailability of consoles (as if this has anything to do with Gamestop)

&#x200B;

Most likely things they will intentionally leave out:

1. Comparable store sales increased 4.8% in holiday report (so, decrease above likely because of store closures)
2. E-commerce is at 34% of company sales, equivalent to Best Buy percentage (and growing rapidly, and more rapidly than Best Buy)
3. Regional sales in Australia/New Zealand (no covid) went UP 31%

&#x200B;

# Reason 2: Insiders are selling

This is true. But here are the facts that they will leave out:

1/12/21-1/13/21: Hestia Capital (whose managing member is Wolf Kurt James) sold 945,550 shares of GME for this reason ""in order to better align with the maximum concentration guidelines for single stock investment of Hestia Capital"". The fund still owns 91,000 shares and Wolf Kurt James PERSONALLY AND DIRECTLY still owns 50,689 (including 20,000 of his wife's shares).

Also,

1/13/21: Dunn Lizabeth sold 5,000 shares of GME. She still owns 57,258.

1/13/21-1/15/21: Raul J Fernandez sold 31,119 shares of GME. He still owns 29,289 *\[updated\]*

1-13-21: Kathy P Vrabeck sold 50,000 shares of GME. She still owns 79,537.

The forms regarding the previous 3 people's sales were all filed by Dunn Lizabeth, suggesting that they sold as a coordinated choice. Also, all three of those people are NOT on the Board of Directors as proposed by RC Ventures (and conditionally agreed to by Gamestop, an agreement they'll almost definitely keep given the huge increases in share price upon RC Ventures' buy-in and policy changes that RC Ventures has strongly suggested/recommended)

Source: [SEC Filings](https://sec.report/Ticker/GME)

&#x200B;

# Reason 3: Some form of WSB bashing

1. They will likely ascribe most if not all of the upward trajectory of Gamestop to WSB. This is not entirely false: this subreddit, the repeated DDs on it, and people's ""rabid"" attention has indeed contributed to the upward trajectory. This is the age of the individual investor though, and the way media works has changed. There is nothing shady or inappropriate about large groups of people believing in something and then pursuing and/or betting on its success. This is exactly what the MM's do, the difference is that they have few people moving lots of money, and WSB has lots of people each moving a little money.
2. Y'all have been rude AF. Not saying anything against it, I'm just saying that there will be backlash to the kind of savagery we've seen against Citron and Melvin in the past few days. They will call you rabid, they will call you crazy idiots, they will call you insane gamblers, they will imply (but never say on air) that you are ""autists"" and ""retards""...and in ~~some~~ most cases, they'll even be right. However, I hope that anyone reading this who isn't a WSB fanatic will recognize that the movement of this stock, while inspired by such fanaticism, is not based on some rabid fanaticism alone (See #1, see the hundreds of tickers posted here every day).

&#x200B;

# Reason 4: The short squeeze has already happened

1. Now here, I expect them to throw up some fancy crayon data analysis looking at shares shorted or available to short or short interest % of daily trading or fees to short and try and pretend like that number really means that the shorts have already covered. Here's the important data (there's some in the DD in #1 as well).

First, [Short interest was higher than float as of EOD Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzwo2z/gme_short_interest_declined_to_71m_and_some_other/), and [still higher than float at EOD Tuesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l18jvw/gme_short_interest_update_703m_shares_short/), meaning there is an absolutely obscene # of shorted shares (a ""high"" number is often cited as 20-30%, we're at 100%). We'll see updated numbers for EOD Wednesday in the early morning. Short interest actually INCREASED during the Wed-Thurs time that Citron was originally saying was the short squeeze. Now, these are Ortex estimates based on the self-reported shares short at a large aggregate of brokerages, but have been very reliable  when compared to the official SEC data that comes out every half a month.

**Important Update here based on re-analysis.**

**The # of shorted shares from Wed-Fri was approximately 71.4M (approximately the current # of shares short). Citron's analysis will say that shorters have COVERED their original shorts, and what we are seeing now are NEW shorts at higher price points (less pressure). I think they are partially correct. However:**

**1) Shorters will have wanted to drive down price on Wed onward.** This means that the shorted shares are not necessarily new opened shorts that are still open, but may have been temporary shorts that were covered on the same day. We have seen a lot of temporary shorting in the past few days, so at least some of the shorts were due to this. In fact, I expect that a very large number of those 71.4M shorted shares were temporary shorts, based on the number of shares sold short each day over the past few months (millions per day) and the overall changes in the total number of shorted shares over the same period (almost none, relatively).

**2) Shorts have been re-opened.** The difference between their loss on a new short after covering an old short, or from holding the original short is the difference in price between those two shorts (could be as high as $20, but that's only for some of the shorts). However, **the fact that a similar level of % short/float exists today means that the EXACT SAME potential for a short squeeze is present** even if these are new shorts, but the pressure is somewhat lower as the current price MIGHT be closer to the short price.

**3) With GME's current trajectory (even if we discount Wednesday's meteoric rise and just look at the last 6 months), even those hypothetical higher price point shorts are still in significant danger.** If they weren't, we wouldn't be seeing this huge pushback from media and such aggressive market manipulation (see Tuesday's 2x1M share sell-offs).

BONUS) It's important to note that the borrowing fees, while not insignificant, are reasonably trivial for a large institution. It amounts to something like $0.03 per day per share, even at 30% on a $40 stock. They can hold for a month and if they make $1 per share, they're still up. However, this adds up. Also, eventually, the broker will need to fill real share buy orders and can force an immediate sale. Finally, if trajectory continues to go up, it just stops being worth trying to short it and someone will start a selling chain, driving up price.

&#x200B;

# Reason 5: More shares traded on some days than are short. Meaning days to cover is not close to accurate.

This is absolutely true. Days to cover is based on an average of the daily volume over the past few days. What they will say is that because daily volume is higher then shorts can cover very easily. Here's three reasons I disagree:

1. the volume shorted over the past week has consistently been around 20%+ of the daily volume. Therefore we can discount 20% of the volume as that has no net effect on the number of shorts.
2. any increase in volatility of a stock will lead to increased trading. That means more sellers, but also more buyers. **The days to cover metric is based ONLY on volume. That means that it assumes that every share bought is bought to replace a shorted share. That is unlikely to ever be the case, especially in today's market which is saturated by retail investors because of trading apps. They're using 1900s math in 2021.**
3. Trading volume has actually been decreasing since last Wednesday, while % short hasn't changed, so current volumes will mean more time to cover again compared to last Wednesday (even though days to cover isn't the greatest measure). So this is less and less in the shorters' favor as volume decreases, and we have a similar % short/float.

# So what will happen?

**THIS IS A GUESS. But, based on the sudden vanishing of shares available to short at IKBR at approximately the same time as the Citron announcement on Tuesday, I suspect tomfoolery. In addition, Citron just started doing these ""twitter Live"" things two days ago. Yes, GME wasn't the first one, but it's still a very recent new thing. At the same time, GME has had some barefaced manipulation these past few days on this sub and elsewhere in the media, not to mention the likely** [months of naked shorting](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky9mu0/gme_comrades_115_update_27_consecutive_days_on/). **Citron also conveniently decided to delay their twitter live for the inauguration, as they were hoping for a higher viewership (or potential viewership), which makes perfect sense, but still seems strange that on the SECOND LIVE TWITTER THEY DID (for the good of their viewers), THEY FORGOT ABOUT THE ELECTION.**

None of this happened yesterday because yesterday was a slightly lower volume day than usual, and their strategies to drive down price require maximum exposure. If they're very aggressive and trigger SEC Rule 201 again, they're limited in their shorting options on the next day.

Option 1: we have a repeat of Friday where shorters will try to immediately and early smash down GME price in hopes that it will keep going down after starting that trajectory. They can do this because SEC Rule 201 is not active (so they can short on a downtick again).

Option 2: Shorters will first allow stocks to rise as they did Tuesday. Then at around 11:30 (+/- 1 hour), GME will start to tank rapidly (potentially due again to some big 1M share sells). If it was me, I would time it and hit it very hard so it hits -10% for the day (the furthest they can push it by shorting on downticks) as close to the Citron announcement as possible, with the hopes that that livestream will then push retail shorters to short more or paper-handers to sell. Remember, due to puts expiring Friday, there is likely significant pressure on shorters to drive price below $35 or as close as they can asap.

Option 3: Small but steady downward pressure, in the hopes of making retail investors get bored and leave so that the stock price goes down.

Gamestop will also announce an influx of new consoles sometimes tomorrow. This helps push stock up, and I bet they time it to be right before Citron's twitter live if they can, and my personal hope is that there's something unexpected about this influx of new consoles (perhaps a larger number than usual due to a new deal?), but I don't expect this to have a super huge effect.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Citron might have good points, but they'll leave out a lot. Find the real scoop above, and don't let them manipulate you into selling if they or their funders time some share dumps to go with their stream.  💎🙌",2021-01-21 04:56:42
$NIO could be at a great “buy the dip” level,0.83,"NIO hit a high of $67 before dropping to $54-$57 area, there is a load of supply around the $50-40 zone so its very unlikely for NIO to fall any lower.

NIO’s market cap is still only at 90B, it has so much room left to grow. 

EV’s are expected to grow exponentially as fewer gas vehicles are produced every year

NIO’s EV delivery numbers are growing exponentially and doubling year after year

The craze over EV’s is still growing as more people gain interest in them over gasoline, and current enthusiasts are hoarding the stock

NIO’s earnings have been growing consistently

NIO still holds a buy/hold rating among most analysts

Currently NIO is trading a nice percentage below its ATH’s leaving some nice room to fill up again soon

I’m new to writing these posts, so I hope I did well enough.

Some things I would like to mention is that 2020 recovery gains were also assisted by stimulus checks but we know those won't keep coming in forever. So my guess is that we will have a correction probably late 2021. We will see how wrong I am in a few months.

GME - 10 days left to 🚀🚀juice🚀🚀 earnings,0.97,"Calling all autists.  GameStops Q4 ends January 30th which means there are 10 days left to juice their earnings.  Based on the [2020 holiday sales report](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results) they released a few days ago, we know there were highlights. 4.8% YoY increase in same store sales. 309% YoY increase in e-commerce sales.

While we wait for Short Interest Info,0.98,"My initial post wasn't showing up on the page because I believe it had too many words. I wanted to write some points toward why GME is going to fly to the moon regardless of the short squeeze. If you're not a gamer then maybe this will provide some insight. 

Gamestop has been moving away from physical sales in a big way and I believe there are a few things happening in the gaming industry that Ryan Cohen sees as priceless. 

**My overall point: Ryan Cohen isn't buying Gamestop to just drive E-Commerce. RC wants to turn Gamestop into the most beloved Gaming Culture company on the planet.** 

Gaming is a huge industry. As a matter of fact, it's the largest entertainment industry in the world. 180 Billion tendies big and it's growing at such a fast rate it's expected to almost double by 2025. Gamestop is already positioned as one of the most recognizable gaming brands but they are known for not having quality customer service. RC has spoken a lot about how Customer Service and brand loyalty is his primary focus. If he can accomplish this, Gamestop will not have competition in the gaming industry in 5 years. I'm going to make the following points succinct.

1) MSFT and GME have a deal for revenue share. It is reported that Gamestop also has something similar with Sony.

2) Scalpers have ruined new console and PC parts sales for everyone. Inventory shortages are a real problem and Gamestops partnerships are a big part of solving this. here's why: I believe that Gamestop is organizing deals that not only revenue share, but also give them inventory priority. Want to buy the new Xbox? Go to Gamestop. Want to buy the new AMDs? Go to Gamestop.

3) PC Build a Centers - This concept supports my statement in number 2. If Gamestop has a build a PC center arrangement, I would bet my money (and I quite literally have) that Gamestop is arranging inventory priority on the new chipsets and GPUs. It would not surprise me to see GME make deals with Intel and/or AMD to make this happen.

4) Culture - ESports and Streaming are a huge hit. There are 140 Million unique visitors to Twitch on a monthly basis. They have arenas dedicated to ESports that get SOLD OUT. Imagine Gamestop hosting (successfully) local tournaments at their newly refreshed centers. Gamers will recognize Gamestop as an ally to the culture, not just a retailer. 

5) Subscriptions - Here's where the MSFT deal is bigger than I think it's being talked about. MSFT did something interesting with their next-gen consoles. They had a deal where you paid 24.99 a month for 2 years for the new console and got a Gamepass subscription included. 

6) Gamestop has talked about creating a digital trade-in platform Which would be huge in the gaming industry. I personally own at least 2K worth of digital games I haven't played in years and can't get rid of. 

Combine all of my points and I believe RC is looking to partner Gamestop's Power Up Rewards with MSFT Gamepass, along with some form of digital trade-in platform. Subscriptions are profitable.  Gamestop and MSFT partnership is fucking massive. Imagine Gamestop's ECommerce platform being the main medium that Microsoft uses for game purchases and trade-ins. PC game sales through MSFT store, Xbox store, all run on Gamestops platform. They Rev share all digital purchases and trade-ins and MSFT uses Gamestops physical locations to push their PC sales. 

Sorry for the wall of text but this where my head at. I'm a fucking nerd I get it but Gamestop is known by every single gamer. If they can position themselves as part of the culture and not a blood-sucking retailer, it's game over for the competition. 

I believe Ryan Cohen can accomplish this.",2021-01-21 01:18:25

Lately i've been pretty busy with gme and i haven't been able to follow the upcoming bb hype. I've been trying to find what caused the sudden hype but i can't seem to find it really.

 I know that they've pivoted away from phones to software for self driving cars, but i assume this has been known for quite a while. I also know they settled a suit with FB, but i wouldn't expect something like that to trigger this much hype. So why the sudden change in popularity? And what is the bull case for it that suddenly made the stock such a compelling choice to invest in?

Gamma Watch of Popular Tickers 1-20-2021 Roundup,0.87,"Due to the growing size of the sub, we've been causing more gamma squeeze events on stocks - GME last week, BB Monday.

Gamma is an option term. What it means in this context is the amount of stock someone short the options would need to buy or sell to hedge their position as price moves.

For WSB popular stocks, I believe that about 2/3 - 3/4 of all options were sold by dealers to you degenerates, which means that the dealer is now ""short gamma"", which is not a superhero movie involving dwarves.

That means that as prices move, dealers have to madly buy or sell stocks in the direction of the price movement so as not to lose money, because option dealers/market makers ALWAYS win (almost). This means that in some situations, moving over a ""gamma ramp"" (price where there's a lot of gamma) may be many times easier than in areas without a lot of gamma. This in turn makes a ""gamma squeeze"" where dealers are forced to buy or sell stock so as to not lose money (similar to short squeeze, which is when shorts are forced to buy, causing yet more buying, so as to not lose more money).

In most cases, gamma is not a meaningful effect on a stock, close to zero. But it can be a big deal. In BB's case, I think as much as 2/3 of the stock bought on Monday was dealers, and the weak rally today is evidence of that - no gamma ramp. GME is similar - passed a huge gamma ramp to get to the 30s last week (with dealers doing 2/3 of the buying), now kind of in between several gamma ramps, with dead zones 36-38 and 31-34.

Looking at gamma can help you guys understand what price actions are possible. It's a giant lever that can go against you or for you. If price is slightly above a gamma ramp, it's bearish because small amounts of selling can crash the price quickly. If the price is slightly below a gamma ramp, it's bullish, because small buying can cause the price to run up the ramp, while your downside is insulated by little forced selling by the dealers.

Note that when you buy NEW options from dealers, they just do the trade you do initially - buy a put, they sell stock. Buy a call, they buy stock. But from there, price moves cause them to match the stock price movement - they remove some of their short when price goes up and they sold you a put, and they enlarge their long when the price goes up and they sold you a call. Make sense? Thought not, work on your reading comprehension guys if you are trading complex derivatives with your life savings.

Keep in mind that in a lot of cases, there's no meaningful gamma, and no price action will occur.

I prepared today gamma outlooks on some of the most mentioned stocks - GME, BB, PLTR, ICLN,TSLA TLRY, NIO. Note that this tool ([http://www.tradingvolatility.net/](http://www.tradingvolatility.net/)) assumes that calls are long gamma for dealers, and puts are short gamma. I think when you guys engage a stock, it's more like 3/4 of all gamma is short gamma, put or call.  Thetagang shows up and gives them some long gamma.

Current popular stock gamma landscapes (IMGUR has been a bit wonky lately... hopefully its loading):

[https://imgur.com/a/1IrWNln](https://imgur.com/a/1IrWNln)

Gamma is only relevant relative to float. Big gamma matters more on small stocks. You will form your own opinions and trade accordingly, and if this sub lately is any indication, you'll read ALL information as UBER BULLISH for the stock you YOLOed on. But here are my interpretations coldly reading the data:

**GME** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Relevance: Very high - Big swings could cause MM's to buy/sell 1/3 of floating shares easily.

Reading: Somewhat bearish with bearish trend especially right above $40, but possibility of strong bull case on good bid. There is a LOT of gamma ramp, and looking at the picture, we are more 'on top' of the gamma than ""on bottom"" of the gamma. It turns out that the bears favor the ""on top"" position w/ regards to gamma. People have added a lot of bearish bets in the past few days in the form of puts under this price, which are fuel for the fire down, and can be seen in the graph as put positions. A lot more gamma ramp on net below than above. Bulls should be secure if this stock can get to the low 40s and stay there. If it starts moving down, it will run fast and then slow down at 36/37, then slow down again at 31/32/33.  Good news is that because of all this new put vol, the price action will be less naturally down in the base case as dealers dump their hedges as time goes forward, pushing price up gradually.

**BB** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Relevance: High. Big swings could cause MMs to buy/sell 1/3 of floating shares.

Reading: Bearish, with bullish trend. This was arguably bearish yesterday because we were at the top of a ramp. Since then, peopl ehave establsihed a lot of new positions beginning to form a bullish ramp. Bad news can send this back to 10 quickly, but not much lower quickly. Accumulation of new calls should start to make moving up a possibility though if people keep buying.

**PLTR** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Relevance: Moderate. Float is theoretically a billion shares, and swings could make MMs buy/sell perhaps 1/4 to 1/5 of that.

Reading: Slightly bullish. There's a sharp ramp down, but also up.. and  a strong buying trend will move this up, and there's large block of gamma at $30.

**ICLN:** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Relevance: Low. Why? Because this is an ETF that can be made/destroyed by issuer on demand.

Reading: Actually a little bullish. This is so much gamma ahead of price that it will cause a couple hundred million dollars of clean energy buying on a decent day. I know, weird?

**TSLA:** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

As usual a gamma monster, hard to read. 750m float shares.

Relevance: Lowish. Not that much gamma compared to float.

Reading: Bullish. Most of the gamma is above current price.

**TLRY:** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Huge OI on this one. 136m shares avail. Nearby gamma is something like 50m.

Relevance: High to very high. Maybe 1/3 or shares could turnover in some situations.

Reading: A bit bullish. Kind of in the middle of it all. Stock could move up fast on good buying pressure and get to low 20s on gamma.

**NIO:** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Relevance:  Moderate to ""almost moderate"". It's something like 20% of float near price in hedging obligations in aggressive cases.

Reading: Bullish. Gamma mostly above current price.

&#x200B;

**My relevant positions:**

No positions on most of these.

Short GME on puts.

Long BBBY on calls, but didn't do the gamma chart of it here. It's at the bottom of a gamma ramp: **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

You likely remember that from 2012 to 2018, New Jersey fought a public court battle for its right to legalize sports betting. In May 2018, the Supreme Court finally ruled in favor of the state, giving birth to a multibillion-dollar industry virtually overnight.

Today, 19 states (and Washington, D.C.) have already begun allowing sports betting, and six more have legalized (but not yet implemented) it. Because each state is building its own framework, there are significant regulatory differences between them.

Complicating matters further, most states only issue sportsbook licenses to casinos and racetracks. This makes some sense, but the real benefits of sports betting come from mobile and online betting, not from people going to casinos.

As former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie wrote in a 2019 opinion piece in the *Detroit News* (emphasis added)...

>What's to account for our success in New Jersey? New Jersey is the only state with full mobile access for sports fans and a robust competitive marketplace for gaming operators.We allow customers to conveniently register to bet on their phones and bet from anywhere in the state because we are aware of a simple reality: People do everything on their phones these days.

And the evidence backs this up... In the first year of New Jersey sports betting, 83% of bets came from online wagers. So how are the casinos and racetracks handling this new venture? By finding partners with experience running mobile and online gaming, like GAN.

GAN's software gives customers real-time control of all facets of online operations, including promotions, messaging, analytics, and processing bets and transactions. GAN's biggest customers are land-based casinos and racetracks. Notable customers include Penn National Gaming (PENN), Churchill Downs (CHDN), and Wynn Resorts (WYNN), among many other casinos.

GAN is primarily a Software as a Service (""SaaS"") business with two main sources of income...

1. Fees its customers pay for its technology suite and related services.
2. A variable cut of its customers' gaming revenues.

GAN also occasionally sees large, one-time lumps of revenue for licensing a casino loyalty patent it owns.

The market loves the ""sticky"" SaaS model because it brings in recurring revenue, meaning customers tend to renew year after year. SaaS companies also boast high margins and are capital efficient. Our expectation is that most, if not all, of GAN's major contracts will expand geographically as its customers continually move into newly legalized jurisdictions.

In November 2020, GAN announced an agreement to acquire a company that may have been the last missing piece of its offering. It's buying the parent company of European online gaming platform Coolbet for about $175 million. This gives GAN a ""best-in-class sportsbook engine"" – in other words, the people and technology to set lines, manage risk, and generally run a sportsbook.

With Coolbet, GAN will now be able to offer a full turnkey, managed sportsbook to its casino customers. This puts GAN's offering on equal footing with its major competitors from a product breadth and depth standpoint, and will also allow GAN to capture more and more wallet share from its customers.

Yes, we can profit if GAN is bought out by a deeper-pocketed customer, like a casino or burgeoning daily fantasy sports companies FanDuel or DraftKings (DKNG). But as with our other potential acquisition targets, the real opportunity would be for GAN to remain independent.

In a gold rush, a given prospector may or may not get rich... but a company selling ""picks and shovels"" will always prosper. GAN is a picks-and-shovels play on mobile betting. It's already realizing huge revenue growth, and less than half the country has even begun taking bets. As the rest of the U.S. wakes up to the tax and job-creation opportunities that legal sports betting offers, GAN will be among the first to profit.

It's quite clear to me and probably everyone here beforehand that this is really starting to pick up steam outside /r/wallstreetbets.

Most of you longer holders probably roll your eyes at the ever-increasing autistic and retarded comments and questions appearing in the daily thread like:

>i just bought at $44 when 2 sell?!?!?!?!  
>  
>gonna take out 10k margin to buy!!!  
>  
>omg i bought at the high and now its $36 im gonna selll!!!!  
>  
>too late to buy???!?!

# Oh boy...

Let's go through a beginners Q&A:

***WTF IS HAPPENING IM FROM*** /r/ALL ***PLS HELP I WANT MONEYYYYY*** 🤑🤑💰💰

I could fill up this entire thread with a long answer but here is a ***VERY MAJORLY*** dumbed down version for retards to understand:

* Gamestop (GME) is hated by big money companies, companies want GME to die
* Investors say: ***n o***
* GME has solid foundation, big money investors continue to buy stock
* GME catches on /r/wallstreetbets as a meme stock
* /r/wallstreetbets realize that GME is no meme stock at all
* [Ryan Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen), founder of multi-billion dollar company [Chewy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewy_(company)), INVESTS HEAVILY into GME, then becomes a fucking BOARD MEMBER and brings his buddies in to save GME from dying
* everyone on /r/wallstreetbets has week-long erections and continues to pour money into GME up to this day

So **a lot** of people have been buying and **HOLDING** GME stock in hopes of the company's future prospects and/or a SHORT-SQUEEZE, [what is a short-squeeze?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRyWZ6CXqM)

***TOO LATE 2 BUY???*** 🤔 🤔 🤔

Absolutely not, regardless if you're short-term (few days/weeks) or long-term (few months/years), it is looking like a pretty good time to jump in

***OMG IT DROPPED $4 I HAVE TO SELL!!!***   🌈🌈🌈

*Stop.*

If you're SPENDING MONEY on GME, you should understand it WILL HAVE BIG FLUCTUATIONS. If you're the type of person to write this comment, please educate yourself and [read this excellent analysis on the GME stock itself.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/)

tldr: dont sell holy shit u fucking retard just hold💎🙌 and you have the potential of selling at ludicrous prices later

***IM GONNA TAKE OUT ROBINHOOD MARGIN TO BUY MORE HUEHUEHU IM GREEDY AF*** 😈😈😈

Shorters (big bad companies) can ""borrow"" your margin stock to climb themselves out of the real bad hole they're in. If you buy with cash, they **cannot.**

You are literally working against yourself and the entire community if you buy stocks on margin.

***OK DEN ILL DO OPTIONS???***

No. The only thing putting pressure on companies who are shorting are **SHARES.**

Again, you are hurting yourself and the cause if you buy anything but shares.

***WHEN IS SHORT SQUEEZE?!!? HOW DO I TIME IT???? PRICE TARGET??!?!?*** *🐑🐑🐑*

Nobody knows for sure. All we know is that companies that are shorting GME stock are losing **b i g m o n e y** as GME stock continues to stay this high, and they'll thwart and prevent it as best as they can before they eventually give in.

Historically, big short squeezes last anywhere from a full day to a full week. Please refer to the [VW Squeeze](https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/) and/or the [TSLA Squeeze.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/147768239357820929/801235457153302599/bbfbe8f8d0.png) These things don't happen within a few minutes people, you have time.

Price targets in the short term are very tricky to pin down. [Here's a very well done analysis](https://www.gmedd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GMEdd-GameStopValuation-20Jan21.pdf) of potential LONG-TERM estimates by our friend /u/Uberkikz11. As for short term squeeze price target? Most of the retard sentiment here is ***hoping*** for a squeeze anywhere from $300 to $1000, again very hard to pin down.

# COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT GME

**Gamestop has added 6k+ new jobs up for listing!**

[Debunked](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l00o7e/gamestop_posts_thousands_of_new_jobs/gjqy92q/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), HOWEVER they are adding a [few particular jobs that weren't there before](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/komelh/gme_careers_as_a_reflection_of_their_roadmap/), meaning while they aren't hiring 7k new people, they're adding positions that make this new transformation that much more sexy

**WE CONTROL THE MARKET@@!!!**

Yeah, WSB is definitely quite a sizeable chunk and [probably owns just under 10% of GME shares now](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6jjm3/wsb_owns_58_of_gme_gme_survey_update/) but you have to remember, there is big money involved. [GME is owned by a lot of institutions that have way more power than WSB does.](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings)

I know, I know, autist together = stronk but let's not get *too* ahead of ourselves and pretend we can make GME blast off on a moments notice. We DO have power, just stop being mega-autistic about it.

**GME GONNA HIT $1000 LIKE VOLKSWAGEN AND ITS GONNA HAPPEN TOMORROW**

You know, I was leaning towards GME squeezing VW-esque for a fair bit as well [(although I was skeptical)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyn0nz/should_you_buy_gme_shortsqueezes_and_the/)

However I'm *really* convinced this is going to take a fair bit more time, weeks to months for anything resembling a squeeze. With more data coming in, GME really does seem like it's being set up for a [TSLA-esque squeeze](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/147768239357820929/801235457153302599/bbfbe8f8d0.png) and hell tbh I'm hoping that it does do that instead. ***I mean look at that shit***

**SET LIMIT SELL ORDERS....? OR DON'T??**

There's tons of speculation on whether if setting limit high limit sell orders (420.69, 694.20) actually makes it so your broker can lower that shit and kind of forcibly sell your stock.

I don't know about you, but personally I'm watching this shit constantly so I'm not setting limits at all but I'm actually not too sure which advice is good to follow, maybe it depends on the broker as well?

~~Will edit, please correct me if you have the answer.~~

edit: check comments, still am not personally sure about limit sell orders.

again, checking this stock once/twice a day is good enough to not set limits at all.

Your Next Ticket to Tendietown: Mortgage-Backed Securities 🚀,0.26,"After reading this DD, feel free to call up the mortgage broker or originator in your family and get excited take this ride to riches, bitches.

Anyone who is familiar with MBS's might be thinking, that's a boomer play - ""I want my money to pop!"" Let me explain what has happened this last year and how that has affected specific stocks, ETF's and bonds (yes I said the thing boomers get off to).

If you are familiar with GSE's like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, and so on, you know that rates have been suppressed by the feds for the last year and people have either gone into forbearance on existing mortgages or have been refinancing or buying homes like crazy to get these excessively low rates. Now those in forbearance are getting jobs and coming out to refinance before rates go back up because they inevitably will.

Now onto MBS's; if you find the right ones, you're looking at 10x returns over the next 2 years (slower than your GME but still a beautiful return). Which ones are the right ones? Let me share some of the ones I have been looking at and the ones I am loading up on and in what way, because these plays are very specific depending on your choice. 

Ultimately you want an MBS that has been buying up lots of Ginnie Mae and they likely also have been buying up other GSE's as well. It's quite simple what happens now that democrats have control (traditionally rates are higher) as well as an inevitable stop to keeping rates down. Rates go up, so do these types of picks, as they are now collecting heavily on those increases.

If you look up RC as an example, you see that since rates have been low, so has this pick also. GIGB, GSST, and MBB are more logical plays than this, only that these companies have not been down like other MBS picks. You can hunt your own down using the Mortgage-Back Securities criteria, as it really doesn't matter because all will be up. If there is a play you think WSB should focus on then say so in the comments and we can get it upvoted. I personally like the potential gains on RC.

My play would be to buy ITM call options with as high of delta you can afford as far out as you can. Most MBS tickers only have options out till September but I imagine the uptick will still be significant enough in those 6-9 months as it would in 2-3 years. Any MBS will do, but I’m favoring RC and another (banned ticker) just because of the greater upside potential.

TLDR: Mortgage-back securities plays like RC will pop in the next two years as rates go back up

Edit: it’s apparent a lot of you idiots don’t know shit about lending and base your knowledge from on the big short. I’m talking about Government-Sponsored Enterprise like Ginnie Mae. Imagine good loans (not subprime using options ARMs like in the movie) that Uncle Sam will keep floating like a JPowell printer.",2021-01-20 20:44:14

$GME Questions/discussion about Citron stream and potential Uptick Rule creating a gap up Friday before closing,0.9,"To everyone who pointed out that I’m an idiot. Thank you.

Basically if $GME drops -10% tomorrow; due to Citron’s stream, I have some questions about what would happen.

Questions (on mobile and it’s hard to research):

1) If we hold above $39 today and then the citron attack drops it by -10% tomorrow; closing above $35. This would in turn reinstate the uptick rule going into Friday and the $35 shorts/puts would begin to, ideally, cover their losses by buying in, correct?

2) if 1 is correct then the 35s buying in, to cover, plus us buying into the dip would hopefully push it to $40 forcing the 40 shorts/puts to cover as well; since everything is expiring for them on Friday. Assuming this is all accurate then we should see a big spike Friday toward end of day as everyone is forced to cover? This could lead into potentially starting, or setting up, the squeeze for next Monday/ Tuesday since the $45 is the last big gamma step we need to break. 

If this is inaccurate feel free to point out, again, that I am an idiot. I’m just looking for insight and to discuss this further.

"GME from a squeeze perspective on Wednesday 1/19 trading day, not long term DD perspective.",0.96,"
First off, this is not financial advice. This is just observations which I have on the current situation. Do not trade or make decisions about these observations. 

Looking at today’s trading day, was going to be what I think was the real test to see how much longer a squeeze could take. I don’t know the exact timing but here are some observations that I observe. 

The SEC rule 201 was lifted today. Which means the shorts had an opportunity to drive the price down as much as they could. There wasn’t a significant drive down as of today by 2:52pm. This makes me believe one of two thing:

1) Yesterday’s reports that there are no more shares to short are true. Which makes be believe that the shorts also took a long position at some point to hedge against to much upward loss. Which, if you have that kind of money in play is both smart to do and feasible. So now, they are burning through those shares to make us run out of steam and give up. I think this because if you look at volume spikes today, the stock goes up at significant increased volume spike and then slowly goes down from there. It looks like they are trying to match the buys and sells so the stock price stagnant. I don’t know how much stocks they have long to be able to do this but around half of the days volume has to be a sell if the price is somewhat flat. That’s a significant amount of shares if that’s the case. So who actually knows how much inventory they have less. My assumption is not many. In this scenario, it’s just a matter of time until they run out of steam if stocks continue to be purchased or people hold the shares. 

2) They still have available shares to short and we just don’t know it. Even though we have the reports that there aren’t any, there’s a chance that they are wrong. Because today is flat, means they didn’t use all the short shares available. This makes me think that they are going to try to get the price to go down tomorrow as a coordinated attempt during or after the Shitron live Twitter event. What they will try and do is spook the retail investors who don’t have the guts for volatility to sell at the same time, then they use the rest of the available short shares, and maybe sell the rest of their long shares ALL at the SAME TIME. That will spook other people and then a mass sale happens driving the price of the stock down. To me this could be a very real threat. Not sure what to do in this scenario, but I’m sure somebody who is much, much more experienced than me knows how to navigate (please please please comment below). I would assume that the longs need to know not to sell no matter what happens and rally one last time and buy up the rest of the shares. Hopefully, management knows this threat and also has a plan of their own.

Further thought of the situation, I think the shorts were forced to come up with some kind of PR that’s going to scare people. If they didn’t do that and then colluded together without that event, it would be deliberate market manipulation. But if they can piggyback on retail selling out, they can get away with pulling an all out attack. 

Luckily, for retail, they did give us a heads up of an event which gives retail the time to come up with its own plan on how to defend. 

Retail can do what everybody has been saying, don’t sell. Also, as shareholders and now there is a lot of you, you can suggest that GameStop corporate come up with a strategy as well or ask them to release some more info on their plans for the future and such. GameStop already has a bunch of press right now and some sorta news can be really good to combat what could happen tomorrow. As a public company they have to have its investors in its best interest. Since a short seller is not technically an investor yet (they haven’t physically bought shares like all of us) we might be able to nudge corporate in the right direction. Maybe send an email or give GameStop corporate a call and ask nicely for some news tomorrow. 

Game stop investor relations phone number: 817-424-2001.

Yet another GME yolo - 4000 shares,0.98,"Previously profited 80k on GME January22 and July21 20Cs. Sold those last Thursday. Today, sold my earlier debit spreads from AMZN and APPL (both super green today) to combine profit and switch to GME shares. Was hoping for a bigger dip from Citron today but I guess the inauguration snuck up on everyone.

Personally, this is easily a 75-80 stock in the next year - squeeze or no squeeze. Lots of negative and positive hyperbole out there, but just trust your positions and sit tight for a while. As someone else mentioned, for the people who bought at 4 and it dropped 50%, do you think they are glad they stuck it out? Winners block out the noise and stay focused. Log out of your apps if necessary.

One Solid Gamma Squeeze Candidate post-GME,0.78,"Lately I've seen a lot of posts from ya'll looking for the next Gamma Squeeze, because even though GME is pretty epically set up, it can't be the ONLY one, right?

I have searched and found a candidate that offers some real Gamma Squeeze potential. Allow me to set out the case for MAC and please feel free to add commentary if you have any: this is exploratory.

MAC

Macerich is an owner of high class malls, owning 10 A++ rated malls, and 18 A+ or A rated malls. This means that of the 47 total properties they own, over half of them are A++ or A+/A malls.

Why does this matter? When it comes to malls, consumers tend to flock to the highest rated. A++ malls believe it or not make up 28% of all Mall revenue in the country while only comprising 4% of total malls.

In an environment where malls are thought to be dying, this is an important factor to account for. While many malls will be closed down, the best malls will likely further expand this already sizeable marketshare.

MAC is a debt risk, with 1.8 billion worth of debt maturing in 2021. However, MAC's debt is non-recourse debt, which means they can basically give the keys to any distressed property back to the bank with no penalty to the company.

Now, so far this has just been an ""investment thesis"" for MAC, but the Gamma Squeeze angle is where it gets interesting.

Currently, MAC has 150 million shares outstanding, but the float is only 91.5 million. Of that float, 88.16% are currently sold short.

With a current share price of $14.50, MAC is trading below book value of $16.50. Simon Property Group, for contrast, is trading at 17x book value. If MAC were to be bought out, they would be bought out for a premium on book value of conservatively 3x (literally just taking the SPG premium and assigning MAC \~1/5 of that number in a potential buyout), and that would instantly make MAC shares worth $49.50.

I bring up the likely sale price of MAC to show just how badly undervalued this stock is relative to its intrinsic value. Currently 88% of the shares are sold short, and there are plenty of reasons to turn these sellers into buyers scrambling to close their positions.

So that's it, high short interest on a stock that is trading below book value while competitors are trading at 17x book value, whose biggest concern is debt load but could be bought out at an extreme premium and also has non-recourse debt which favors the debtor.

Class action against Citron?,0.93,"Massive plays right before tweets from market movers must at least be investigated.

Citron tweeted when GME was shooting up to $45.  There was a huge run-up to it, and it looked like the squeeze was starting.  Then this:

https://twitter.com/therealYuriM/status/1351840403033620481

If they made a massive put/short play right before the tweet, then they knew by tweeting that the stock would then drop enough for them to profit enough to at least offset losses on other short positions, as well as give a way out for other shorts and stanch their bleeding.  I don't believe they're doing this based on any due diligence, that it's blatant market manipulation, even without collusion.

[EDIT] SEC complaint form here: https://www.sec.gov/complaint/select.shtml  Thank you, /u/No-Blackberry-1089  I filed a complaint, and everyone is free to use what I entered as a template for their own complaint:  https://ibb.co/CW1js3v

They tweeted at a too-convenient time for the shorts.  I believe their thesis isn't based on any due diligence.  Even if there wasn't private collusion, a massive play by a market maker right before that market maker tweets is textbook manipulation.  There should at least be an investigation to see who made plays, and why the timing was so good.

Most importantly, our due diligence was *thorough* and ***public***.  Let's get the SEC to crack open Citron's CompuServe email and AOL chats to see what due diligence they have done, if any, before tweeting. If instead they find a page from Cramer saying ""tweet the intertubes!"" then Citron will at least get fined and it'll show the crooked side of Wall Street that a public, ethical hivemind can fight back, will fight back, and can win.

I posit that we can't be hanged for manipulation because of the public nature of our discussions.  If they come after us, they'd have to go after *all of finance journalism.*  They can't.  That's free speech.  Both sides of the aisle will fight for that right.

I'm long on GME.  I'm going to profit no matter what the bears say because I believe wholeheartedly in new leadership that they'll adopt and execute a new, better strategy and that the stock price will recover.  I publicly posted DD (which I then deleted because nobody said anything about it, ~~I can repost if people are interested~~ [EDIT] [DD here](https://old.reddit.com/r/runningAndJumping22/comments/l1egkw/gme_dd_background_and_experience_of_new_leadership/)).  I did my homework.  Tons of other people also posted really high-quality DD for everyone else here to read.  I don't need the squeeze to happen to make money here, and neither does anybody else here.

***I propose a publicly-funded lawsuit to investigate source and timing of market plays as well as private collusion. Any awards are to be used to restore donors their donations, lawyers are paid, and the remainder distributed to the plaintiffs.***

"VSTO - Ammo Price to the Moon, Safe Easy 2-4 bagger",0.87,"While we wait for PLTR to break out of its wedge between 20-30, I wanted to showcase a company with some very strong near-term catalyst coming.

Vista Outdoor is the largest ammo maker in America with the acquisition of Remington's ammunition. As some of you know, ammo prices have gone exponential over the past year, with ammo prices going up 2-3x in some cases and continuing to climb higher.  Currently about 60% of VSTOs revenue is driven by ammunition, they own Federal, American Eagle, Remington (acquired in Nov) and Speer. VSTO currently has about 40% of the entire US ammunition market. Of the other major players, Hornady is private and Winchester is a smaller business segment of Olin.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sjw0cwkg8fc61.png?width=831&format=png&auto=webp&s=477744759d8941e9b2b1b693ec0c800ef0af24fb

So why does this matter? VSO share price had been falling since 2016 because of the Trump win in 2016, as a result, pricing on ammo and firearms dropped significantly from 2017-2019. This all changed with Covid-19 and the election of Joe Biden. While there is no data on firearms sales due to prohibition on a national registry for firearms, background checks serves as a good correlation for the number of guns sold as the majority of gun sales go through a background check. The number is up 60% YOY in 2020 from 2019. The FBI completed 39.7 million background checks in 2020, this means at least 40 million guns were sold in 2020 (it could be higher as you could buy two guns with one background check).

https://preview.redd.it/c1izzcvkafc61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=69ef284674000d6b7a477e1fdc11c69e6847f0c0

This has led to unprecedented demand for ammo. Ammo demand increased by 150% alone just in H1 2020

[https://www.nssf.org/first-time-gun-buyers-grow-to-nearly-5-million-in-2020/?hilite=%27139%27%2C%27percent%27%2C%27ammunition%27](https://www.nssf.org/first-time-gun-buyers-grow-to-nearly-5-million-in-2020/?hilite=%27139%27%2C%27percent%27%2C%27ammunition%27)

Due to massive shortages, ammo prices have literally been shooting up to the moon. For example, quality hallow-point 9mm ammo could be had for about USD0.35/round back in late 2019.

[https://www.sgammo.com/catalog/pistol-ammo-sale/9mm-luger-ammo](https://www.sgammo.com/catalog/pistol-ammo-sale/9mm-luger-ammo)

today, the same ammo costs upwards of USD1.4/round today, up nearly 4x in a year.

Manufacturers are facing unprecedented backorders. VSTO has mentioned in earning calls that they have USD1 billion in backorder for ammunition which would take 3-4 years to fill even if demand falls back to pre-covid levels. This means simply insane growth and margins that will come through over the next several years.

Now we get to valuations, the company is sitting on around 2.1-2.3 billion in normalized sales (about 60% from ammo), growing at 30% on a YoY basis which is still lagging because the Remington acquisition took place in November. Net Income for the company was USD60 million in the Sep quarter and is expected to be a blow-out in the Dec quarter, I am expecting somewhere around 80-100 million. If current trends hold for the next 4 quarters, the company will deliver around 400-500 million of Net Income. The company currently has a market cap of USD1.6 billion, which would give it a forward PE of 3x. During the Obama years, the stock was trading at 11x PE, and that was before you added about 8 million new gun owners, with more expected in the next 12 months.

This stock will easily be in the 40-50 in the next few months and 60-70 in a year and the Q4 earnings in Feb 4 will be a key catalyst.

Now lets talk about risks. People are obviously worried that there could be a ban on the sale of ammo. This would be shot down pretty quick by Scotus, I invite you to read Jackson v City of SF from the 9th Circuit Court (one of the least second amendment friendly lower courts)

[https://casetext.com/case/jackson-v-city-of-sf](https://casetext.com/case/jackson-v-city-of-sf)

""The Second Amendment protects ""arms,"" ""weapons,"" and ""firearms""; it does not explicitly protect ammunition. Nevertheless, without bullets, the right to bear arms would be meaningless. A regulation eliminating a person's ability to obtain or use ammunition could thereby make it impossible to use firearms for their core purpose. *Cf. Heller….*(holding that ""the District's requirement (as applied to respondent's handgun) that firearms in the home be rendered and kept inoperable at all times … makes it impossible for citizens to use them for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional""). Thus ""the right to possess firearms for protection implies a corresponding right"" to obtain the bullets necessary to use them. *Cf. Ezell…*(holding that the right to possess firearms implied a corresponding right to have access to firing ranges in order to train to be proficient with such firearms).""

As you can see, unless the democrats somehow stack SCOTUS and overturn Heller, ammunition is protected under the second amendment and will continue to be sold for the foreseeable future. Moreso, there are likely over 400 million firearms in America, that is a lot of ammunition (which is a consumable) which will likely be bought in the coming years for those firearms.

**Call Option on Chaos (Alternative to the VIX)**

So again, you guys are all convinced you'll make 10x from calls on GME, PLTR and BB so why bother with this stuff that's maybe a 2-4x. Well, we are all in the game of robots and momentum retail circle jerking each other (TSLA and NIO and we are hoping Palantir) and squeezing shorts (GME), this big bubble could come to a horrendous end if we start seeing real violence showing up in the streets.

Yes the right winged militias and antifa are just punching each other right now, marching around with rifles and plate carriers, and largely LARPING , but it doesn't take much for things to escalate. There are lots of Trump voters who feel like the election is stolen, and the body politics is getting more and more polarized. If a black swan event were to happen, expect ammo price to simply go even more vertical.

The real political VIX is in the price of ammo, and the largest maker of ammo is VSTO. I had been trying to come up with a way to find VIX proxies as rolling OTM VIX calls has a massive carry cost. I think VSTO is essentially a low carry/free VIX call right now, which allows you to take on more risks with other parts of your portfolio.

TLDR: start making bullet farmer memes.

I have about $100k in shares, about 10k in ITM Feb calls to play the earnings.

WallStreetBets Impact on the Market,0.97,"In 2020 retail-investor representation in the stock market surged by 4.7% to a record 19.6%. Spurred by zero-commission trading and COVID tailwinds, this booming segment of stock market traders has reshaped market behavior. 

I've been scraping discussion on WallStreetBets for several months, and tracking how often different tickers are mentioned every day.

The graph below visualizes yesterday's discussion on the forum. Size represents the number of times a ticker has been mentioned, whereas color brightness represents the performance of the stock. GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) had the highest discussion count with 495 mentions and returned 10.89% for the day.

[WSB Heat Map](https://preview.redd.it/48jg1izvjic61.png?width=1119&format=png&auto=webp&s=089b824acc9dcd7f89689c71d661f0d127d164ee)

A quick look at the above graph shows that many of the companies listed have experienced parabolic stock growth and volatility over the last several months. This begs the question: **Has WSB discussion been a leading indicator for stock performance?**

To test this question, I backtested a simple strategy that buys and holds the 5 stocks that were most discussed on WallStreetBets in the previous week. We ran this backtest using data from 2020.

The graph below shows the portfolio holdings by week (click for full-size image):

[WSB Portfolio Holdings](https://preview.redd.it/smkp7dualic61.png?width=1119&format=png&auto=webp&s=c95d1d4bbc1047a2c76b26fbfc3305143dc39d6d)

Tesla, Apple, AMD, Nio, and Microsoft were among the stocks that most frequently cracked the weekly top five most-mentioned tickers.

Over the last year this simple strategy was up over 61%, with especially strong returns in the last quarter of 2020. The ""WallStreetBets Portfolio"" was more volatile than the S&P 500, but outperformed even during the downturn at the start of the year.

&#x200B;

[$WSB Performance](https://preview.redd.it/cc17jspglic61.png?width=1118&format=png&auto=webp&s=df61ec8ce1fc245a93cdb5fced42271e54f20de3)

To take a look at the relationship between WallStreetBets discussion and market activity at a stock-level, I’ve picked a couple stocks that were among the most popular on WSB in the last 120 days and examined them to determine if there is a correlation between WSB discussion and share price and volume.

**Palantir Technologies Inc (NASDAQ: PLTR)**

Big data analytics company, Palantir Technologies Inc, had its highly anticipated IPO on September 30, 2020 trading at $8.20. Shortly after, on October 14, the discussion volume of PLTR tripled to nine counts as well as achieving a 4.65% gain on the day. WSB count and share price activity continue to share a positive correlation coefficient of 0.592 as the stock reached a 52-week high of 33.05 on November 27, 2020. *\[Note: A value of greater than 0.7 is considered a strong correlation. Anything between 0.5 and 0.7 is a moderate correlation, and anything less than 0.4 is considered a weak or no correlation.\]*

&#x200B;

[Palantir Price vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/f8p41x1jkic61.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=2090f0fba5f9ee39cf7f3ed21932d31d6a0e1264)

WSB counts and PLTR volume for the same dates recorded a correlation coefficient of 0.803. This could indicate a large amount of individual-investor interest driving the recent valuation of Palantir which features a low proportion of institutional ownership at 14.41% (3Q20), compared to the industry average.

&#x200B;

[Palantir Volume vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/4qiik9ekkic61.png?width=1354&format=png&auto=webp&s=074100895bb7e99da71462126ed7f972d5763948)

PLTR received three downgrades from investment banks between October and December 2020 but added a price target increase to $30.00 (from $18.00) by Jeffries on January 11, 2021, well above its current price of $25.64. Risks still linger as 2Q20 to 3Q20 EBITDA losses increased by 83% to an $848.1m loss and, as of now, positive investor sentiment continues to support an uptrend.

**GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME)**

GameStop Corp. has experienced financial stress in recent years as the retail trends which had worked in its favor continue to decline globally. Total Liabilities climbed 12.18% to $2.26B from 2Q20 to 3Q20. Before May 5, 2020, WSB activity on GME had been dormant averaging 3.83 counts daily YTD.

Shortly following this, several threads on WSB began to speculate on a GME recovery due to increased gaming activity and a large existing short position of 57 million shares at the time. WSB counts would be amplified after an investment from activist investor and founder of Chewy (NYSE: CHWY), Ryan Cohen.

Since May 5, 2020, GME has rallied 755.33% and WSB discussion counts averaged 55.34 a day making a positive correlation coefficient at 0.688.

&#x200B;

[GME Price vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/g8xj575nkic61.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b458e40d9866fbecbedc224b5679ba885463f5d)

The WSB counts and stock volume also shared a correlation coefficient of 0.628. This was exemplified on November 30, 2020, when stock volume spiked by 31.3m and discussion counts followed suit at 227 for the day.

&#x200B;

[GME Volume vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/3d3xn8dokic61.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=af618e9f2ea29d71d69d86dc1884a44ec42bbf24)

The mainly optimistic speculation of a GME recovery in May on WSB contrasted with most major media outlets at the time, which appeared to focus on store closures due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The rally and enthusiasm behind GME since that time was in stark contrast to many other corporations, 630 of which filed for bankruptcy in 2020 marking a 10 year high.

## Summary

There is no universal method of finding actionable insights when analyzing WSB, but discussion on the forum can serve as a useful estimation of retail interest. Companies that have had exponential growth with help from forums such as WSB are more likely to become transition to an organic growth phase with more institutional investors and less volume. Keeping an eye on rising companies on WSB could help identify an opportunity that many may have overlooked.",2021-01-20 16:36:28

DKNG- this thing is waiting to pop. A while back when it was in the mid 40's i recommended selling 47.50, 50 and 55.00 puts. Most of those were very profitable with the first two hitting max profit. Online gambling in Michigan, texas and New York are bullish for this. Although, NYC revenue is TBD.

Why you should swing to Callaway/Topgolf ($ELY) once the game stops,0.85,"In a bid to keep you retards happy, I’ll keep this short and snappy. I think Callaway/Topgolf ($ELY) has potential to become **the** WSB meme stock. This could be a hole-in-one. This stock is so pun-worthy that its haters will learn to become lovers and together WSB shall unite to show off its big swinging dick in its full glory  **🍆** **🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Jokes aside though, I think $ELY finds itself in an underappreciated growth sector and is well positioned through its recently announced acquisition of Topgolf. Without further ado, here are three reasons I have [YOLO’d my lifesavings into $ELY](https://ibb.co/QDv2bdM) (and before I get called a snake for not being in $GME, I would be if my broker offered it):

**The synergies bro:** With the acquisition Topgolf, Callaway has gained access to a pipeline of innocent, easy-to-deceive newbies that will latch on to the first golf brand that looks even remotely professional. Topgolf venues will be kitted out Callaway merch for newbies to buy and the newbies will duly oblige. It is estimated that 50% of Topgolf’s 13 million annual visitors (which will increase with Topgolf’s expansion into Asia) are non-golfers, so Callaway will be in a strong position if it reel in even a small proportion of these newbies.

**Callaway poised to transform golf:** Callaway has not just bought an entertainment business through its acquisition of Topgolf, but also an incredibly fast growing tech product, Toptracer, that allows amateurs at driving ranges to track the distance, ball speed and curvature of their shots. Toptracer has been rapidly adopted, with installations at driving ranges having grown by a multiple of 16 since it was put on the market in 2017. The room for growth here is massive, with Toptracer technology currently installed in only 7.5k driving ranges out of an addressable market of 650k. Over time, as more of Callaway’s revenue comes from its tech offering, I can see Callaway’s share price increasing just as a result of it being considered more of a tech company.

**And finally, BOOMERS:** I hate how boomers look down at me for being a neckbeard. I live in a small town where boomers cross the street if they see me approaching them. I don’t even look like that much of a degenerate. They just see a young, attractive metrosexual like myself and act as if I’m a skunk. I might be a pot head but that’s beside the point. Fuck’em. I am overdue respect. So where do boomers come into this and why is $ELY an opportunity to get one over boomers? Well, boomers are a key target demographic for the golf sector given they have the time and disposable income to waste all day on a golf course. As the below graph shows, boomers are still maturing, with number of people ages 65+ in the US set to increase for the foreseeable future. I expect $ELY to be a beneficiary of the US’ ageing population. Boomers have fucked us over so we should at least profit from them.

&#x200B;

So there you have it retards – three reasons I have ploughed my life savings into this badboy. If you disagree with me you can kiss my putt. Like a clean hit off tee, $ELY is soon gonna be flying  **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**",2021-01-20 15:41:43

CERS - Mamma Cathie brings the tendies,0.94,"Posted a week or so ago about Cerus Corporation (CERS), a lesser known Cathie pick. She owns a nutload of CERS shares, which she's been reliably scooping up every couple of months by the millions. ARK owns \~11M shares as of the most recent SEC filings. and there are only **149.78M** shares floating of CERS. That means Cathie owns \~7%.

I won't bore you all with a bunch of bullshit like what the company does and what could happen. However, I will tell you that calls are dummy cheap. $20c a few months out are under $40 a contract because this has yet to blow up. So instead of telling everyone about some shit after it runs up 150% I'm bringing this to ya'll now.

But wait, what about GME you say. Well, this is a position I'm using to get extra tendies to put into GME, which currently makes up about 90% of my portfolio. Don't worry, we're all on the same train.

Idk bout you but if Cathie sees something then so do I.

"DD on $FIZZ, possibly next big 🚀 short squeeze",0.64,"Short story for those with ADD:
-Second highest “short to float” ratio to GME
-Higher ratio of shorts to volume than GME
-Low float, moves on air
-well known brand (LaCroix) that is printing money via high/steady profits and is in the process of paying our $250M in special cash dividend

If you missed GME, BB, etc, this may be the next big one





Full DD for those who care:

Posted yesterday about $FIZZ, which has all the ingredients for a short squeeze for the ages. I did some more DD, and am aggregating it here. $FIZZ is the LaCroix sparkling water company, with plenty of other lesser known brands

-short interest of 7.3M shares on a float of 8.8M shares (83%, which is the second highest to $GME among all stocks, as far as I can tell)

-given average volume around 300,000/day, it would take shorts 27 trading days to cover (this is the highest I’ve found, about 5 times what it was for GME before the squeeze
[fizz short interest](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/fizz/short-interest)

-1 person (founder and CEO) owns over 33M shares, and he’s an old Italian guy who hates short sellers (so he’ll never sell, which is the definition of💎🙌)

-late last year they announced a $6/share dividend which is payable in February (remember, shorts have to pay the dividend for any borrowed share because the company only pays the didvidend once per share, while a short share is borrowed and sold, meaning 2 people “own” the same 1 share.)

-recent uptrend in price and volume coincides with the epic $GME squeeze, likely indicating an attempt  by shorts to begin covering. But the total volume of <1.8M the last 3 days wouldn’t even put a dent in the short interest, and we all know that only a fraction of that was shorts covering.

-Company still has over $100M in cash and is hugely profitable
     •33% ROE
     •20% operating margin
     •>$200M operating cash flow
     •44% earnings growth
[fizz financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FIZZ/key-statistics?p=FIZZ)
     •CEO will get $200M CASH from the dividend. I could see him buying another million shares to lock away, further reducing the float and making short covering even harder 

So a profitable, growing business with an old Italian CEO who is angry at short sellers, paying huge dividends, and a potentially even further reduced float. Think about shorts trying to buy back 7M shares from 💎🙌 WSB traders when the days to cover ratio is 27.  Even $GME was “only” about 5-6 (which is a very big number!)

As an added bonus, some chart guys can add to this, but the 3 month MACD Golden cross happened Friday, it is now above 20 and 50 day averages, and probably some other stuff I don’t understand.  😂

I think $GME was the king due to the short interest being higher than the float, but this isn’t far behind, especially given its ability to move large amounts on low volume. The stock is up about 20% the last 3 days on almost no “extra” volume, and given the volume increase the shorts would need to create to cover shares while fighting retail and institutions who see this coming too, this could definitely double, triple, quadruple, who knows. That’s a lot of shares the shorts need to pry from people. And being honest, current holders of stocks like this may not even be the kinds of people that check their portfolio religiously, so you may even see market makers having to sell shares they don’t have to keep an orderly market since there’s not enough liquidity to cover that many short shares, which just adds fuel to the fire. Plus, the dividend and threat of another special dividend has to scare the crap out of them as a double whammy of buying back at a big loss and then paying out CASH to the people you sold to.

I definitely look forward to the smell of burning shorts on this one. 

Good luck if you join me!",2021-01-20 14:52:50

Full GME DCF: Conservative Fair Price $59,0.95,"  

Lot of discouraged GME folks since yesterday's failed launch, so wanted to share my own bullish outlook. Like [u/ucjor](https://www.reddit.com/user/ucjor)'s post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzphxt/gme_dd_fair_value_is_at_least_74share/), I used the most conservative projections, but unlike [u/ucjor](https://www.reddit.com/user/ucjor), I continued the analysis down to the profit streams based on my interpretation of RC's strategic outlook for GME. Sorry for the finance hardo LARP but for those of you who can do math read past the TLDR.

**TLDR considering RC's strategic vision, GME's future profits mean fair value/share is $58.53.** 

 

**Store Closures and Brick & Mortar Revenues**

RC's already said he's disgusted with GME's lack of action in closing stores and expanding ecommerce. Gamestop now plans to close 1000+ stores at the beginning of this year ([source](https://www.thathashtagshow.com/2020/12/09/gamestop-closing-1000-more-stores-by-april)). Since GME leases all their stores on terms of 1-5 years, contracts can easily be dropped as they expire ([source](https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/9d2139e1-31c7-498f-ad95-63db1e6d085a#page=19)). In the following screenshot, I projected the amount of store closures for each year and evenly redistributed the remaining renewed leases to expire over 1-5 years. The results show that with the expiry scheduling, GME will be able to cancel a steady amount of stores every year, reaching below 1500 locations in 2026. 

https://preview.redd.it/epirp2ddxhc61.png?width=881&format=png&auto=webp&s=21b48f37fba9b5cfa16640f636fc5ab06ef947fd

To find brick & mortar revenue, I used the same revenue per store from FY2019, which was an exceptionally poor (but probably realistic) year for GME but not a terrible outlier like 2020, for obvious reasons. While it is likely that in-store sales naturally decline in the near future, I assumed that GME would not close their strongest locations and thus be able to maintain a steady revenue/store. 

**Ecommerce Revenue**

So I said this wasn't a GME circlejerk, but honestly, every good GME DD needs some outlandish assumption. Mine was that GME totally reinvents itself and maintains 5-year revenue growth in-line with e-commerce startups such as Chewy (is this really so outlandish?). Some other assumptions are that COGS holds at \~70.4% (same as LTM) and SG&A holds at \~23.6% (average since 2013). 

https://preview.redd.it/cdtkdg4gxhc61.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c1500bf900feb533ceff6eb88af94141db14d5a

S/O to [u/ucjor](https://www.reddit.com/user/ucjor) for the proxy that I also used for the first year's ecommerce revenue: I took the 9-week holiday sales as 83% of Q4 sales, with 34% of these being attributed to e-commerce.

https://preview.redd.it/72ek3bakxhc61.png?width=485&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf7a0b91464afbb4df21e60492d1221ef22fa905

**Depreciation & CAPEX**

To get my depreciation values, I used the total land owned/leased in Sqft ([source](https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/9d2139e1-31c7-498f-ad95-63db1e6d085a#page=19)) and proxied depreciation by sqft. This meant I could calculate the total D&A after store closures as well as find D&A for distribution centre expansions.  
 

https://preview.redd.it/902ln5smxhc61.png?width=379&format=png&auto=webp&s=750d659d6a721ef2ee91f1c0a9c5c5bc18204d42

To find how much new distribution spaced would be required, I considered Chewy's distribution centre size in comparison to their revenue ([source](https://s23.q4cdn.com/610444331/files/doc_financials/2019/ar/NC10011622x1-CHEWY-INC._10K_2020_V2-Bookproof.pdf)) and used this to find how much space GME would need for each year's projected ecommerce revenue. Additional required space would contribute to CAPEX and the new total space would be depreciated at $8.24 million per million sqft. To get a value for CAPEX, I used Chewy's cost/sqft of distribution space and appreciated this by 2%/year. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ilqroavoxhc61.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7f6c2a3dacef2eb475877e1d4928efa9ea15d7d

**Investment in Working Capital**

Since RC would shift GME to a primarily ecommerce platform, I used comparable ecommerce company turnovers to find GME's working capital account values. I figure GME should be able to achieve these turnover rates after 5 years. 

https://preview.redd.it/hdwu811uxhc61.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=7543f53f91cfa43e63e957f8153fd71cb0f37faf

If you're still with me hang in there - this is the last of it. NOPAT uses EBIT found above, less 35.5% tax (average effective rate since 2013), and D&A, CAPEX, and Delta NWC were found above too. WACC used was 10.6%, considering their 2020 bond issuance at 10%, 8% expected long-term S&P500 returns, and 1.1% 10Y treasury rates. I used a terminal growth rate of 5% since I'm pretty bullish on the video game industry in general.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uekn1vrvxhc61.png?width=180&format=png&auto=webp&s=99dbd8da4332ffa1d95e5517402ffc3b6f053c3a

And as you can see, this brings us a fair price of $58.53/share. Again, I used the most conservative estimates that were still reasonable. If you believe more in multiples, [u/ucjor](https://www.reddit.com/user/ucjor)'s analysis that was similar in revenue projections valued GME at $74/share. Either way the outlook is great, and even if the squeeze doesn't fire, the 🌈🐻 have whatever's coming.

The best part is $FUBO has ALREADY squeezed once before! We saw this fucker go from $26/ share to over $60 in just a few days... All I'm saying is I rode the first rocket ship from $10 to $60 & want you autist included on this next squeeze.

**Additional DD below on Vigtory acquisition:** 

FuboTV Inc. is buying an online sportsbook, a deal that makes the over-the-internet TV provider the latest sports- rich media company to invest in sports gambling in an effort to attract and retain viewers.     

The company said it is in the process of acquiring Vigtory Inc., a sportsbook that it eventually plans to integrate into its TV platform. Vigtory will also be available to those outside of the FuboTV        subscriber base. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.     

In an interview, FuboTV Chief Executive David Gandler said he expects sports wagering to not only generate more revenue for FuboTV but also make it more likely that customers will pay closer attention to sports and tune in more often. The company also recently acquired Balto Sports, a company that develops tools for users to play fantasy sports.     

Sports content tends to be the most expensive on TV, which has led many internet-TV bundles to raise their prices. Over the past year, YouTube TV went from $50 a month to $65 and Hulu +        Live TV from $55 to $65, while FuboTV raised the price of its standard package by $5 to $60        after it added a suite of Disney-owned channels including ESPN.

GME Short Interest update: 70.3M shares short,0.98,"GME SI declined slightly from 71.1M to 70.3M after Jan 19 EOD. Cost to borrow has also declined slightly to 22.9%. I was hoping the shorts to double down(Shitron related) which would result in the cost of borrowing to go up. 

As COB could increase exponentially, it would have been painful for the shorts; even though my hope seems not to be materializing, but whatever, it's still very high. Old shorts seems to be playing it safe.

Citron Research In A Nutshell. $GME holders read.,0.98,"Who the fuck is **Citron Research**? Well here’s a fairly precise not too technical guide as to who the fuck these roaches are, so that the average retard on r/wsb with IQ in the -ve range can understand. Listen, english isn’t my first or my second language, i tried my best, suck it up if it ain’t good enough.

**Citron Research** is a shady as fuck stock commentary website operated by Mr. **Andrew Left**. Now a bit on this autist. In short, Andrew’s a 🌈🐻, in long he’s a self proclaimed “*activist short seller*”. He was married to Ms. Andrea Left, *her username checked out*. His internet newsletter has been running for 17 years now, and apparently has 50 cases in the company’s favor since 2001, do the math and you find out that he can fuckin time travel. Now, there’s a lot of stock commentary websites, newsletters, tv shows and podcasts. Why has Citron Research become such a beacon to attract controversy?  

Why has Citron Research become such a beacon to attract controversy? Well, dear autists, the self proclaimed “*activist*” we’re talking about here, who sees himself as a messiah against corporate fraud and market manipulation is reported by NYTimes as follows : “He can make a killing in a bear market while everyone else on Wall Street suffers.” His methods of investment are rather questionable and has come under much of the financial world’s scrutiny.

Now, fellow autists, this part is very important. **This is his strategy**. Reported by NYTimes once again “After he places a bet against the price of a stock, he then publishes research designed to torpedo the company’s value, often by airing accusations of fraud or abuse. This is entirely legal, as long as what he publishes is not itself fraudulent. Left takes short positions in companies across a whole range of industries.” Keep in mind we are talking about a man that shorted Tesla stock in 2018 and got mad when it didn’t go his way. So mad that he sued Tesla and Papa Elon for stock manipulation. [Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/06/short-seller-andrew-left-files-class-action-lawsuit-against-tesla-and-elon-musk.html). 

SERIOUSLY, THIS DUDE FUCKING SHORTED TESLA AT **$177**, ITS AT **$4,325** TODAY (Pre-Split price). If this wasn’t enough wait to hear the companies in his “*ambitious track record*”. 

Since all of you lack basic correlation skills to connect the dots, let me do it for you fucking losers. What is he doing with GME. Are we not seeing the same pattern here? He is publicly short on GME and is tweeting it. He is known for this kind of manipulation. When he noticed the price had crossed the $43 wall he made it public that he is short GME. He could’ve scheduled the meeting immediately, but no. He scheduled it a day later, now this is perfect for the 🌈🐻 because, he is literally buying time. Buying time when alot of GME holders are in with their life savings on r/wsb. **24 HOURS IS ENOUGH TIME TO SOW THE SEEDS OF DOUBT AND CAUSE PARANOIA TO PEOPLE WITH THEIR LIFE ON LINE. BUT WHAT ARE WE GONA DO? WE ARE GOING TO FUCKING HOLD TO MARS**🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. LATEST UPDATE received states that they chickened out of the livestream that was to be at 11:30AM EST. THEY NEED MORE TIME. THE SHORTS ARE SWEATING. THIS IS WORKING GUYS HOLD.


**SCANDAL #1**. Here’s a notable event on this aucstivist. In 2016, this 🌈🐻 was banned from the Hong Kong stock market for 5 years over a 2012 report on the firm China Evergrande Group as a result of releasing a report containing “false and/or misleading claims” about the above-mentioned company. Forced to pay a little over $720,000 as fines on the profits and legal expenses. He’s on his last string in HK, after his warning, he could end up in jail for violating once again. [Source](https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2038381/hong-kong-bans-short-seller-andrew-left-market-five-years).

**SCANDAL 2**. This guy is what he swore to destroy at this point wait till you read this. Jumia Technologies ($JMIA : NYSE) is an online e-commerce platform founded out of Nigeria in 2012. They gained a fair amount of traction and went public in Apr 2019. It was received very well and rose from around $25 at opening to $41 within a matter of a few weeks. Everything was well until Shitron Research adopted a short position and saw nothing of its potentials. The report came in accusing Jumia of fraud, torpedo’ing the company downwards. It dropped till approx. $2.80. BUT GUESS WHAT, SURPRISE! SHITRON AND ANDICKREW 🌈🐻 said they’re LONG ON THE STOCK. AND THERE’S **NO WAY** THEY’RE SHORTING AGAIN. This man capitalized on the drop of an e-commerce startup out of Nigeria and is now currently benefitting from the uprise. $JMIA sits at $45.56 as of now.

Now these are just 2 scandals that I pointed out because no one on r/wsb seems to be aware of this. Now i’m pretty sure if you’ve been active on the sub you’ve seen the COLOSSAL failures this company has made. I’ll attach it right here. [JUST GO AND SEE THIS ITS IMPORTANT TO GET A PROPER VIEW](https://imgur.com/a/QvKVC9V).

Apart from this, another IMPORTANT info would be that, the live stream where he claimed he is going to expose the top 5 reasons why he’s GME short right now, would PROBABLY be live on his **TWITTER** (@CitronResearch). Hope to see everyone there and I CANNOT WAIT TO PROVE this self proclaimed ~~activist~~ WRONG.

NOW RETARDS KEEP READING BECAUSE, this is not possible without everyone holding tight and buying more 👐👐👐👐💎💎💎💎💎💎. We will be hit badly again, the boomer investors cannot take Citron’s cock out of their mouths, so we expect a sell off, DO NOT GIVE THE BEARS A CHANCE TO BUY. Today could even be a red day, **BUT FEAR NOT**. We will hopefully emerge victorious. I AM SO PROUD OF EVERY LAST AUTIST ON HERE 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.

**NOTE** :

Holding our shares doesnt cost us anything 🤷🏻‍♂️.

The short sellers pay high borrow fees and will eventually get margin called if the price rises further.

A red day doesnt matter at all as we are not selling anyway 💎💎🙌🏼🙌🏼 its just a question of time until the next good news hit and it will explode 🔥🚀

TL;DR : Citron’s been doing this for a long time. The stocks they short do go down only because boomer investors suck them off dry. Time for a revolution. HOLD ON TO YOUR STOCKS WITH DIAMOND HANDS 👐👐👐👐💎💎💎💎💎💎. HOARD AND HOLD. EVEN A RED DAY OR TWO WON’T EXTINGUISH THE FLAME IN WSB. LET US FUCKING TAKE OFF AUTISTS 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.

It's quite clear that they are all scared. And it's impossible for them to cover without booking loss. Call premiums signal that.

They aren't against WSB. They realized people here won't sell. So what's the other way that can exit this position? They are trying to get more short sellers on board that can **take their positions**. And these new people will disproportionately be retail. These companies are not for public good.

I wish there was a way to tell other people who are their followers that they are being led to a slaughter house.

"Investing spreadsheet template, to see all the gains you got on you precious GME stocks",0.84," A week ago I saw someone post their portfolio template, so I thought I'd share mine. I tried to make it as retard-proof as I could, but I'm sure I'm underestimating you guys.

I use my template to see the gains/losses i've made on stock that I have sold.

Some quick info: You will need to copy it to your own google drive. Some functions won't work when downloading to Microsoft Excel. Also I have protected the formulas and titles, so you can't change it on accident.

[Click here for to open the template.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ndAyqLq0rD6iE7LMKdpKiyNUFQ2wDDEs9A7C8nn5H4/edit?usp=sharing)

On sheet 'Investment 1', you can individually add your orders. (I recommend this sheet, as this one is way easier)

* Under 'Purchase', you should fill in the price/share, amount of shares, fee, exchange amount (Enter  
1 if the stock is in Dollar) and purchase date (the last 2 are needed for formulas).
* When you sold that stock, enter the sale in the 'Sale' section after the purchase of that stock. The  
spreadsheet will calculate the gains/losses you've made.
* When running out of lines you can add lines by rightclicking the second last visable row and select  
'insert 1 below', then press ctrl+D (when the added row is still selected) to copy the formulas from  
the cell above.
* In row 27 there is a sum of; the total you have currently invested, the total you have purchased and  
sold, and the total you have gained/lost.

&#x200B;

On sheet 'Investment 2', it is the same principle as the previous sheet, but here you can group the stocks.

* This sheet will also calculate how much you currently have invested in each stock.
* It's a little trickier to add rows in this sheet. You will have to be carefull not to add a row after the bottom row of a stock (for example row 11), otherwise the formula that calculates the total of that stock will not calculate those rows. Instead add rows at the first row of a stock, or the second last. You can always hide the last row of a stock to prevent that from happening, as I have done with Tesla and To the moon.
* When you want to add a new stock you can add a few rows at the second last row(Row 12, Row 13 is hidden so the formula doenst get fucked) equal to the amount of rows a stock group has, so you can copy those rows into the new rows. For example Tesla has 3 rows (row 3 to 5,row 4 is hidden), so add 3 new rows behind a stock group, then copy those Tesla rows and paste them into the new rows. Now you have the formulas so you can delete the data in the new rows.

&#x200B;

On sheet 'Strategy', you can keep track of how much you want to invest in stocks, options, etc.

1. Add the total budget you have into cell C1
2. Decide what percentage you want to invest in each section (Cell B2, E2, H2) and give it a name in the cell to the left
3. Decide what percentage you want to invest in each row of a section (Example: Cell B3, B4) and give it a name in the cell to the left.
4. The sheet will calculate what the budget is for each stock or whatever.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Hope I didn't miss anything. Also hope you guys find this usefull, if not, then buy GME stocks right the f\*ck now. F\*ck Melvin, all my homies hate Melvin. 💎✋

GME Time&Sales analysis on 1/20/2021 between 949am-10am,0.87,"Hear me out GME gang,

I took Time&Sales data from my broker - details of each and every GME trade that happened on 01/20 between 9:49 and 10am, right when price swinged wildly from dip at $43 to $45 and down to $40.

I wanted to analyze how swings like these happen and why and below is link to my Tableau Public dashboard:

[https://public.tableau.com/views/GME\_Analysis\_2020\_01\_20/TimelineAnalysis?:language=en&:display\_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz\_share\_link](https://public.tableau.com/views/GME_Analysis_2020_01_20/TimelineAnalysis?:language=en&:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link)

am I onto something?

&#x200B;

The parameter on the right lets you choose what to look at: Bid Exchange (Which exchange the buy order originated from?) and Ask Exchange (Where the matching sell order originated from?)

&#x200B;

The big picture is that majority of buying volume is coming from:

1. EDGX - 25%

2. NYSE - 22%

3. Third Market Maker (what is this?) - 21%

4. P (NYSE ARCA Options) - 13%

5. IX (IEX?) - 11%

Majority of selling volume was coming from:

1. Third Maker Maker - 23%

2. NYSE - 22%

3. P (NYSE ARCA Options) - 19%

4. DE X (EDGX) - 16%

5. Z (BATS Options) - 9%

&#x200B;

What I am thinking here, is that this volatility like that when prices swing wildly is driven by algorithms/options market makers (HFT) that do delta hedghing and then unwind their positions as they pass options inventory to somebody else.

GME: A look at price vs volume.,0.97,"tl;dr: Relative to volume, GME is steadily growing. It's not mooning as hard as you think, and it's not as volatile as you think. If you expect high volume days coming up, then expect 🚀.

This is just a different perspective and might be completely retarded. So use your own best judgement. As always, happy to hear opposing viewpoints in comments, assuming my post doesn't get deleted.

------

Every chart you look at probably has the X axis as time. What happens if you make the x-axis volume, instead?  What would this even mean?

Assume that each time a stock is traded, it's the market moving forward towards what it thinks the fair value of the stock is. If you agree with this assumption, then days of high volume see the market move towards fair value more, and days of low volume see it move forward less.

Put another way: days of high trading volume are ""fast-forwarding"" through ""fair-value time"". Days of low volume are ""slow-motioning"" through ""fair-value time"".

Fortunately, there's a way to view price relative to volume.

**[Here's a regular chart of GME, with time as the x-axis.](https://imgur.com/IYoHHEQ)** Keep in mind Set 2020 is when Cohen got on board.

It looks fucking crazy volatile, and it looks like GME is blasting off to space. Citron will tell you this is ""too much, too soon"". Your instinct might tell you the same.

**[Here's the same chart, but with volume as the x-axis.](https://imgur.com/JJBwveA)**

There are many things to note:

* There's as much volume in the last 4 months as there was in the 11 months before that.
* A very steady growth rate since Sep (thanks, Ryan)
* Drops are generally on days of low volume
* The volatility in the last 4 months doesn't seem as crazy

From this perspective, GME isn't mooning.  It's not *that* volatile. It's just that the market has picked up its pace of valuing it. We're moving through ""fair-value time"" faster.

If you buy these assumptions, and if you also have a bullish thesis about GME's fundamentals, then you shouldn't feel nervous about the high-volume days coming up.  **You should be happy that the market is going to be reaching a consensus about fair market value much quicker.**

Personally, I think the market is starting to value GME as a growth stock. I don't mind if it does this faster.

Citron's Plan: Short and Distort (A 🌈🐻 Market Manipulation Strategy),0.97,"A late-night WSB discussion and story of hyperbole and conjecture.

So, we've all seen Citron's/Shitron's tweet about how they have big news or **5 rEaSoNs WhY** you should sell GME tomorrow. I think now is the time to look closely at what they're attempting to do. I'm beginning to better understand the position of the firms like Melvin are in: totally underwater and fucking drowning.

Even still as GME's stock rises, these Melvins are *continuing* to take short positions\[1\]. Now, I am just a humble retard with a ~~cultural anthropology associates~~ worthless degree, but I can read at a 6th grade level, and I think I finally figured out what that means, ""taking shorts."" I'm even going to type it out loud for you all so my dumb smooth brain can hear it. (And please correct me if I am wrong.)

They (the rainbow bear firms) are borrowing stock from a broker, selling that stock *immediately* at market price, and then giving the broker a note scribbled on the back of a soggy cocktail napkin that says ""I O U one (1) share <3"". So that means if some fucking boomer firm tomorrow buys 100,000 shares on short, they're *borrowing* 100,000 shares from a broker, selling those *borrowed shares* for cash (e.g. 100,000 shares \* $GME at close = $3,936,0000) and then just hoping and praying that every GameStop on Earth gets hit by an asteroid, the share price falls to $0, and they don't have to pay back one cent of their gigantic loans.

Holy shit. Taking out a loan and then hoping you don't have to pay back the loan isn't investing—it's fucking retarded.

Melvins are getting seriously desperate and will try to distort the reality of GMEs situation, so whatever news you read about GME tomorrow from the mouths of these hedge fund firms (Cramer, Shitron, Melvin, whatever else bullshit these boomer dinosaurs throw at us) should be taken with a HUGE grain of salt. The only strategy they have is to borrow more shares and sell them to drive the stock price down. They put their feet in giant cement shoes on the gamble that GameStop is going bankrupt because HURR DURR MALL STORES. Well, now is time for the ""retail investors"" to show them how fucking wrong they are and make them pay for it. Can't stop, won't stop, *et cetera.*

Squeeze did not happen today because of a couple of reasons:

1. There were outstanding shares for Citron/Melvin/short sellers to continue to short to push the price down. At this point, we can see that there are barely any shares left for them to short.
2. Paper-handed autists who panicked-sold when they bought in at 43-34 and saw it drop to 38 without understanding it was going to happen due to the shorts.

They [timed their tweet and simultaneously shorted close to 2.2m shares](https://i.imgur.com/MMb3i5n.png) but people were relentless in buying them all up. As we can see, the trackers eventually stopped tracking the shares available to short, as it went from a million down to [8,000 to 7,000 bouncing back up to 100,000](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/773545837212598284/801303927215226901/dq6ajcxm7bc61.png) before it went radio silent.

​

Yet even with their efforts, people still bought and they barely tanked the stock price at all. It even tested the 42 price limit once again just prior to power hour.


**How did those 100,000 shares get freed up?**

Yes, you got it, paper-hands who are selling their shares & refilling the shorts' ammo.

Also brokers who borrow shares from people's account on opting to pay them interest for the melvins & citrons to short (please explicitly call your broker to say you do not want them lending shares out)

They are done, unless there is a mass exodus of people who sell their shares(we can clearly see that's not the case, any dip is immediately bought up and we go right back to challenging any price limits of 41, 42, 44) ; the interest rates for them to borrow shares to continue to short their positions will eventually kill them. We are already at 57% interest over the weekend, we are so very close.

​

For the squeeze to occur, many people must understand what is actually going on.

​

If you do not, then seeing it fall from 43 to 38 in a couple of hours will definitely scare you. But there's a reason why we call it diamond-handing, because none of these actually matters. There will still be dips, there will be always people paper-handing their shares but once it squeezes, it will be glorious. There are people who got in over a year ago and have made millions who will not let go, because they fully grasp the situation.

​

Don't let your heart rule over the sensible minds who know this inside out for a year or 2 in this one, because if you are afraid the squeeze is not coming and decide to sell your shares, just know that the same way it gets continuously bought up at 38,39 there will be people who still go in.

## **tl;dr:**

## **1. BUY SHARES WITH CASH. TURN OFF SHARE BORROWING.**
## **2. STOP PAPER HANDING GME!! DIAMOND HAND ALL THE WAY. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**
## **3. BUY SHARES WITH CASH. TURN OFF SHARE BORROWING.**

**Disclaimer**

This is not investment advice and only serves to provides commentary on of the financial markets and a mosaic theory on what is happening and what will come with respect to GME.

**Pre-amble**

For those that did not read my earlier post a link is below – it provides most of underlying commentary on what has been going on with GME with this post filling in some additional details. It’s unfortunately a long read and for most of you that attended the The Derek Zoolander Center for Kids Who Can't Read Good and Who Wanna Learn to Do Other Stuff Good Too, I wish you the best of luck (assuming you failed out).

[Legacy of WSB: GME Short Squeeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzftk2/legacy_of_wsb_gme_short_squeeze/)

Unfortunately for Jim Cramer (“Jimbo”), I didn’t bring him up in previous post because I admire him or watch his show. It’s because the man himself is going to help describe what happened today with GME. Cue up the video or a read the transcript below. I honestly find Jimbo annoying as fuck and I don’t want to force and of you actually listen or look at him.

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMShFx5rThI)

[Transcript](https://slate.com/culture/2007/03/will-cramer-s-crazy-confession-destroy-his-career.html)

Before I actually get into some of Jimbo’s self admitted tricks of the trade and how they are being applied to GME, I need tell you a quick story about a lovely little real estate holding company called Global Links (traded over the counter) and an investor by the name of Robert Simpson. Simpson’s win was so big, he was interviewed on Bloomberg News on 14Mar2007 along with the CEO of Overstock.com (remember that company from my last post that hit 669 days on the Threshold Security List?). Well Simpson’s big trade was spending $5,000 to acquire 100% of the company (he actually acquired 111% or 1,282,050 shares), the really cool part of this trade was that despite owning over 100% of the company the trading volume over the next 2 days was 50 million shares.

[Transcript: Phantom Shares,' Failed Trades and Naked Shorts](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-145.htm)

The only other quick primer you folks need to digest the below is a quick understanding of market manipulation. As per the ever so useless folks at the SEC (directly from their website), market manipulation is when someone artificially affects the supply or demand for a security (for example, causing stock prices to rise or to fall dramatically).

Market manipulation may involve techniques including:

· Spreading false or misleading information about a company;

· Engaging in a series of transactions to make a security appear more actively traded; and

· Rigging quotes, prices, or trades to make it look like there is more or less demand for a security than is the case.

**Market Manipulation**

Again, a big thanks to the Eight Pound, Six Ounce, Newborn Baby Jimbo, don't even know a word yet (reference to Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby because it pains me to think of that bald 65-year asshole). Let’s review the Institutional short’s toolkit and then figure out what is going on with our beloved Gamestop.

**1. Flooding the offer side of the board**: Any of you folks with level 2 data seen those fun price walls?

**2. Short Down Ladder**: Short A will open a new short position and sell a share at $40 and short B will buy that share to cover an existing position and the open a new short at $39 and so on.

**3. Media Assault**: I am sure we have all seen the fun tweet from Citron today and all desperately tried to get out of our positions. Any of you read business articles are immediately scroll to bottom to see if there a disclaimer noting that the author was paid to write the article? Conveniently the first article that pops up when I search GME on google includes “*The author has received compensation for writing this article” (Link:* [https://www.fxstreet.com/news/gamestop-gme-stock-price-and-forecast-dont-get-gamed-202101191637](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/gamestop-gme-stock-price-and-forecast-dont-get-gamed-202101191637))

**4. Analyst Reports**: Undisclosed compensation and bias research is a professional no-no for many financial designations. Many of the current price targets seems unreasonably low, like below liquidation value kind of low – does any of this make sense ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/price-target/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/price-target/))

**5. Pulling Margin** – holy shit, didn’t this just happen - Short’s are starting to get desperate aren’t they?

**6. Paid Bashers** – Paying people to spam messages boards to create panic and insight selling. This goes way back to 2007 but trust me when I say this will only get worse ([https://www.wired.com/2007/12/confessions-of-2/](https://www.wired.com/2007/12/confessions-of-2/)

**Trading Day in Review**

What everyone needs to consider is that despite the shorts sparing no expense, the share price is still going up and the shorts are getting deeper and deeper under water every day and will only become more and more desperate. Their backs are against the wall and they need to fight to the death to survive. Closing out positions would result in long drawn-out Tesla Style squeeze and would still likely result in the bankruptcy of these funds. Their only chance pushing GME into bankruptcy (very unlikely with Cohen and Co taking over the board).

What some of you are starting to clue into and discuss openly is the visibility of market manipulation. I don’t really care what Citron will say tomorrow but if there is a Q&A someone really should ask how the short’s can postpone the close off requirements on Threshold Securities near indefinitely or when they try and ‘describe’ short interest maybe ask their thoughts about the legality of front running trades.

One of the sparsest sections of my original post was on the short interest. I don’t have access to the Ortex data and I will rely on others posts for this data. Remember Robert Simpson from the pre-amble who acquired 100% of the shares in Global Links and yet had his shares traded 50-times over the next 2-days? SEC enforcement has historically been extremely weak and the actual short interest could be much higher then what is reported.

Normal market price discover is simple economics – the price is established based on where supply and demand meet. More buying pressure the price goes up and more selling pressure the price goes down. All things being equal, how many people increased their positions on the dips today? How many sold? How many were forced to sell some of your position after your margin was pulled?

The market price action is that the currently described by the below (historical volume, daily high, and daily low can be viewed at: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history/))

a) **The current float is small and shrinking**. Retail is going long and we want to keep buying and I want to retire in the coming weeks. Please sir may I have some more?

b) **Volume is unreasonably high** – every share in the company has turned over 5x in the last 4-trading sessions. If you did deeper into timing short attacks, you will learn that doing it upon earnings, press releases, or news announcements helps to mask the associated volume increase. If you refer to my original post, you will know that shorting a stock creates a synthetic share - if they Shorts try a hastily exit, the price will quickly start jumping up.

c) **Volatility is increasing**. If you look at the daily history, what do you notice about the range between the high and low? Citron announced a webinar tomorrow on how to remove the shit stains from their dress pants (Hint: it involves depressing the GME stock price so they can stop defecating in risk management meetings). Volatility will only continue to get worse and its all due to the actual float Shrinking. The Cake is a Lie (Portal reference).

If retail investors maintain demand and don't get disheartened, volume will continue to contract and the shorts are going to dig themselves into a deeper and deep hole until they are no longer solvent. This is exciting, I am “Jacked to the Tits” as we are going to witness the biggest redistribution of wealth in our lifetimes.

Thanks again for the your assistance explaining what is wrong with the markets Jimbo. I am still hoping there is a journalist with some integrity that might push out the real story on the GME play.

Minimum price target of $1,000+ stands because fuck you Jimbo, you friends dug themselves into a hole that they cant mathematically get out of without material market manipulation. Fuck you, Pay Me.",2021-01-20 04:42:37
Based on my math Shitron dies when GME surpasses 42,1.0,,2021-01-20 04:37:16
How I Feel About $GME/$BB🚀💎🌙🚀💎🚀,1.0,,2021-01-20 04:23:22
BB Gamma Conditions,0.92,"**TLDR: Blackberry shot up massively today on a gamma squeeze, with market makers/dealers having to buy shit tons of shares (maybe 70 or 80m) to hedge all the options they sold you guys. That ramp is now used and is a bit of a liability, but not if you have diamond hands as a group. Movement up from here will require the stock attracts more money, but you get an EZ mode boost again from $14.5-$16.25 or so. Stock becomes less risky if you can reach $13. It's volatile at $12.6**

As you all know, there was a GME gamma squeeze last week (you guys say short squeeze, but I believe dealers bought 30m or more shares tues/wed/thursday to hedge all the options they sold you guys). Historic in scale I think, one of the largest ever to hit a small cap stock.  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Completely not to my surprise, BB has exactly the same thing going on, with insane open interest, and you guys appear to have done it again today with BB, so that's two historic gamma squeezes over two weeks. I wonder which stock is next?  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I went and examined BB, in which I have absolutely no position and haven't the faintest clue what is up with it other than it's some sort of fruit 🍇 and space exploration company🚀 that also makes star trek style tricorders [📲](https://emojipedia.org/mobile-phone-with-rightwards-arrow-at-left/), which all sounds pretty cool actually, so I should probably be long.

BB has a float or 508m shares. Here's the current gamma chart of the stock:

[https://imgur.com/a/jyySqX9](https://imgur.com/a/jyySqX9)

For those of you who haven't been paying attention, or are unable to form new memories for medical or genetic reasons, gamma squeeze is when the price moves quickly over various option strikes, causing dealers to buy a ton of stock (if price up) or sell a ton of stock (if price down) so as to not be underwater on the options they sold you guys. In other words, a stock with a TON of options bought by WSB will tend to move a lot faster in price around those option strikes.

Looking at this gamma chart, and those are in hundred thousand contracts btw, you can see why today went crazy. Today, BB, in going from $10.15 a share or wahtever to 12.51 a share, forced dealers to buy about 70 or 80m shares.... on a 508m float... which means they were 2/3 of the trading today. Not really surprising to buy 20% of the float on dealer action (plus whatever you guys were buying) and see a 25% move up. I'm a little surprised it wasn't more tbh, so there are probably some covered calls held by dealers in there, and those people are hating life right now.

The problem is though that you guys hit the end of the gamma ramp. That's why the stock slowed down after 12.5 - you can see it in the gamma chart. No gamma lift means no more forced dealer buying. The good news is there is another gamma ramp at 15, so if you get it up to like 14.5, it'll ramp real easily to maybe 16 16.25 I think, but after that, no ramp.

In terms of short-term trading dynamics, there are some options expiring this week - about 35 thousand contracts of calls. These will cause a VERY slight melt-up (maybe half a percent tops) as the week goes on, then when dumped or monetized Friday, will cause selling of 3.5m shares of selling, which isn't really a huge deal, and should have marginal effects on price, like half a percent at most down. Most of this open interest is much longer dated, mostly out a year or more.

Why does all of this matter? well:

1. It's going to be harder for the price to go up from here without new gamma established, or a lot more buying. Dealers did heavy lifting for you today with that 70 or 80 million share purchase (would have been more if shorted dated, but it wasn't). That's not happening again until 15, and at 15, it's still only maybe 25m shares in reality, not 70 or 80m, so you'd expect a smaller acceleration there.
2. If people monetize their calls, it's going to hurt, as dealers dump to de-hedge, and there's a gamma ramp down as you can see.
3. And of course, the stock is vulnerable to a push down since you have a massive gamma ramp below the price, and no gamma ramp above.
4. But, those calls are super long duration, so I would not be freaking out. I just think there's resistance up from here, which was seen in today's price action - no gamma ramp.

I have no idea where it goes from here. I have no idea if BB is undervalued. And I always disclose my positions, and have no position in BB. But, it's not at a stable price right here - resistance up until 14.5 or so, and a fast, greased up slide down if selling happens. If you can get to 14.5 though, it's an express train to 16.25 or so.

Consequently, if anyone wants gamma write-ups on other stocks that are trending around here, let me know.

A More Neutral View on Citron,0.62,"To further look into the history of Citron Research, I read the Wikipedia page on Andrew Left. Now I know how Wikipedia as a source can be biased and inaccurate, but there are several pieces of information here worth looking into.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew\_Left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left)

Contrary to everyone here saying that Citron has been wrong on every stock he shorted, WSJ says 

>111 Citron short-sale reports spanning from 2001 to 2014, there was an average share-price decline of 42 percent in the year after Left's report was released. Of those shares, 90 were lower one year later while 21 gained, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. 

Source [link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-short-who-sank-valeant-stock-1445557157)

Now this may be old data from 2001-2014 and his predictions may have become progressively worse ever since. I just want to look at the possible selection bias of PLTR, BB, TSLA, NVDA and every other one of his failed shorts.

However, here's where I think the juicy part is. Consider Andrew Left's checkered past:

> Left's first job was with Universal Commodity Corp, a high-pressure [commodities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_market) brokerage firm that hired salespeople to make [cold calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_calling) and push ""questionable investments.""[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left#cite_note-reut-12) Left quit in March 1994, after 9 months with the company. When the [National Futures Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Futures_Association)  sanctioned the firm in December 1998, Left, along with every other  former employee, was sanctioned for three years along with being  required to take an ethics-training course 

&#x200B;

> Left became active in [short selling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance))  by the age of 24. He has cited his experience with Universal Commodity  Corp as the reason he started short selling stocks promoted by  boiler-room scams. 

He has a lot of experience with securities fraud and uses that knowledge to short stocks with illicit activity. This is where he may have made successful predictions. Yet this is not without controversy. Many firms have sued Citron for defamation and deliberately crashing their stock prices:

> Qihoo 360 has threatened to take legal action against Citron Research, as has former [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) China chief Kai-Fu Lee, now the chairman and CEO of Innovation Works.[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left#cite_note-wantchinatimes1-41)[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left#cite_note-42)  In 2012, posted a detailed, point-by-point rebuttal, via Sinocism, to  Chinese investment platform Xueqiu.com, which also suggests that Citron  had taken advantage of reader unfamiliariarity with Chinese languages  and markets. Lee stated that, ""Since Citron has already made big bets on  these recommendations before their reports are published... Citron’s  recommendation doesn’t have to be right; Citron just needs to mislead  their readers to follow their recommendations!” 

Sounds eerily familiar to what's happened to GME today? I don't think it's a cooincidence. As far as I'm concerned, there is no fraud or illicit activity happened with GME, or the other meme stocks that he tried to short. He simply made the wrong bets, took positions in fields outside his expertise (fraud), and lost a lot of money. Now he is using his experience with fraud against us, deliberately pushing GME down so he doesn't get squeezed.

Point is, maybe sometimes Citron is right to short a stock when the company is engaged in fraud. But every wsb stock he tried to short was based on his conviction that it was overvalued, and he was totally wrong.

Going into tomorrow, I hope everyone exercises some caution. He seems to know what he is doing with market manipulation. Maybe trim positions a little at the top, and buy the dip once his dump ass twitter stream starts at 11:30. I'm bullish as anyone else on this sub, just thought this background info might prove useful as I don't see anyone else bringing it up.

TL;DR Be careful, shitron seems to have a lot of experience with fraud and market manipulation. Obviously don't paper hand, but tomorrow might be a good opportunity to manage position and buy the dip on GME.

oh and for good measure heres some rocket emojis 🚀🚀🚀🚀

EDIT: what I meant by ""exercise caution"" is expect volatility tomorrow, gme is likely to drop around 11:30 when shitron livestreams. At that point, selling will only help the shorts. Hold positions or buy the dip to average down would be the smart move",2021-01-20 04:19:21

# DJ GameStop Stock Is Soaring. It Could End Badly. -- Barrons.com

https://preview.redd.it/t5f3zdu6lec61.jpg?width=1151&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b68789578ac91a585a227c02e5b0fe37c9ad17f

 ·  2021/01/19 12:46 GMT-06:00By Connor Smith

GameStop stock continues to soar amid interest from retail investors one analyst called ""rabid."" Now the stock now has the attention of a notable activist short seller.

Citron Research's Andrew Left wrote in a Tuesday post on Twitter that he plans to host a livestream discussing five reasons those buying GameStop (ticker: GME) stock at recent levels ""are the suckers at this poker game.""

""Stock back to $20 fast,"" he wrote. ""We understand short interest better than you and will explain.""

Left did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Barron's asking him to expand on his thoughts, as well clarify whether he's taken a short position himself. But around the time of Left's post, GameStop stock pared back from a $45.52 intraday high. The stock closed up 11% to $39.36.

On Tuesday, 74.6 million GameStop shares were traded, the stock's fifth-highest volume on record, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Last Wednesday set a record volume for the stock, when 144.5 million shares were traded.

GameStop shares doubled last week following news that three former Chewy executives, including co-founder Ryan Cohen, were joining the company's board. Cohen's RC Ventures has a 13% stake in GameStop, and has urged the company to close more stores and embrace e-commerce.

The day of the announcement, the company pulled out of a planned appearance by executives at last week's ICR investment conference. A GameStop spokesman had pointed Barron's to the conference for commentary on the company's long-term plans. GameStop representatives haven't returned repeated requests seeking comment in the week since.

After the pop last week, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter pointed to the stock's massive short interest, recently at 138% of shares available for trading, according to FactSet data compiled by Dow Jones Market Data. Short-selling analytics firm S3 Partners, which adjusts its short-interest calculations, estimated short interest of about 58% earlier this month.

Such bearish bets have left the stock primed for a short-squeeze, a short-term event where short sellers bid up shares, rushing to cover their positions. Pachter said such short sellers were ""squeezed by rabid retail investors."" He didn't think the pop would last, and has a $16 price target on the stock.

Left's post signaled he'll discuss the technical factors related to short selling at play during his stream, set for 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday. In recent weeks, Barron's has outlined a long-term bearish case. The company is struggling amid broader shifts to free-to-play games and digital downloads, both of which cut out physical game sales.

Despite new consoles from Sony (SNE) and Microsoft (MSFT) that were forecast to drive stronger sales in the broader games industry, GameStop said last week its sales were down 3.1% from last year during the nine-week holiday period. The company pointed to store closures, limited console supply, and the impact of Covid-19. But comparable sales, which strip out the effect of store closures, were only up 4.8% from a rough 2019 holiday period.

Many of the most popular games, like League of Legends and Fortnite, are free to download and play. Instead, publishers offer in-game cosmetic items directly in their online store. For those games, GameStop is often limited to acting as a middleman, selling gift cards for in-game points.

And as more players opt to download games directly on their consoles, it's the gatekeepers of such systems -- Sony, Nintendo (NTDOY), and Microsoft -- that stand to benefit. Meanwhile, PC game distribution is a crowded space. Valve's popular Steam online store is facing some competition from platforms offered by Fortnite maker Epic Games, CD Projekt (CDR.Poland), and Electronic Arts (EA). It's unclear how an old-school retailer like GameStop can make sustainable headway in this already competitive landscape.

Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are also leveraging their cloud infrastructure to offer cloud gaming-streaming services akin to Netflix. Adoption hasn't yet been disruptive to the broader industry. Microsoft, another major cloud player, and Sony have such services that are backed by their libraries of in-house content. GameStop has a profit-sharing deal with Microsoft for its Xbox Game Pass, but Credit Suisse analyst Seth Sigman noted at the time that he was skeptical that such a deal would offset the decline of physical game sales.

Add it all up, and it's clear GameStop will need to execute a radical turnaround plan to stay relevant.

[**SEC Keypoints when it comes to Short Selling**](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm)**:**

## D. Are short sales legal?

Although the vast majority of short sales are legal, abusive short sale practices are illegal. For example, it is prohibited for any person to engage in a series of transactions in order to create actual or apparent active trading in a security or to depress the price of a security for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of the security by others. Thus, short sales effected to manipulate the price of a stock are prohibited.

**TL;DR: Illegal if aimed at depressing price to induce sale of security by others**

**IMPORTANT:** *This is merely a curious correlation I'm trying to understand, not evidence that this is what went down.*

But how about you ask them about this during their livestream tomorrow or upgrade those tips you are sending to the SEC a bit, they might have better means to judge, I'm just a retard.

(Also, how could this happen with the Uptick Rule in place? Am I seeing patterns where there are none? If it was algos acting on tweet, do they usually have this level of effect?)

GME Market Manipulation and Stop Hunting,0.97,"Some behind the scenes on GME today. Let me know what you guys think. 

What happened today was institutional traders were creating a massive sell pressure, driving the price down to a low of 36.64. 

I saw a massive buy order at 36.50. I saw this with Level II data.

Why is this important? 
36.50 is where they will buy and go long (at least for today). They know at this level, most retailers have cut their wrist with paper hands and closed out of positions or forced to get closed out because of stop losses. They saw around this price that there was a majority of stop losses.

A Venture Capital Perspective on GME,0.98,"Hi everyone.  Long time WSB lurker and I've learned a lot here, so I'd like to give back and hopefully add some value to this sub.  I think it’s worth spending a little time laying out my thoughts on why I’m investing in GME as an active early stage VC, and hopefully my insights can help people not paperhand before the real gains are made.  I'll try to provide new insights that I haven't seen on this subreddit yet.

Full disclaimer- this is my personal money I’m investing.  Positions are 678 shares at a $39.81 average as a starter and looking to open a more significant position in the next few months once a few questions have been answered for me on things I’m looking to see (which I’ll discuss below).

Obligatory rockets: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.  If a few things happen, this goes to the moon regardless of a short squeeze.  I'll explain why below.

First, a quick overview at how most VC's do due diligence.

**How VC's Invest**

When we do due diligence on early stage investments (our Fund is a pre-seed and seed Fund with a few Series A deals), there’s a few things we look for, especially when evaluating growth companies in tech are as follows:

1) What’s the market size? There are three types of market sizes investors look at; TAM, SAM and SOM.   Feel free to look up how sizing these markets works if you aren't familiar, this is a long post so I won't waste people's time.  The important thing to remember here is that **the larger the TAM, the more room for growth and competition and the more interest there is to invest in a space.**  This is very important for GME and we will come back to why later.

2) What's the CAGR?  (Compound Annual Growth Rate).  Basically, is the market expanding or shrinking, and how fast.  Again, google this if not familiar.

3) Experience of the management team- have they actually been there before and demonstrated an ability to scale and exit a company in this space?

4) Unit economics- do the numbers make sense as this company grows?  Is it actually going to be profitable?  Every firm looks at these different.  We look at CAC/LTV ratios and doubling time with tech companies.  The TLDR of this is ""how much money does it cost me to get a new customer, how long will they be my customer before they leave, how much money will they spend while they are my customer, and how fast can I double the money I spent on advertising to get that new customer "".

There are a lot more things that obviously go into determining whether something is a good investment or not, but if there are red flags in any of these core areas a tech company is almost always uninvestable.

**Now onto why after recent developments I think GME is shaping up to be one of the most attractive investment opportunities that investors have seen in these markets in years, but why many of you will miss out on the majority of the gains long term.**

1 and 2) Market size and CAGR.  As a gamer myself in spare time and a tech investor this is a market that hasn't even scratched the surface of how large it will get.  Gaming is a market worth hundreds of billions, with an explosive CAGR as more young people grow up with gaming being a socially accepted activity and in many people's lives the center of their social experience.   Most of you are familiar with this already, so nothing more to be said here.  

Now the question in the past was, is Gamestop capable of growing their share of this market?  Until Ryan Cohen, the answer was no (and this is why the share price went down to where it was).  Again, you all know this.  But this leads to the second point of why it is now an attractive option

2) Ryan Cohen.  Not from an ""excited about a memeing CEO"" perspective, but from the most important thing to institutional investors- does he have a proven track record scaling and exiting profitable e-commerce businesses?  Yes he does.  

Again, you all know all this and it is how the stock price got to here today.  Everyone is sitting waiting and watching to see if there is a short squeeze (myself included), and there is a lot of hype and excitement.

**But this is leading everyone to miss the forest for the trees because of the 4th point:**

GME's Unit Economics have the potential to be best in industry, yet shares are priced at an extreme discount to revenues currently.

I'd encourage everyone to check out this article talking about how companies with strong growth are normally priced by tech investors by one of the A16z partner.  [https://a16z.com/2020/08/17/role-of-entry-multiples-in-valuations/](https://a16z.com/2020/08/17/role-of-entry-multiples-in-valuations/)  The article is titled ""why entry multiples don't matter"" and helps entrepreneurs understand how valuations of companies can make sense for tech investors.

The short of it is for all the WSBers who can't read: if you have more growth, you get a higher multiple because you will have the potential to produce far more dividends faster, especially in high margin tech companies.

So what is fascinating about GME?

**If I was presented a new company that had just driven it's e-commerce revenues 300%!!!!! YoY, operating in a several hundred billion TAM, backed by investors and management who had grown a company in the same vertical to hundreds of millions in annual subscription revenue, and with a strong balance sheet and distribution footprint and a widely recognized brand, 20x topline revenue in the early stages would be considered a steal to invest at.** 

Instead, GME is priced at a $2.8B market cap, less than half of annual revenues.

This is an unheard of valuation for a growth company to be trading at a discount.

So why is GME underpriced, and why did so many people (myself included) not see or continue to not see this opportunity until now?  If it's such a good opportunity, why are shares so cheap?

**Most investors are looking at the legacy Gamestop business that has existed for the past decade instead of treating GME like a new startup (CHEWY for Gaming).**

If Ryan Cohen can transform GME into a subscription-based membership model where in exchange for your monthly fee you have a one stop shop to all things gaming discounted, you have a company that could easily be valued at a 10-30x multiple on top-line revenues.  However, because most investors outside of this subreddit still view it as a traditional brick and mortar play vs. a subscription focused tech company with omnichannel growth strategies, they think a bubble is forming and are shorting it instead of buying in.

**So why am I not all in yet but why am I excited?**

The most important thing yet to be understood is what does the customer value proposition look like under the new direction Ryan Cohen takes GME.  Most large investors will be waiting to see how over the next year the balance sheet is strengthened for growth, what new revenue models can be implemented, and to see if there has been a true pivot from brick and mortar.

This is a company that if management can execute on correctly, most large institutional investors will be clamoring to get a significant stake in and grow it because the gaming market is here to stay and grow.  Bear arguments that digital game sales will hurt GME miss the entire point of the pivot.  Ryan understands this and wants to instead bring the whole gaming experience in house- everything you buy you want to buy from GME because you're part of their membership program (again think Costco).  Those programs are insanely profitable and if the unit economics show that to investors as the company pivots the valuation will soar immediately as people realize it's Amazon Prime, not Blockbuster.  However, it is yet to be seen if they can execute on this vision, which is why I am not all in yet.

There is still long term risk which is why this stock is still low.  Not a lot but there is some.

Maybe the company doesn't grow?  Maybe they reject Ryan's vision?

But here's the bottom line.

If a shift to digital first does occur, and GME becomes a subscription first omnichannel gaming company, the market cap will conservatively be 10x topline revenues.

Let's say that stays flat next year at $5B.  

This market cap (matching industry standards) **should for an appropriate valuation for a growth stock be $50B.** 

I know this sounds insane.  But if Ryan can complete the transformation he is hoping for this is a very conservative valuation.

A $50B market cap would be $800 a share right now.  Again, this assumes Zero topline revenue growth.  If revenue begins to grow again 10x will be unrealistic and the multiples will get far higher.

This is why the short squeeze is distracting many.  **In 5 years if you diamond hands this company, the fair value of shares can range from $800-$2400 and not be in any sort of bubble or unjustified by fundamentals speculation.**

TLDR; this company if Ryan does what we believe he will may be one of the most undervalued companies this subreddit has ever discovered.  Even if you take profits in a short squeeze, don't forget to keep shares for a long position because opportunities like this rarely come around.  I imagine the short squeeze will allow them to issue more shares to  strengthen the balance sheet, and the company has a fantastic launch pad to start from with the size of it's existing customer base, brand awareness, and revenue. If it becomes clear that GME will be executing on Ryan's vision even at a $10B market cap this will be a steal and I will open a full position then.  I am waiting to expand my position to see what happens with the pivot, as this all goes out the window if GME rejects his strategy.

As always, do your own DD but I have learned a lot about options from this sub and hopefully this helps a few people understand why selling shares may end up being the biggest regret of their life.  **GME's business model has the potential to look just like Amazon's with a focus on the gaming industry and these shares are only at this price because the market is still looking at the old company and not the new startup that GME could become.**

**Don't paper hand this one.**",2021-01-20 01:54:24
Efficient GME Play With LEAPS,0.92,"Hi fellow autists, I've been thinking about our favorite ticker and what else can we do to make it 🌕.

It might get fairly long so for the illiterates TLDR: GME 1/21/2022 25c 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I will venture and try to teach you new word today (LEAP) and a bit of foreign language (Greek) so you may sound sophisticated when you talk to your wife's boyfriend, explaining him where did your last Wendy's paycheck disappear.

Now that DFV broke taboos and showed us that holding shares, like a boomer, can make us shitload of money I wish to propose another thing that does not get mentioned enough here - LEAP, or in plain english long term option.

Now why is this smoothbrain now dropping this weird shit when we know that shares are play here you ask?

That's because I think leaps are more efficient way to play GME in the current situation. They behave like our favorite financial instrument (FDs aka options) and because they are valid for long time they behave like a stock. So we get best of both worlds.

Here's an example of what I'm talking about:

Jan 21 2022 25c can be bought for \~$21/share, which would be $2,100 for a contract. Which means that for $4,200 you can get 2 such contracts. For the same amount will get you \~100 shares (that's leverage options will give us). This option has Delta (that's your Greek lesson) of 0.774. Simplified; 1 such contract behaves like 77 shares. Two such contracts are equivalent to 154 shares so for the price of 100 shares we can buy 2 leaps that have value of 154 shares.  

What happens next you ask? Well for every option buyer there is a seller and guess who the seller is for new leaps you just bought? That's right our beloved MM's and what do they do? They cover their asses by keeping their positions delta neutral. And what did they do? They just sold you 2 GME leaps with delta of 0.77 making them 154 delta short. To make it delta neutral they have to BUY 154 GME shares. So your beautiful autistic purchase of 2 GME leaps results in them buying shares which is exactly what we want.

I don't say buy only leaps, but consider expanding your GME portfolio with some of them since they are more efficient (control more shares for the same money) than stocks and give us some leverage that brokers took away from us by eliminating margin on GME shares.

I'd like more experienced autists to weigh on this and tell me where are the flaws in my argument.

Melvin Capital is fucking retarded and their puts are expiring 1/22. Theta Gang can hop in now and help GME bulls while also pocketing some sweet Theta Tendies. IV is insane with most options at 200-300% or higher. Buying at just under $40 and selling $35c for 1/29 means as bulls ride the squeeze upward while Theta Gang has good downside protection.

Example:  Buy 100 GME at $38.75, Sell GME 35c 1/29 for \~$8 premium. You are in for $3075 and make money as long as GME finishes the month above $30.75, which it will. If your shares get called away at $35, you made $425 on $3075 invested, or \~13%. Good by Theta Gang standards for a week and a half of work.

You can find entry points and ITM strikes that work for you. I plan on loading up on 300-500 shares tomorrow doing this.

Just a recap of today’s GME rollercoaster🎢,0.98,"•To begin with, don’t listen to me, I’m not a financial advisor I’m just some fucking autist that wants to clear thing up in his head by summarizing what happened today with GME and though it would be a good idea to write it down.
To begin with, today was an extremely good day for us, with the market closing at 39.36, which is a 10.38% surge 🚀.
•The day started of with a huge uptrend, spiking at 45.40$, and this is when Citron 🍋 posted their tweet @9:58AM and the price plummeted to 36.88$ within 30 minutes. 
They clearly manipulated the market with their nonsense. 
The 1.2 million dollar put that was detected and alerted @10:19AM COULD be theirs. Perfect explains why their doing the retarded live stream tomorrow.
So maybe go sign the petition to get the SEC to investigate them. 
All throughout the day, main stream media & 🐻🌈 on Twitter continued to write stories about how GME is just a pump&dump and how we retail investors will fail miserably. 
We managed to 💎🤚🏼 while buying even more stocks during this war (!!!) and maintained a price level of 39.80$-42.10$ throughout the entire day.
The end of day drop was inevitable since some 📄🤚🏼 and of course day trades (many today) closed their positions. 

Now some good news today: 
•iBorrowDesk which reports live data from InteractiveBrokers, which is a huge broker, stopped reporting shares available to be borrowed for shorting @11:00AM. In their FAQ it says when they stop reporting, there are no more shares available to be borrowed. This gives us an idea of how small the number of shares available to borrow for shorting are in the entire market. If they can’t short and we hold the price high, shorts will be paying huge amounts of interest which will eventually lead them to cover their positions which will lead to the short squeeze. 
•Our GME Thread was on the front of Reddit, which means a lot of retards joined us today for sure.
•We showed Melvin and his 🌈🐻‘s that we are ONLY 💎🤚🏼 and buying more shares. I’m sure that after today’s multiple attempts to take us down he’s sweating balls.

From fractional shares to irresponsible six figure plays near the recent top, the GME hype is so overwhelming that even WSB has quarantined them into a specific thread. GME opened at a strong 15%+ and went as high as 25%+ intraday to $45.52 but a tweet by Andrew ""tool bag"" Left of Citron at 9:58 AM derailed the party and sent shares under $37 before the bull run continued. Shares of GME closed $39.36, up 10.87% as shorts continue to be squeezed, though the momentum has clearly be snapped a bit.

* Over at BB land, shares of BlackBerry Ltd. pumped another 25% as the market continues to shift the company's valuation as the Canadian company chugs on with their focus on enterprise security software/service. BB closed up 25.51% to $12.35. 

* NFLX reported stellar numbers as sub count tops 200 mil. New net sub numbered in 8.5 mil, an uptick of 2.2 mil from the previous quarter and beats previous projection of 6 mil by 2.5 mil. NFLX sees Q1 additions of 6 mil. While Q4 EPS was $1.19 vs $1.39, NFLX sees Q1 EPS of $2.97 vs consensus of $2.10, further propelling the stock. Implied move was about 8% for weeklies so for those who YOLO'ed you're gucci as long as you didn't buy some retardedly OTM strike. NFLX is up 12.5% as of writing in AH to $564. DIS is up 2% AH and ROKU is up about 1.6%.

* GM pumped more than 9% today on news of MSFT 2 bil investment in GM's self-driving startup Cruise, valuing the side hustle at 30 bil. The boomer stock has low-key been killing it in the past few years and as Model 3 replaces the entry-level 3 series and C class in various neighborhoods, you'll likely see GM EVs replacing various Hondas and Toyotas in the coming years as well. GM closed up 9.75% to $54.84.

* Bank/financial earnings continues with BAC and GS reporting this morning. Both reported strong quarters tho the run-up may have been a bit too much as both underlyings faced the same sell-off pressure their sector faced last Thursday. BAC authorized a 2.9 bil repurchase plan, shares closed the day down slightly -0.73% to $32.77 while GS closed -2.26% to $294.

* Incoming Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urges Biden to act big to further help the rona punished economy, but also made some notes on raising corporate rates eventually (once the US overcomes rona). With Yellen set to replace Mnunchin, those who enjoyed Mnunchin's various stimulus phone tag with Pelosi will no doubt miss the ""stimulus talks are going well"" pumps.

* Shares of home builders reacted favorably to Biden's $15,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit proposal, though it will likely face an uphill battle in Congress given the various scope and size of the overall stimulus package. LEN is up 2%, DHI up 2.8%, PHM up 3%, NVR up 3.74%, and KBH up 5.5%.

* In WSB meme stock land not named GME and BB, ICLN closed up 2.75% as the cleantech pump resumes, while MT took a beating of -4% to closed at $22.96, despite a slight PT raise of .5 Euro by Morgan Stanley. Surely metal gang won't be another tanker gang situation.

* In recent IPO land, DASH is up 6.20% to $198 (yeah this 60 bil market cap makes tote sense), AFRM is down -5.14% to $110, AI pulled back -5.46% to $126, and ABNB closed up 2.61% to $173.

* The DOW closed up 0.38% or 116 pts, Nasdaq up a strong 1.53% or 198 pts, SPX up 0.81% or 30 pts, and RUT is up 1.32% or almost 28 pts.

* Notable ERs and numbers later this week: UAL, DFS after market close on Wednesday and INTC on Thursday after market close. Housing market index on Wednesday morning at 10 AM ET, jobless claims at 8:30 AM on Thursday, and on Friday PMI at 9:45 AM ET with existing home sales soon to follow at 10 AM ET.

Logical bullish case for $GME to go to the moon DD,0.92,"Gamestop has the vast majority of the video game space.  


I have an SEO background and pulled up some of these statistics

&#x200B;

For all general related keywords for video games  


Gamestop gets 9,200,000 vistors, with 2.7m organic keywords

Bestbuy gets 25,100 vistors, with 8000 organic keywords  


Amazon gets 18,100 vistors, with 2600 organic keywords

Walmart gets 12,000 vistors, 9200 keywords  


They are been touted as going BK just because they are wasting money on employees and brick & mortar spaces.  


but they crush it, absolutely crush the eCom space  


  
The video game space is supposed to be north of $200B by 2022.  
Let's say only half of that is from online sales, which more and more is moving online now. So $100b.  


If gamestop closed all their stores that are losing money, kept the ones doing well or leave some stores for trade-ins and just went all in on eCom (assuming that is why Sir Ryan Cohen is on board)  


Gamestop being roughly half of the video game space, a $100b eCom space would make them a $50b company.  


Right now there marketcap is $2.5B!  


  
TL:DR, Gamestop dominates the ecommerce space for videogames. Ryan Cohen could just go full board eCom and make this into an actual successful business. $GME to the moon",2021-01-19 22:13:19

Kids shopping at GME in Europe,0.95,"What's up tards

I'm writing this from Paris while smoking cigarettes, drinking wine and eating bread. Fuck you.

And fuck the virus too. But most importantly fuck Melvin: last week-end I was out in the city (Paris remember?) and keep in mind because of the fucking virus it's the ONLY FUCKING DAY we are allowed to go out - more or less, some people will discuss this but they don't matter.

Anyway, in the metro (in Paris remember?) I saw a group of teenage kids that were excited as bunch of zits can be, and where do you think they were coming from? Micromania, French brand 100% owned by GME.

My point is this: it's the weekend during a pandemic and these kids SHOP FOR GAMES AT B&M STORES. With their friends, because that's what you do when you are 15 and you don't have a fucking credit card but you saved up on pennies selling croissants all year long - jk, these kids don't need to work.

Games are fun, games are social. You buy games with your friends, it's a ritual. Brand loyalty is real. Shelling out 60 bucks for a game when you are a teenager is like YOLOing all your savings in a stock: it deserves celebration, so you go out with your friends and make it an event.

the SEC fucking sucks,0.96,"Almost all of us have been scammed recently. Whether it was today on GME, last month on PLTR, or any number of the countless times a shitstain market manipulator like shitron
research has put out a totally uneducated, intentionally misleading ""analysis"" in order to print puts. 

Its always the same pattern. They take their put position, send out the ""news"" and then dump a bunch of shares on the market to make it look like anyone actually gives a fuck what they think. these people are leeches on our economy, worthless pigs who do nothing but suck money from the veins of actual investors. 

but you know who is just as responsible? our brokers. thats right, if you ask me, our actual brokers are actually MORE responsible for the manipulation that happens here. they take a tweet that gets like what, 120 retweets in a whole day? and decide, this is newsworthy, better blast it out to every single one of our customers so whenever they pull up the 
stock, they can see what Andrew Dickbreath Left has to say on the matter. 

if the SEC was worth a single fucking tax dollar, there'd be something holding brokers culpable for the ""news"" they advertise to their customers. THIS is where the manipulation really happens. Yeah, it starts with scam artists like left who create a brand name and pretend to be some kind of financial analyst, but without our brokers those guys are just another retard roleplaying belfort in his basement. 

All of their power comes from the fact that our own brokers are the very vehicles of their manipulation, and they just get away with it, ""oh we're just providing the news, we didnt write that!""

Before I get into this, I need to say two things first. One, shorters will keep shorting, they're in too deep. Second, they will also do their absolute best to make ANYONE ELSE sell or short too, and they've had years of practice on how to manipulate people.

# Reason 1: GME is a mall-store blockbuster (no future), will cite earnings reports

Please see this [very extensive Due Diligence (DD)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/) along with this [fascinating new development](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/).

GME is on a trajectory to do some pretty cool things, even without the short squeeze that has everyone excited. Long buyers are in.

&#x200B;

Most likely things they will cite are:

1. Total sales declined 3.1% in the holiday sales report
2. Large 3rd quarter sales declines (pre-covid vs post-covid the most likely cause).
3. Closed 11% of stores (which they did to cut underperforming stores, and because their stores are FAR too dense, especially given an increased focus on E-commerce)

&#x200B;

Most likely things they will intentionally leave out:

1. Comparable store sales increased 4.8% in holiday report (so, decrease likely because of store closures)
2. E-commerce is at 34% of company sales, equivalent to Best Buy percentage (and growing rapidly, and more rapidly than Best Buy)
3. Regional sales in Australia/New Zealand (no covid) went UP 31%

&#x200B;

# Reason 2: Insiders are selling

This is true. But here are the facts that they will leave out:

1/12/21-1/13/21: Hestia Capital (whose managing member is Wolf Kurt James) sold 945,550 shares of GME for this reason ""in order to better align with the maximum concentration guidelines for single stock investment of Hestia Capital"". The fund still owns 91,000 shares and Wolf Kurt James PERSONALLY AND DIRECTLY still owns 50,689 (including 20,000 of his wife's shares).

Also,

1/13/21: Dunn Lizabeth sold 5,000 shares of GME. She still owns 57,258.

1/13/21-1/15/21: Raul J Fernandez sold 31,119 shares of GME. He still owns 29,289 *\[updated\]*

1-13-21: Kathy P Vrabeck sold 50,000 shares of GME. She still owns 79,537.

The forms regarding the previous 3 people's sales were all filed by Dunn Lizabeth, suggesting that they sold as a coordinated choice. Also, all three of those people are NOT on the Board of Directors as proposed by RC Ventures (and conditionally agreed to by Gamestop, an agreement they'll almost definitely keep given the huge increases in share price upon RC Ventures' buy-in and policy changes that RC Ventures has strongly suggested/recommended)

Source: [SEC Filings](https://sec.report/Ticker/GME)

&#x200B;

# Reason 3: This is a pump and dump sneaky nonsense by WSB

First, lol. The people on this sub don't have anything like that sort of buying power (especially not if we take out the people that actually believe in GameStop). More importantly, see reason #1 (especially the part about outstanding short interest).

&#x200B;

# Reason 4: The short squeeze has already happened

Now here, I expect them to throw up some really shady data analysis looking at shares shorted or available to short or short interest % of daily trading and try and pretend like that number really means that the shorts have already covered. Here's the important data (there's some in the DD in #1 as well).

First, [Short interest was higher than float as of EOD Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzwo2z/gme_short_interest_declined_to_71m_and_some_other/), meaning it would take DAYS of trading to cover. We'll see updated numbers for Tuesday soon. Short interest actually INCREASED during the Wed-Thurs time that Citron will likely try to say was the short squeeze. Now, these are Ortex estimates based on the self-reported shares short at a large aggregate of brokerages, but have been very reliable  when compared to the official SEC data that comes out every half a month.

The point being that it is extremely, extremely likely that shorts HAVE NOT covered, and have in fact DOUBLED DOWN ON SHORTING TO DRIVE DOWN THE PRICE. Meanwhile, it is further likely that long buyers have locked in MORE shares so the real % short/float is higher than we would expect on the assumption that every float share is really not locked down.

&#x200B;

# Reason 5: More shares traded than are short. Meaning days to cover is not close to accurate.

This is absolutely true. Days to cover is based on an average of the daily volume over the past few days. What they will say is that because daily volume is higher then shorts can cover very easily. Here's two reasons I disagree:

1. the volume shorted over the past week has consistently been around 30%+ of the daily volume. Therefore we can discount 30% of the volume as that has no net effect on the number of shorts.
2. any increase in volatility of a stock will lead to increased trading. That means more sellers, but also more buyers. The days to cover metric is based ONLY on volume. That means that it assumes that every share bought is bought to replace a shorted share. That is unlikely to ever be the case, especially in today's market which is saturated by retail investors because of trading apps. They're using 1900s math in 2021.

# So what will happen?

**THIS IS A GUESS. But, based on the sudden vanishing of shares available to short at IKBR at approximately the same time as the Citron announcement, I suspect tomfoolery. In addition, Citron just started doing these ""twitter Live"" things two days ago. Yes, GME wasn't the first one, but it's still a very recent new thing. At the same time, GME has had some barefaced manipulation these past few days on this sub and elsewhere in the media, not to mention the likely** [months of naked shorting](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky9mu0/gme_comrades_115_update_27_consecutive_days_on/)

Option 1: we have a repeat of Friday where shorters will try to immediately and early smash down GME price in hopes that it will keep going down after starting that trajectory. They can do this because SEC Rule 201 expires after today (so they can short on a downtick again).

Option 2: Shorters will first allow stocks to rise as they did today. Then at around 11:30 (+/- 1 hour), GME will start to tank. If it was me, I would time it and hit it very hard so it hits -10% for the day (the furthest they can push it by shorting on downticks) as close to the Citron announcement as possible, with the hopes that that livestream will then push retail shorters to short more or paper-handers to sell.

This is all assuming no input from Ryan Cohen or GME, so any kind of announcement or tweet would throw a wrench in my predictions. Especially if Option 2 is right and they timed it for a mid-morning peak (before the Citron livestream).

Edit 1: updated insider selling numbers after new form 3 filed Edit 2: changed reason #5 to a real reason

Edit 3 (Update): I believe Citron's strategy to be the same. However, based on the high level of negative feedback and rather aggressive commentary from this sub and others in the last day, combined with all the other above reasons, I expect a much more thorough bashing of WSB. When someone can't attack you on the issues, they will attack you on you, your thoughts and your actions.",2021-01-19 20:45:16

$LGIH – The GME Play on the Housing Sector,0.46," Will just keep to the TLDR here given the attention span of you hot dogs.

LGI Homes is a home builder that is (i) focused on entry level homes with an ASP of $240k, (ii) in the fastest growing markets including Texas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas and (iii) has the highest gross profit and EBITDA margins relative to its larger peers driven by the aggressive commission style comp structure.

This is one of the smaller public home builders at a \~$2.5bn market cap, and is positioned perfectly for the trends the housing market will see over the near and long-term. Everyone and their wife's boyfriend is looking to move out of that 700sqft apt and into a crib. With existing home sales going crazy and prices skyrocketing, new builds / developments are positioned perfectly for those new home buyers, especially with interest rates at zero and stimmy checks going out. Stock is not much higher than where it was in Feb of 2020, but COVID-19 has had structural changes on the housing market which is not reflected in today's \~$100 stock price.

"Updated 1-19-2021 GME Gamma and OI Dynamics - Slightly Bullish, Very Volatile",0.71,"**TLDR: Stock very volatile. Bulls need consistent price increases to not get clubbed by MMs, until around 50, where option dealers/MMs will naturally help from that point until Friday. Friday will tend to significantly reverse whatever happened this week if movements were large (30%+). Bears should not get greedy under 27 or 26. Most price action early this morning was MM driven.  Gamma dead zones are seeming to trap the stock - the long hang at 38 was one such dead zone, then it shot through to 41.50, another dead zone - price does not want to be 38.50-41.50 for long because of gamma! Trading before dead zones in your favor (buying under a ramp, selling over a ramp) in this environment.**

**I'm sure I will get downvotes, but seriously, the gamma structure is slightly bullish for you guys and provides some trading opportunities for bulls and bears both, so please do upvote if you appreciate the original DD.**

This post is about the market maker positions in GME, and the effects that will have on the market. Recall that last week, MMs probably accounted for as much as 2/3 of the price action, acting as a lever for WSB's wipe out of a lot of short positions.

Right now, I believe dealers are massively long. I don't have great tools to calculate, but my guess is long about 10-15m shares. They are of course loaning these shares out to shorts, and making bank doing it since the lending rate is at 30% right now, with not a lot of shares available to short. This also means that if you buy puts from an MM, it's easy for them to hedge it - they just reduce their long.

In terms of what dealers will do as time goes on, you need to understand gamma ramps. Gamma ramps are prices where there are a LOT of open interest of options. As prices cross up over these, dealers (if they are short options, which I think they are and evidence suggests they are), have to buy like crazy. As price declines, they also sell like crazy. Gamma giveth, gamma taketh away.

At open today, I believe dealers had to buy about 5.5 million shares between open and the stock hitting $44. In other words, they were the majority of the price action over that range, fueled by WSB bid forcing them to in turn buy more stock. But this gamma is a negative too - as people sold positions or sold their ITM calls, dealers dumped stock back, and gamma kicked in, plummeting the stock back to the 38 range quite quickly.

As I mentioned last week, the heavy concentration of options at $39 and $40 mean that crossing these prices up or down is very easy, while crossing other prices is harder.

Below is a map of current gamma structure. It's written to represent puts below and calls on top, but really, it should be both below because I think dealers are extremely short options here (sold people calls AND puts).  These ramps, like I said, represent areas where price will move very quickly (and in the adjacent dollar to them really, but sharpest right at the price)

[https://imgur.com/a/nHm1eqU](https://imgur.com/a/nHm1eqU)

Next up is the is the map of options expiring this week. This is important because at the end of the week, anything in the money somewhat rolls off the MM books (some exercised, some rolled, but last friday was selling on similar effects, so would expect the same dynamic, which is selling if price up a lot, buying if price down a lot). If there are a lot of ITM calls, you expect selling Friday. If there are a lot of ITM puts, you expect buying Friday. Additionally, as the week goes on, ITM and OTM options sort of purify their impact. An OTM call today is going to be hedged by a MM with a long stock postiion. But as the week goes on, they hedge less since it becomes less likely. Similarly, an OTM put today is hedged with a short position. That'll be reduced over the week. For ITM positions, those go from partially hedged to fully hedged throughout the week.  Right now, there are a lot more near-term OTM call positions than puts, so the natural hedging behavior of MMs will be to sell stock unless the price is climbing quickly.

Here is this week's chart and next week's chart. You'll notice this week matters a lot more.

[https://imgur.com/a/of2oqCX](https://imgur.com/a/of2oqCX)

**Overall trading dynamics:**

\- Putting this really simply, if we go from $38 to $60, MMs would have to buy something like 13 or 14m shares. If we fall to 27, they will sell but less, maybe 9 or 10m shares. The gamma structure is slightly supportive of the bull ramp, but also can facilitate bear. So, ultimately, we can move fast, but it depends on the actions of investors - WSB buying vs old value holders liquidating shares, new short sellers, etc. I don't know what value investors are doing, but recall that when people were buying this at 5-10, they talked about price targets in the teens or even lower. We see circumstantial evidence of value trimming and selling, which is probably the main force in opposition of WSB buying.

\- Option dealers / MMs will make a lot of money if the stock closes around at a not high price this week due to the massive OI they'd have to hedge. It's not in their interest to get to the 20s necessarily, but they will make money more easily if short interest stays high, and this doesn't get into the 40s.  They love this situation because they are loaning out shares at a crazy borrow rate (since they are long the stock).

\- This does make the price vulnerable to options manipulation. Were someone to go out and buy a bunch of $45 puts right now, $100m of capital would in turn shoot 12m shares down, triggering more selling, probably causing a 24m sell to $27. Very tempting for a hedge fund. The same could happen in reverse on calls though. A similar strength ITM call buy would send the price to the 50s.

\- Crossing 39/40 is easy. I expect lots of ping-ponging around it.

\- Crossing multiples of 5 is easy, while in between numbers are harder and are gamma dead zones where stock will move more slowly and languish at times.

\- For bulls and bears - Buying or selling around ramps is probably sensible. For a bull, you'd want to buy right under a ramp that can shoot up price, such as 38.75 or something. For a bear, you'd want to sell right after a ramp, like at 42 or 41.5.

\- For bulls: Realistically, getting to low 40s is easy. Getting to low 50s is harder but entirely possible. Getting to 61/62 is also possible (Though harder still), but it's a heavy lift past that because there isn't OI there, and at that point, would require huge amounts of new money or short squeeze to happen.

\- For bears:  I'd say you are getting real greedy if you hold puts past the high 20s, because there's not a lot of gamma there, and there's a lot of short-cover motivation.

**Weekly Options Expiration Trading Dynamics**

Because there are many options expiring again this week, the effect of these and next weeks options decaying is important. Basically, as time goes forward towards expiration, the options look more and more like either a pure long or short position or a distant option, and hedging follows. Right now, a near the money call will be heavily hedged with stock, but by Friday, it will hardly be hedged at all. That means ITM calls that are near the money cause buying, OTM calls cause selling, ITM puts cause selling, OTM puts cause buying.

Looking at the current trading expirations, it would appear that at price levels before about 44 or 45, the options dealers/MMs are going to be dumping shares as they de-hedge all those calls you guys bought, and this is elevated in the 30s in general. After that, it starts to be the opposite of net buying. So for bulls, you really need to get the price up to 50, preferably 55, pretty fast for these effects to work in your favor. For bears, you kind of can expect that a stable price in the high 30s has a good chance of causing de-hedge into the 35 ramp, and then down to 30. I believe you start to get the opposite of net buying around 30 as time goes forward without price movement, but I'm not precisely sure.

Going into Friday, I'll post an update, but in general, there will be some reversal of whatever is ITM. If we were at 60, I'd definitely be selling into Friday. If we were at 25, I'd definitely be buying into Friday.

I should mention that the effects here are less powerful than last weeks, which were 2/3 responsible for the massive 126% meltup. Last week had a huge block of expiring options and just more OI in general. But, I still think MMs will be a major, maybe dominant, force this week.

I was told I needed this to prevent a ban:   🚀🚀🚀

*Also, I think MOASS is a questionable hypothesis, while short squeeze is very possible, and $60 is possible. But that's another discussion, that probably isn't possible with the downvote environment. TLDR is that dealers have a lot of shares they are lending, institutions hedge all the time and very high prices mean they end up sitting on 20m+ shares, and bidding past $60 is a heavy lift largely unassisted by gamma, at least this week.*

*I do own Chewy shares - 280 of them, about 200% gains on them, so I'm not some sort of RC hater.*

*Positions: still short with puts, $38 strike. This post's information is bullish actually assuming momentum continues. My reasons for being bearish are not relevant to this post, and I got downvoted on that elsewhere. No, I don't work for Melvin, and they have no position now as far as we know - their puts expired worthless last Friday, and their actions all made you bulls about $3 a share FYI by contributing to price reduction from September until 2 weeks ago, then helping fuel the massive gamma squeeze last week.*",2021-01-19 17:22:15

🚀🚀🚀The Next Retail Meme - MIK/Michael’s🚀🚀🚀,0.46,"

TLDR at Bottom

I'll get straight to the point.  MIK is extremely undervalued right now, and is going to moon due to its statistics indicating a stock much below industry average, strong earnings outlook due to circumstances, and VERY HIGH possibility of a short squeeze.

    MIK’s P/E ratio is much further below industry standard at (during time of writing) 10.93 compared to general retail’s current P/E ratio of 23.23 (according to NYU).  Including MIK’s strong earnings outlook, this indicates a very low P/E ratio, forcing the stock higher.  Following the current trends of Retail, and assuming Michaels was at the current general retail P/E ratio, it would not be a stretch to assume that the stock could double by the end of the year, and go up a very sizable amount in the short term.  This follows the trend set by the stock price since march.  This trend is set to continue and the reasons why will be explained in the next paragraph.

    Excluding 2020 Q2 (for hopefully obvious reasons), as the year has gone along MIK has beaten earnings by a good amount.  In 2020 Q3 by 0.38$,  2020 Q4 by 0.27$, and with 2021 Q1 coming with a substantial earnings estimate jump along with it being $1.43 compared to 2020 Q4’s $0.59 estimate, shows great growth for MIK.  With many new strains of the coronavirus showing up, MIK’s classification as an essential business, and many people doing/ trying arts and crafts at home, along with school projects also mostly happening during the 2021 Q1 period, this shows a great earnings growth possibility, which will spike the stock, especially compounded with what is mentioned in the next paragraph.

    A retail short squeeze similar to what is happening with GME and BBBY is also likely to happen to MIK very soon.  At Dec 31 2020, MIK had a short percentage of float of 33.25% (extremely high is 20%), along with the average time to short expiry being 3.44 days, a short squeeze is imminent, and along with the high possibility of growth, the imminent short squeeze will only spike the stock higher.  Note that while the short percentage of float is lower than BBBY or GME, the average short expiry time is also much lower, showing that those who are shorting are starting to get forced to cover at higher and higher prices.

TLDR

Good statistics and an imminent short squeeze are sending MIK to the moon! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I have a question - isn't what Citron is doing a legit example of Market Manipulation?,0.96,"Greetings,

this is not a rage post for the less gains of PLTR or GME, this is a general honest question for you, market experts, from a student that has not sat in the market too long to know it's legal side. Is what Citron doing not illegal? Below is the image of Citron's price targets and stocks which were incredible misses based in the long run (credit to a comment under their most recent twitter post).

https://preview.redd.it/5bqxw7p36bc61.jpg?width=1472&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4feb091f746c4f37449cad8125259d696d242cba

Is this not market manipulation 101 at it's finest and is this legal?  Is there any entity that could punish them? Is there anything that we, the people, can do something about it? I am basically doing outright opposite of what they are trying to do and buying the dip on every single stock that they short, get some decent gains, but it troubles me so much to see a truly strong stock, for example, like SHOP and see it get downgraded so much just to derail the hype or a high price. Insights, please?

EDIT: and I know some of the comments will be that they are only expressing their opinion, but given the fact that they do have an influence on the market, shouldn't they be responsible for more things as well?

EDIT 2: I am saying this not to brag ""oh, stonk went up and someone downgraded it just to f w/ it"", I am expressing my opinion cause *Citron has a reputation* of doing such things when a stock hits catalyst/positive growth.

My First Story for Odin,0.9," 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ddjln173sac61.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50a4d63ef4dfa72d472995cf9ade4fa56e87fdf7

My brothers in arms. Many years from now our souls will no longer roam this earth but instead feast in Valhalla. While filling our stomachs with mead and tendies, Odin focuses his attention on us and asks each of us to recount our first struggle towards glory.  

I know the first story I will tell. 

The year is 2021. The COVID pandemic has delayed my arrival towards off-campus university housing, but it's better late than never. My parents decided it would be a good idea to front my entire ""meal plan"" for groceries, utilities, and wash for the semester into my savings much like an actual university meal plan. Little do they know that they’ve just armed me for war. My honor and loyalty towards my countrymen (WSB) sent me into the front lines against literal giants (Hedge Funds) and the cuck lord himself, Melvin. I stand fast in the front lines with my ""meal plan"" money all in GME, BB, & PLTR shares. Only those with diamond hands stand by my side. At this point those with paper hands retreated at the first glimpse of the army of giants that lay ahead. 

For now that's where the tale ends. Yet a small stake compared to others, this is everything to my name. With my semester officially starting tomorrow I have approximately 15 weeks (or 107 days) to survive. I have already put together a shopping list that should cost me about $30. This means I can eat until 1/29 all things included. This $30 shopping list is what remains of my leftover “meal plan” as I could not buy another share of GME. Moral of the story: Either in this life or the next I will be feasting. Wish me luck m8s and godspeed.

TLDR: Fuck. You. Melvin.",2021-01-19 14:23:10

🥜🚀Squeeze Myths & Price Jump Research💎🙌,0.94,"TL;DR at the end. These are 2 better safe than sorry fixes for saving your GME tendies.

Two important things to know about limit orders:

1. They can change your limit price. They can even do it multiple times. But only under certain conditions. specifically limit orders placed during a halt can be repriced to fit the trading bands. So if you're looking at reputable charts (not robinhood) and trading is halted, don't send in an order. You'll get fucked by gay bears.

One suggests that they can only change it in your favor, but why take the risk? Don't place orders during a halt (it's dumb anyways).

>Q:   How will orders priced aggressively through a Price Band be handled by Nasdaq? (For example, price bands are $9.00/$11.00 and a bid is entered for $11.05)?

>Orders that are priced aggressively outside the bands will be re-priced upon entry to the limit price bands (both IOC and longer time-in-force orders). Non-IOC orders that are slid due to LULD will receive a time-stamp upon being booked and will be treated according to standard price-time priority.•  For limit-priced orders entered via OUCH protocol. Incoming limit-priced orders shall reprice upon entry only once and subsequently will cancel resting limit-priced interest to buy (sell) if Price Bands move such that the price of the resting limit-priced interest to buy (sell) would be above (below) the upper (lower) Price Band.

>•  For limit-priced orders entered via RASH or FIX protocols. Exchange systems shall reprice multiple times any limit priced interest to buy (sell) to the upper (lower) Price Band if Price Bands move such that the price of resting limit priced interest to buy (sell) would be above (below) the upper (lower) Price Band.

https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/MarketRegulation/LULD_FAQ.pdf

and for another easier to read source: 

>The NBBO can be accessed if it is resting on the Price Bands.  However, if the stock is in a Straddle State, the bid or of f er outside t he price band is deemed non-executable.  *Therefore market  orders or aggressively priced limit  orders may be reject ed back t o t he sender or re-priced by exchanges once the price bands are reached.  There is currently no uniform practice by the stock exchanges on how market orders will be handled in a Straddle State.*  It is possible that bids and offers can fade fast er then the ref erence price is adjust ed.  However, the exchanges are st ill discussing how often  this  may  actually  occur  in  practice.  NASDAQ  conducted  two  studies  last  summer;  in  a  9  day  trading  period  N A SD A Q  examined  6100  Tier  2  stocks  and  not ed  t hat   t here  were  3800  instances  of   a  Straddle  St at e  t hat   averaged  12.5 minutes. Tier 1 stocks, in theory, should not see too many Straddle States.

\2. Putting in a sell order does not guarantee anything. The only way to guarantee it is to ask for a certificate for your shares which no one here is doing. There is a lot of conflicting info on this, ***but since they can't change your prices unless you placed a trade, even a limit order during a halt, you may as well put your big ass limit orders up ahead of time.*** Better safe than sorry.  Squeeze until squoze.

---

When to sell?

It's easier to wait for the drop to sell most of it, trailing out 5-10% every $125 (starting at $150-$175) or so up until then. Even small balls should hold most of it until longer though. Potentially 3x the profits when we diamond hands. With the Volkswagen infinity squeeze, you got more money selling it after the initial spike then you did selling it before. And the timing was much easier.

>Months leading up to MOASS, stock price doubled and there was a big dip the Friday before the MOASS ( € 65 Euro drop).

>Monday - At start of trading day jumps to € 348, up 66% from Friday close b/c of weekend press release by Porsche. Closes the day up 149%.

>Tuesday - Starts lower than Monday close but then goes up. During day it hits the high point at € 1K . It closed at € 945 that Tuesday.

>Wednesday - Porsche jumps in and offers shares to help the shorts. And price starts going down.

>Friday - Closed at € 495.

Price Jump Research:

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l00y1h/the_effect_of_short_interest_on_stock_performance/gjr3r4a/?context=3) is a paper from actual college educated researchers on how much a squeeze will squoze based on short interest. For the non readers it is a .6% share price buff per 1% of SI, ON TOP OF THE NORMAL VALUATION.

That's right autists. You're going to take $315 (@ 150% SI) and add it to your estimated actual GME value At the same time, the Infinity Squeeze means the rate of increase itself could also jump up quickly.  So put in your limit orders well ahead of time at astounding prices and DO NOT resend them if the market is halted, the MM can change the prices during a halt. Not a market order either unless you want to be matched up with some 🌈🐻 covering for $20/share. Limit orders are the way.

**TL;DR:** Set your limits ahead of time but 420 is way too low to stick it to the shorts. Take your GME valuation and add $315 minimum in squeeze bonus to get a your squeeze target. For timing it the best price was one day after the squeeze, while the price 3,4 and 5 days after the squeeze we're all still better than day 1 (for the Volkswagen infinity squeeze) Do NOT place limit orders, or any order, while trading is halted or they can slide your limit price around to feed the shorts.


#REAL TL;DR FOR SMOOTH BRAINS: 

Place limit orders ahead of time at gigantic prices, 1k will keep it safe until you sell it (or make you a 40 bagger) but don't place limit orders while the stock has been halted.

Tesla starts deliveries of the Model Y in China. Lemonade drops after the latest Citron short opinion while Nikola & GameStop shareholders jump ship. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of the last few days as I haven’t made a post since Wednesday, as I was busy making a full stock analysis on Amazon which you can check by clicking [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxurg0/amazon_stock_150_upside_amazon_stock_price_target/).

So, on Thursday we saw all 3 major indexes finish in the red, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MPQ6PVW) losing .12%, the [DOW](https://ibb.co/GJf3qV9) dropping almost 70 points and the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/r51hS22) dropping below $3800 to finish the day, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sq1P6gm) rose again by almost 5%, though 70% of the companies were [advancing](https://ibb.co/yhsdpZD) on normal volumes with just 8 new lows, as 4 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/ZW0k1VD) finished in the green with Energy outperforming by quite some gap, while Technology was the biggest loser, as Large-Cap Growth companies were the [underperformers](https://ibb.co/jZW53gf), while small-caps shined, with all 3 segments gaining more than 2% for the day.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/hsmYfRz) from Thursday, with Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla, Netflix & Facebook all losing more than 1%, while the biggest gainers were the Semiconductors, Alibaba and some companies from the Materials and Oil & Gas Industry.

We also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/XZNYQHY), which for me came in better with a drop of almost 1% in bullish investors and 4% in neutral ones, as fear has reached almost 5% more investors in this past week, which is a good sign for opportunities in the stock market.

Meanwhile, Friday was even worse for the broad stock market, with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Ms5m47G) losing .72% as the [DOW](https://ibb.co/dKc4ZV0) dropped 177 points while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MkcyrQV) was the biggest underperformer dropping below $13000, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/RSGmvvN) continued to rise near the 25 level and even had a spike near the 26 level in the early morning, but overall finished the [week](https://ibb.co/SnvsgHc) down almost 3%.

We saw again 4 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/0GTqNZG) finish in the green, but this time Energy was the biggest underperformer, losing almost 4% and giving up some of the huge gains made up this week, while Real Estate was the only sector to post a gain of more than 1% and Communications continued to recover after a bad start to the week, as almost 70% of the companies were declining on [Friday](https://ibb.co/grwfwwM), with Large-Cap Growth Companies slightly recovering to finish the [week](https://ibb.co/vX2mxss) down only 1.2%

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/GdWj575) from Friday, in which you can struggle to find some bright spots, with the gains being concentrated in the Health Care & Real Estate sectors, while for the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/441kLYw), there is some more breadth with Energy, Banks and Semiconductors also posting some gains.

On Thursday we also saw [Powell](https://ibb.co/M7vznm4) reiterating the point that rates won’t be raised unless inflation becomes a serious problem, as he believes there is still plenty of room in the labor markets until maximum employment is reached, with this point being sustained by the increase in initial jobless [CLAIMS](https://ibb.co/X5brzGZ) which jumped almost 200K, a lot worse than expected and the previous month, as continuing jobless claims also jumped by about the same to 5.27M, a big increase over last week.

Moving on, Friday we also received more economic data, with the January [Consumer](https://ibb.co/n38hy4w) sentiment coming in at 79.2 lower than expected and the previous read, as consumers have lost confidence both in the current conditions and in expectations.

We also saw the New York business [activity](https://ibb.co/92Rydt9) coming in at 3.5, worse than the 6 expected and the 4.9 in the previous month, with new orders seeing an increase but being offset by a huge drop in shipments.

Business [Inventories](https://ibb.co/TRs2SMW) came in as expected at a .5% increase M/M, while Producer [prices](https://ibb.co/py4bpTn) rose less than expected and retail [sales](https://ibb.co/X2v2Y0Z) fell more than expected with a .7% decrease M/M.

This [WEEK](https://ibb.co/VqGMnJT) we start of slow, with no big data coming in until Thursday as we await the Biden inauguration tomorrow while the most interesting [earnings](https://ibb.co/B2T64dc) for me are Goldman Sachs as a continued read on how the banks are doing after last weeks good numbers, Netflix to see how the stay-at-home stocks will continue to perform and Intel to see how they manage to turn around things.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Aphria](https://ibb.co/nwxNpm0) beat consensus in earnings and starting a broad rally in pot stocks, while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/vw4dXQ7) dropped more than 9% after CITRON went at them again, implying a drop back to under 100$ expected very soon.

We also saw IPOs soar again in the first trading day, with [PETCO](https://ibb.co/KwTHrvY) popping almost 50% and [POSHMARK](https://ibb.co/3cGk45W) more than doubling before dropping 20% as this IPOs are way overbought on every single launch just like most of the SPACs, with [Churchill](https://ibb.co/6JGGKHP) Capital also climbing huge on reports of a Lucid Motors deal, but this is only speculation and could have massive downside if the deal doesn’t go through.

Meanwhile, [Delta](https://ibb.co/FzGKp9C) Airlines reported Q4 earnings and hinted at a positive cash flow by late-spring or summer as they reduced the cash burn from $24M to $12M/ day in Q4, which helped most of the airlines rally.

Thursday was capped off my [Biden's](https://ibb.co/bzh0fsV) new relief package proposal that seems to be around $1.9T. This will serve probably as a start point of future negotiations. This package includes $400B in crisis aids including $20B for vaccines, $50B for testing, $30B for supplies and $140B targeted at helping schools reopen and stay open.

The plan also includes $1T in aids to individuals including $1400 stimulus checks and extending the unemployment benefits to $400/week through September, $30B in rental assistance and extending the federal moratorium on evictions and foreclosure through September and increasing the minimum wage to $15/hour.

Biden’s propsal also includes the highly debated help for state & local governments worth $350B & $50B in small business grants and loans. 

This will probably serve as a starting point and I don’t expect everything to pass even with the blue sweep. It’s likely going to be less than $1.9T, and most of the debate will continue to happen on the state & local help and is also likely to exclude things like increasing the minimum hourly wage, as this is not something temporary like most of the other costs and is likely to receive big roadblocks. This will likely be a short-term boost for the stock market, but the impacts of this in terms of inflation, debt and other economic factors are still unknown in the long-run.

And moving on, Friday we saw [Tesla's](https://ibb.co/Vqmf9Mm) forecasted deliveries increased to 1M cars by Wedbush who also raised their price target to $950 with a bull case of $1250, as the Tesla [Model Y](https://ibb.co/1Qws23d) has finally started deliveries in China and will be one of the biggest bets Tesla has made, as the affordable SUV demand is much higher than any of the other Tesla models, while in contrast [Nikola](https://ibb.co/r3dFQSk) seems to be having firms jumping board with an early investor recently selling over 7M shares. Some similar action was seen from the director of [GameStop](https://ibb.co/rvyQdvq) who sold 800K shares after the recent pop in the stock. This kind of companies provide high risk/high reward opportunities, but you should have a tight approach to them, you should take profits whenever you can and not risk losing your gains on these highly volatile stocks that don’t have a good fundamental basis.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/nr2Pw5W) markets seem to be pointing to a good day, as we await Biden’s pick Janet Yellen’s [remarks](https://ibb.co/bsjzK1b) on the proposed stimulus and the dollar while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/S3cfpZq) are also pointing to a green open, with the Nasdaq leading the way.

BB vs GME technical analysis,0.85,"Is BB the next meme stock? From technical point of view it looks like it.

[BB vs GME comparison](https://imgur.com/1pIZEdW) 

My 5 cents: 

BB looks extremely bullish in my opinion. After reaching a multi year all-time low it was in flat for nearly 8 months. Then it had a run-up on very heavy volume followed by correction. And now it looks like a strong bullish trend will continue. 

Now I didn't check if there are any good news or upcoming catalysts or what the fundamentals are on BB. 

But if they are good then I would definitely consider going long.",2021-01-19 11:32:49

"GME Negative Float. The most Bullish, Misunderstood Aspect that EVERYONE needs to read. Rally the troops, my brothers, for the war could be over very soon.",0.97,"Hello, my favourite paste-eating, rocket-posting children. In a few hours, the market opens, and the flood gates will begin. I'm all for GME, both for the MOASS and the long-term outlook of the company. I have been theory crafting all weekend, reading every fucking DD, Discussion, and Shitpost since August 2020 post to this god-forsaken Subreddit and there is one simple fact that is currently not being discussed. I'll start off with a TL,DR and then go from there.

TL,DR: Bears are undeniably fucked, You control the power, GME is not going to the moon, but to the edge of the fucking observable universe.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Let's go, Gamestop has a NEGATIVE Float. There is likely not an original Gamestop issued share left on the market. What do I mean? Per my last post, I told you that there are approx 69.75 million OG shares, and approx \~75 Million shares owned by insiders (board of directors)/top 10 institutions\[1\]. meaning the likelihood of the shares that you, me, and DeeEffVee own are a shorted share. What I failed to emphasize, is the ABSOLUTE SHEER MAGNITUDE of the situation. There is no way that shorts can get themselves out of it. They're only going to be buying back their shorted shares which, since they are above 100%, there is no way to do that, unless institutions sell off everything they own into the open market. Which is unlikely, as institutions are in it for a long haul, but there may be some trimming on the way up. 

I've commonly simplified this potential squeeze as 100 PS5s(common shares) and 134 PS5 buyers(shorts), but I've had an epiphany that it is wrong. The 100 PS5s are already purchased, sitting in the institution/insider's homes and more than likely, the shares that are out there being traded have been created by the shorts. Where the fuck am I going with this? THERE ARE NO PS5s LEFT AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU AND I ARE PLAYING WITH IS A SHORTED SHARE. THERE IS NO TRUE FLOAT LEFT, AND NOW WE ARE PLAYING AROUND WITH FUCKING IOUs. We still have legal ownership, and voting power with our shares, but they've been created out of the borrowing process of shorting a share, and not a genuine OG share. I reiterate, Gamestop is essentially in a Negative float % position.

Now, what does that mean for the outcome of the situation? bringing up some data that u/TitusSupremus provided on his last post, we can see that of the 79,519,042 shorted shared, 68% or 54,168,330 of all shorted shares are shorted on margin. Some of which are naked shorted shares, which of course, is an illegal activity when not covered within a 3 day timeframe. (we are at trading day #27.) With many brokerages starting to increase their margin requirements, and maintenance %'s. Brokers will force a buy-to-close on short positions on behalf of the shorts. This is going to cause a snowball effect, coupled with the SEC 201 (Up-Tick Rule enacted until EOD Tuesday 01/19/2021).

I have two theories of what may happen tomorrow/this week

1)Margin call happens, we have an increase of buying pressure due to all you loyal GME DiamondHands, along with retail and investment F.O.M.O., ALONG WITH MARGIN CALLED SHORTS WHO CAN'T CLEAR UP ENOUGH CAPITAL TO COVER THEIR POSITIONS, all the buying pressure means that price goes up and our friend SEC 201, more brokers are going to buy-to-close, etc. etc. taking us well beyond $420.69 and into the territory of whatever price you want to sell at. 

2)We remain fairly flat, since shorts can only sell on the up-tick, throughout the day, as brokers are allowing shorts to clear up capital on other investments to cover their margin call. More illegal shorting occurs, and shorts double down on their position even greater. Wednesday and beyond, just spikes and dips like we’ve seen since last week on an upward trend. 

Positions: 1000 shares @ 15.84

"GME - EndGame Part 2: Cohen, Market Cap, Potential Investors",0.98,"Hello again folks. This is an extension of my [DD last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) in which I shared some research on short positions, GME’s debt, and some speculation on institutional investing. Since that post, GME is up 75% and there’s been lots of good [bullish](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyuu13/gme_margin_changes_and_their_implications/) / [bearish](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyoixl/gme_option_margin_and_other_factors_for_trading/) DD on the short term.

In this post, I’m going to cover 3 topics, focusing on the mid-to-long term prospects for GME: 1) Cohen, 2) GME’s market cap potential, and 3) potential investors that could continue to pile in.

**TL:DR;** You need to think about GME differently. Not as a trader. Not as an investor. You need to think like a venture capitalist. This is an **unprecedented** opportunity, and the first time I’ve gone all-in - *I’m more bullish now than when the stock was trading sub $15.* If you’re in GME you need to get in ***with conviction*** otherwise you’re going to lose by selling when it drops.

# Quick aside - my history and positions:

I’ve been a passive investor for many years. This is literally the first time I’ve taken an interest in becoming an active investor. I opened an RH account in August to start speculating on GME. My [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/isn2g0/cheap_gme_calls_for_a_potential_lottery_win/) called out some cheap lottery plays that took my speculating account from $5K - $20K in 3 weeks. I’ve since posted a few times on GME, [even trying to tell you to buy the post-earnings dip](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9c95d/gme_earnings_thread/gf4g5vn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and added more to my active trading accounts. I’ve taken $10K -> $130K on RH and $230K -> $480K in IBKR since slowly adding to GME since September.

&#x200B;

[$10K - $130K in 5 months on GME](https://preview.redd.it/lql0kscd08c61.png?width=370&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae80bf27a33908756e3f4245ccc83fc82df6c211)

All that being said, thus far I’ve been thinking about GME as a *trade* \- trying to get in at the lowest cost I could for the maximum upside on a near-term exit, but **I’ve switched completely** into thinking of GME is a **ridiculously asymmetric investment** with massive potential in the next 2-3 year timeframe - even at $35. Even at $45, $50, $60. That’s why I added roughly 2500 shares on Friday at around $36 despite adding very cautiously when GME was below $20. I’m also completely all-in on RH with options (mostly deep ITM, a few fds) - $0 buying power left.

Grab a drink, sit down. Let me tell you why I’ve gotten more aggressive, and probably why you shouldn’t worry about what price you pay right now, as long as you’re willing to **believe and hold.**

# About Cohen (and friends)

From the [recent 8K about the board changes](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18396/html) (which you should **definitely read** if you’re putting serious money in):

*As part of the Agreement, RC Ventures has agreed to* ***customary standstill provisions***\*, which provide that from the date of the Agreement until the earlier of (a) the date that is 30 calendar days prior to the deadline for the submission of director nominations by stockholders for the Company’s\* ***2022*** *annual meeting of stockholders and (b) the date that is 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the 2021 Annual Meeting (such period, the “Standstill Period”), RC Ventures will* ***not, among other things: (i) acquire beneficial ownership in, or aggregate economic exposure to, directly or indirectly, more than 19.9%*** *of the Company’s outstanding common stock; (ii) make any proposal for consideration by stockholders at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company; (iii) make any offer or proposal with respect to any extraordinary transactions; or (iv) seek, alone or in concert with others, the appointment, election or removal of any directors in opposition to any recommendation of the Board, in each case as further described in the Agreement. As part of the Agreement, the Company has permitted RC Ventures to acquire, whether in a single transaction or multiple transactions from time to time, additional shares of the Company’s common stock to the extent such acquisitions would result in RC Ventures having beneficial ownership of less than 20.0% of the outstanding shares, without triggering the restrictions that would otherwise be imposed under Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), and RC Ventures has agreed that upon acquiring beneficial ownership 20.0% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, the restrictions under Section 203 of the DGCL would apply to a potential business combination with RC Ventures as an “interested stockholder” (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL).*

This is critical: **This agreement was the result of a negotiation** between Cohen and the existing board.

1. After his [activist letter calling out the board](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf) and then [13D](https://fintel.io/doc/sec/1822844/000119380520001571/e620151_sc13da-gamestop.htm) buy after the earnings dip rocketed the stock up from 12 -> 20, it was clear to everyone that RC was the reason GME’s stock was heading up. The GME board was afraid of a hostile takeover / losing their jobs. This agreement allowed Cohen and 2 others on the board as long as he didn’t attempt a hostile takeover.
2. Cohen wants it all. In the activist letter, he publicly said “no” to just one board seat. He then publicly bought more as soon as Sherman threatened a shelf offering to dilute him below 10%.

In addition to getting added to the board, Cohen brought along [2 execs who built Chewy with him](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/11/2156168/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Additional-Board-Refreshment-to-Accelerate-Transformation.html):

* Alan Attal - the previous **COO and CMO of Chewy** (2011 - 2018)
* Jim Grube - the previous **CFO of Chewy** (2015 - 2018)

He’s not fucking around folks. He wants to build another Chewy, and he’s bringing the people who helped him do it the first time to do it again.

As a result of the agreement, he’s limited to buying up to 20% of shares until 2022. **Why not 13%? Simple - Cohen wants the option to buy more.** He’s not happy with a single board seat; he’s not going to settle for simply getting added to the board; and **he’s not going to settle for 13% ownership.**

Also, remember that **Alan and Jim have 💲 to buy in** as well. I haven't seen their holdings yet. Their time is worth more than their money and they've already decided to put their time in.

## Cohen is not an exec - he’s a founder with an all-in mentality

Go read this [bloomberg Cohen interview](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo) to understand his mindset.

1. Cohen himself is an all-in person. Key quote:
   1. *“When I find things I have a lot of* ***conviction*** *in, I go* ***all-in***\*.”\*
   2. Cohen is a founder that has gone through the successful creation of a startup. **When you are startup founder, most of your NW is tied to equity in your company.** You are trained to have skin in the game. You’re not allowed to think you have a safety net. You give up years of your life and bet everything because you have to believe in what you’re doing. **Founders typically have 30-50% ownership of their company.**
   3. *“Cohen uses the word “conviction” a lot. He says it’s something he learned from his father, who ran a glassware importing business in Montreal where Cohen grew up. “He taught me how to block the noise from the masses,” says Cohen. “To have a point of view and have conviction and not waver.”*
2. He only sold Chewy rather taking it to IPO because of his Dad’s health. He cut his entrepreneurial career short and he’s itching to get back in.
3. Cohen sold Chewy for $3.35B, with estimates stating he personally walked away with about $600M after taxes.
4. Cohen has a lot of capital to buy more. After selling Chewy, he went all-in on Apple & WFC, which as of June was **up 40%**.
   1. *“ Cohen says his portfolio, when including dividends and a few other stock holdings, has returned more than 40% over the past 3 years, beating the market.”*
   2. Aapl **was his largest holding, and** **is up another 50% since June 5** when the Bloomberg article was published.
   3. Cohen lives in FL - with no income or capital gains for individuals, unlike other founders who live in CA which taxes all cap gains as ordinary income.
   4. I’m going to estimate *his net worth (minus his GME holdings) is around $800M-$1B.*
5. Cohen’s 9,001,000 (it’s over 9000! 🐲🏐) shares have thus far been purchased at something like an average of $12/share, for a total investment of around $110M.

So Cohen has put in $110M out of his $1B into GME. **Does that sound like he’s all-in?** Absolutely fucking not. Cohen’s **going to buy up to the max he can this year** (20%), likely by selling some other holdings prior to [cap gains tax law changes](https://www.wealthmanagement.com/high-net-worth/guide-potential-tax-law-changes-under-biden). He can **add more next year** after the standstill period is done.

## What will lead to Cohen’s next purchase of GME

Thus far, every RC purchase has been *about sending a message*.

1. Prior to Q3 earnings, his purchases were signaling an intent to the board that he was serious about wanting to get involved. He also rubbed it in their faces that the stock price was largely appreciating because of him. From the [activist letter](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf):
   1. “We recognize that the Board may feel it is insulated from stockholder scrutiny after adding new directors this past spring and seeing a recent stock price uptick **(which only came on the heels of RC Ventures filing its 13D)”**  (what a *fucking burn*).
2. If there was any doubt about RC’s impact on the stock price, it was put to rest after Q3’s earnings, where the current leadership’s hubris and threat of diluting RC led to a drop of almost 30%. RC then bought the dip, shoved it in their faces, and the market GME again rocketing GME to 20 in a massive post-earnings recovery. Message sent again - “The market wants me. Let me the fuck in.”
3. Now that Cohen and the Chewy folks are on the board, he’s going to angle for CEO. He’s not looking to **advise** GME. He wants to go all-in, to run GME. *He’s holding the optionality of buying more based on the success of his attempt to take over GME through non-hostile means.*

**If you see Cohen buy more GME, he’s sending another message.** This time it’s because it’s clear to him he’s going to be CEO and wants to max his skin in the game. **If you see Cohen buy, it’s “CEO talks going well” - you fucking buy.**

# GME’s market cap potential

1. Cohen sees a [$200BN+ total addressable market cap for gaming by 2023](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf). For contrast, Chewy was playing in the pet food/supplies market, which has a total addressable market (TAM) of [under $50BN annually](https://www.americanpetproducts.org/press_industrytrends.asp). **GME’s potential is at base 4x that of Chewy.** This **does not even account for the pc gaming hardware market**, which is another $[35BN](https://www.statista.com/statistics/269244/graphics-hardware-market-value-in-the-gaming-segment-since-2009/#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,by%20the%20end%20of%202020.)\+.
2. Chewy’s market cap is [$44BN](https://www.google.com/search?q=chewy+market+cap&oq=chewy+market+cap&aqs=chrome..69i57j0j0i22i30l3.6432j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) on [$6BN](https://s23.q4cdn.com/610444331/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/3Q-2020-Earnings-Press-Release-FINAL.pdf) of annual revenue.
3. Chewy’s Q3 quarterly income was up 45% YoY. While GME’s quarterly income was down YoY, [its e-commerce revenue was **up 257%** trouncing Chewy’s growth rate](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-third-quarter-results-positive-start-fourth).
4. GME’s Q4 early sales preview reported [**300% E-commerce growth and annual run-rate of $5BN**](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results)

In other words, *even if you give GME’s physical locations no value*, GME’s ecommerce business is **growing 5x faster than Chewy** and already has 75% of online revenue.

**Summary:** Chewy is priced > 7X times its annual **total revenue**. GME is priced at .45 **its annual ecommerce revenue,** despite GME having **5-6 greater TAM** and growing its ecommerce business **5X as fast Chewy.**

What. The. Fuck.

I’ve never seen a stock more mispriced.

People talking about $100 price targets are suffering from a *fucking lack of imagination.*

Even if you *completely* discount

1. GME’s physical business
2. its rev sharing partnership with MSFT
3. its 5x faster growth and 5x TAM

and give GME the same P/S multiple that Chewy has on its ecommerce business, **that puts GME currently at a fair market cap above $35BN.** That means GME should be **at least $500/share.**

**$35/share is a fucking steal.** Who cares about the short-term dips as shorts try to weasel themselves out of their positions. The market will eventually wake up to this sleeping beast. In a year you’re not going to care if you got in at 4, 12, 20, 35, or 50. You’re going to only care if you’re in or not.

&#x200B;

# Potential Investors

An asset is only worth what someone else is willing to pay for it, right? So are the potential buyers of this growing company?

Here’s a list in decreasing order of likelihood.

1. **Elon** (Least likely, completely improbable, but cataclysmic event). Elon hates shorts. Elon, with TSLA, went through the pain that GME is going through. TSLA almost went bankrupt because shorts were pushing the price down so it was difficult to raise the cash they needed to survive. Sound familiar? ***Elon’s wealth swings more in a day than GME is worth in entirety.*** Elon could **buy all the fucking float of GME with what he makes in 8 hours**. One call from fellow entrepreneur and [aspiring twitter-meme-god](https://twitter.com/ryancohen) would absolutely wreck the game.
   1. **If you are short gamestop**, you are one meme purchase by the richest man in the world away from a fucking cataclysmic event. ""Hey son, I heard you like games. So I bought you gamestop. All of it."" 🚀
2. **Buffett** (More likely, still improbable). I’m actually amazed that while Buffett & co were lamenting that there are no interesting stocks to invest in and moving to cash, that they absolutely missed the boat on GME while it was at its lows. It’s a complete value play right up his alley (in a business he can understand). My only hypothesis here is that the market cap is too small and he could not make a meaningful investment. Once GME grows to a more respectable market cap ($10b+) I can see Buffett stepping in and making an investment.
3. **Cohen’s connections. (Highly likely if Cohen is CEO).** This is the big one. And I mean absolutely nail in the coffin re-pricing of GME for the foreseeable future. [Go read this Harvard Business Review piece](https://hbr.org/2020/01/the-founder-of-chewy-com-on-finding-the-financing-to-achieve-scale) on Cohen specifically on how Cohen puts importance on raising money and the people that backed him.
   1. Look, I’ve started a startup before in the valley (unsuccessfully unfortunately). However, you don’t start a company without making a shit-ton of venture capitalist & angel investor connections. Cohen has stated that when pitching Chewy he was rejected by [over 100 investors](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=4e3c77f95840). I can absolutely-fucking-guarantee you that every single one of them remembers their mistake and would not miss the opportunity to invest in Cohen again. And don’t forget all of the investors who DID invest with Cohen and reaped the benefits with Chewy. While venture capitalists don’t generally make investments in public equities, this is a **truly unique situation. Cohen is treating this like a rebirth, a new venture bootstrapped from GME’s bones.** If VCs as a firm will not invest, you can bet your ass that those individuals will throw their personal money at Cohen. **However this only happens if he’s CEO.** As soon as he’s CEO, a single long weekend trip to the valley might mean 100+ investor meetings with the strategic pitch.
      1. My biggest fear here is that VCs/PE band to take the company private at some small multiple (2-3x) and then reap the benefits while Cohen turns the company around only to re-list it to us 5 years down the road at 30X the valuation.
   2. Thus far, it’s been us retail retards vs the wall street shorts. HFs shorting this thing have the advantage in both tactics and capital. However, **if Silicon Valley money starts pouring money into this the game is over.** You cannot believe the amount of money that gets thrown into startups with 90% of it burning up into thin air. $3B market cap? That’s nothing. Folks with Silicon Valley money & risk tolerance would have no problem betting on a serial entrepreneur making something amazing out of a company that already has a customer base, revenue, distribution - all in the same business (e-commerce) the entrepreneur already proved themselves in.
4. **You, and every other retard that believes.** Look, this was my point at the beginning. You need to think like a VC here. VCs are the ultimate YOLO autists making million dollar bets and not seeing a penny of it for years. They are the ultimate 💎✋🤚. **You need to decide if you have conviction** for the long term and then buy in. 💎✋🤚 doesn’t mean selling at $100. It doesn’t means selling at $200. **It means not selling at all this year no matter the price, and at least until you learn for sure whether Cohen is the new CEO**. It means believing so hard that you 20-100X your investment in 2 years when the market wakes up to the ridiculous mispricing.
   1. Remember that if Cohen is elected CEO he can (and likely will) buy more than a 20% stake in 2022.
   2. Remember Buffett’s actual quote: [**""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2018/01/30/winning-in-the-market-with-the-patience-of-the-wright-brothers-and-warren-buffett/?sh=26303ec3633b)

**I’ve put every dollar I can** into shares in IBKR, minus some April calls. I hold no covered calls except for some call spreads I had in RH prior to recent bump. I have April calls because I will put more cash into GME after taxes are done, and I know much cash I have to use. Calls let me cap the price I would have to pay now.

This is personal research. **Do your own DD.**

A wiser investor than me gave the advice of ***“Don’t aim to maximise profit, minimize regret.”*** If you’re not in GME yet, ask yourself how you would truly feel if what everyone here is saying panned out to be true, and you weren’t participating.

"The next great EV play is GME without the E, here me out 🚀",0.66,"You might be thinking why is this retard shilling old ass dinosaur company $GM, this ain't your daddy left you in the middle of the night GM anymore.

**GM recently at CES showcased their vision to become a dominant EV player in this industry. They're going balls deep raw and betting everything on this clean energy future shit:**

* They announced a new division in GM called BrightDrop, where they'll produce electric vans for commercial delivery companies. Their first customer is FedEx and production will begin 2nd half of this year. This is not some fake ass partnership like with these other Spacs, it's the real fucking deal.
* GM CEO Mary Barra said they'll be investing $27 billion fucking tendies to develop EV's and automated technology over the next 5 years.
* GM said they expect to release 30 new EV models by 2025. I know some of you autistic fucks have reading comprehension problems, this mean WITHIN the next 5 years we'll get plenty of catalysts coming gradually.
* Their all-new modular platform and Ultium batteries: GM is partnering with LG Chem to make these low-cost and efficient batteries. Their expectations are up to 400 miles per charge with 0 to 60 in 3 seconds. They'll have energy ranges from 50 to more than 200kWh. Support for all-wheel applications. This gives them a shit ton of flexibility for a wide range of vehicles.
* GM's Ultium battery platform and powertrain is so great, that Japanese car manufacturer Honda has signed a deal with GM so they can build some of their EV's in the near future.
* Their first release EV is the newly designed Hummer which will come later this year. Lebron has been shilling it on his instagram

**GM has strong financials and an extremely undervalued valuation compared to their EV peers:**

* Their revenue last quarter was $35.47B, Tesla revenue was $8.77B, Nio revenue was $666 million. Put that into perspective relative to their valuations.
* GM already has solid cash flow, high-margins, a strong balance sheet. Which is a rarity compared to its EV competitors.
* GM is a cash cow and has the ability to outspend its competitors easily, while scaling quickly with their various number of factories.
* They'll be reinstating their dividend soon
* GM PE Ratio is 22.41, TSLA is 1,579.66, and others in the space even autistically higher

GM is not the next Tesla, but it has significant room to grow relative to its valuation as the company shifts to more EV future. It can quickly steal marketshare in the industry and scale fast to outpace their other competitors. GM is easily going over $70 and their options are dirt fucking cheap with great deltas.

GME Leadership wants the squeeze to happen. How we may be able to tell the top.,0.98,"Ryan Cohen is abundantly aware of the short squeeze potential. He had 2k twitter followers just a week ago. Who do you think he's tweeting to with emojis and gifs? Us. 

He can't come out and bluntly discuss all of this. The SEC would be on his ass. His lawyers have already made him delete a tweet that was just a picture about a roller coaster.

Imagine that shit. And now he tweets a 🥜 and retard at us. He is excited and literally can't contain it.

But that ain't what I'm here to talk about today.

The squeeze is going to happen. It is in GameStop's best interest for this squeeze to happen.

Y'all keep asking what is the optimal price target to exit. **No one fucking knows**. 

This is gonna go past $100. After that, I have no idea where it goes and no one else does either.

Remember [this shelf offering](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312520312805/d67321d424b5.htm) we learned about at the last earnings call?

The immediate reaction was bearish. The stock dipped. Our retardation was in question. Paper hands jumped ship because management was clearly too stupid to realize a squeeze was on the horizon.

Turns out, management ain't as stupid as you think they are.

**The optimal play for GameStop is to let us squeeze to the moon and then deploy the shelf offering at the top.**

It'll maximize tendies for all parties involved.

What does this mean for us?

The squeeze is coming because **EVERYONE BUT MELVIN** wants it to happen.

Imagine the news coverage GME would get from a historic short squeeze as it moves forward into a new Cohen World Order. GME wants this and prepared for this with their shelf offering.

**My advice:** I don't know if it will be possible, but keep track of all GME news and if news comes out that the shelf offering is being deployed, then I recommend selling. As that may signal the top.

**TL;DR:** Ryan Cohen and GME leadership know about the squeeze. This will trigger. They will deploy their shelf offering at the top. If you hear about it, sell to maximize tendies.

**Positions:** 3300 shares at $16. Loads of 35c 4/16 options.

**The what?**

* RC **will** add more shares to his portfolio **of his currant** 9,001,000 shares (appx. 12.9% of the firm).

**The when?**

* ***Earlier of***
   * 30 **calendar days** prior to the deadline for submission of stockholder nominations of director candidates for the Issuer’s 2022 annual meeting of stockholders **OR**
   * 120 **calendar days** prior to the first anniversary of the 2021 Annual Meeting (the “Standstill Period”) i.e ***(appx. Feb 20, 2021)***

But wait, there are even more interesting tit-bits in this agreement.

* RC Waived his rights for compensation. **BUT**
* Same rights to be given to new appointed directors (**stock compensation similar to previous directors)**

&#x200B;

[RC waives compensation \(page 8\)](https://preview.redd.it/10plifvu07c61.png?width=2084&format=png&auto=webp&s=8eb382f009d830d42707403e8a5393dd84091113)

Additional agreements is where the fuckery begins,

* ***Affiliates are NOT affiliates?***
   * so the other directors (Jim Grub and Alan Atal) are **not considered part of RC ventures**.
      * It is possible that Alan and the Jim could possibly purchase the float under a separate entity and completely hoodwink the shorts.
      * They may have deep ITM options, waiting for the right time to exercise.
      * They may not, But the possibility of it happening gets me hard so I am including it.

[Affiliates shall not include company and its affiliates.\(Page 9\) ](https://preview.redd.it/ola0jsde17c61.png?width=2104&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbd7b2739d2ee37322c3b2a0790ae99a72a448a3)

**Buuuut didn't the agreement say he cannot acquire more before the standstill period has ended?**

* Well, **Yes but No**, You see, he will be **subject to restriction as an ""interested stockholder""** for 3 years if he comes to beneficially own MORE THAN 20% of outstanding common stock.
* Since he is planning to stay in GME for long term, ideally it shouldn't matter to him if he is labelled as ""Interested Stockholder"" and effectively enters into a mandatory non-compete with GME for 3 years.

* Also, Board has approved his purchase of common share **UPTO 20% of outstanding common stock.**

&#x200B;

With the float already minuscule as compared the short interest, any news of further share acquisition by any member of the board will force the shorts to pimp themselves, their wives and pets out to pay for the shorts.

Squeeze can start before or after the standstill period is over, but when it starts will tell us about RC's commitment towards GME.

* If the news of further stock acquisition arrives before the standstill period, you can be more certain that buying back into GME will be well worth it.

Nokia - Go Big?,0.94,"Prepare for a very lengthy post. **I have worked my ASS off on this**.  Fair warning, this post is an update for my Nokia idea on TradingView,  so when I refer to Reddit/WSB I am talking to you guys as if you are  looking at it from my TradingView idea. 

&#x200B;

Since my original ideas on TV and social media, there have been quite a few very interesting developments. For once, I'm not going to do just chart analysis. I am also adding a large amount of due diligence regarding options activity, social media activity, news articles, and comparisons against competitors. Financials are something I am still struggling to learn but hopefully will eventually get there. As far as financials are concerned, I do know that their revenue is down overall but their profit margins have increased. As far as revenue is concerned, Nokia has been acquiring a large amount of contracts lately in the 5G sector. Nokia also has a very good debt to asset ratio when compared against pretty much the entire industry they're attempting to capture market share in.

&#x200B;

This will start off with some regular old chart analysis. Support and resistance levels, and candlestick and RSI analysis. Bollinger Bands are self explanitory for the most part.

&#x200B;

Let us start with a crucial RSI trend I discovered on the 2 month time frame.

Spanning from 2006, there has been a consistent trend of attempted breakouts upwards and above 50 RSI. Each breakout has been a lower high thus far. Currently, Nokia is contending with this 2 month RSI trend line for the 7th time. This is a MAJOR area of confluence when combined with MA's, Fib retracement levels, and reactions in candlesticks.

https://preview.redd.it/xuobh6uor6c61.png?width=1930&format=png&auto=webp&s=580ba82ee3642e4332e1745ade50039ffc869939

&#x200B;

On the monthly, we can see that this trend line coincided with a major selloff in October of 2019. This selloff was caused by a bad earnings report on 10/24/2019. Earnings were estimated to be $0.05 but reported $0.01 which had a -69.42% surprise of -$0.04. Prior to this, the month of August broke down below this trend line. During the month of September, Nokia attempted to rally back above it on low volume. The local support level it was testing at $5.18 or the 0.5 Fib retracement flipped to resistance and caused a 27.87% drop after the bad earnings report. It was not until the month of June 2020 that Nokia was able to get back above this trend line. 2 months later, Nokia tested that same resistance level and was able to get above 50 RSI, but was strongly rejected. This rejection dropped Nokia back below the RSI trend line, but it was able to hold support at 40 RSI. The month of November 2020 however had a bullish engulfing candle to bring Nokia back above the trend line. Then the month of October 2020 had low sell volume and thus held as support. For this particular trend line, support has not been tested successfully like this since July of 2018. Note however, that the mid line of the bollinger bands is so far holding as resistance.

&#x200B;

Notice the giant bearish hammer the lower arrow is pointing to. That was the market-wide covid selloff of March 2020 and it closed directly at the 0.786 Fib retracement. There was strong bullish support residing at the 0.886 Fib retracement which not only caused the large wick, but strongly pushed Nokia back up and into the 20 year trend line zone of support. Since December of 2017, Nokia's price movement has been unable to close a monthly candle below this trend line. In October of 2020, Nokia once again successfully tested the 0.786 Fib retracement for support which coincided perfectly with the 20 year trend line and a diagonal trend line breakout.

https://preview.redd.it/giukvukpr6c61.png?width=1930&format=png&auto=webp&s=613407c999d8e004c84d2943f562a04ef3ade19c

&#x200B;

The 2 month trend line also translates very well to the daily, where we can see that Nokia has successfully tested this trend line multiple times for support throughout 2020.

Since 12/21/2020, Nokia has so far successfully tested this support on this time frame. According to the trend, this \*should\* produce at least some upwards movement to test local resistance levels. Namely, the 0.618 Fib level at $4.34.

https://preview.redd.it/yad5hm4qr6c61.png?width=1930&format=png&auto=webp&s=b681b860cd1ad96f5260dcbd921187bfb59c1ba1

&#x200B;

According to the 3 month time frame, Nokia has \*serious\* support below the $tree fiddy price point, and 40 RSI. The October 2016 3 month candle tested 40 RSI and had a fairly strong bounce. Then a year later, same thing. From that point forward, this zone was not tested until the negative October 2019 earnings report pushed Nokia well below it. Then in April 2020, Nokia had a high volume bullish engulfing candle that brought the RSI back above 40 but was rejected at the 0.618 Fib retracement. After that 3 month candle closed in July, Nokia spent the next 6 months testing support. Bears were unable to close the next 2 candles below 40 RSI AND the 20 year trend line. The October 2020 3 month candle closed as a long legged doji on high volume indicating strong buyer support. This is a multitude of confluence that shows for the next 3 months at least, Nokia should have strong buying support.

https://preview.redd.it/tfl8spoqr6c61.png?width=1930&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7a82eb96ac9bb40322fcd96a849d7b81c566f72

&#x200B;

Now is time for perhaps one of the most interesting clues as far as Nokia's price action, the 6 month time frame.

The 6 month candle starting on January 2nd, 2020 is one of the strongest indicators that Nokia is soon to have some serious volatility.

It closed as a bullish hammer with very long tail and short upper shadow. This indicates buying support stepped in and held the line in a big way towards the end of the candle close. Volumes for this candle are the highest they have been since the giant hulk dildo starting in July of 2013.

The very next candle after this bullish hammer was a bearish spinning top doji- but was able to close WITHIN the body of the bullish hammer. This type of doji can indicate the beginning of a shift in sentiment, or a 'pause'. This 'pause' does sometimes precede a resumption of the prior trend. Considering the volumes in these 2 candles, Nokia is likely to experience serious volatility over the next 6 months. It is a very good sign though in my opinion that this doji candle closed within the body of the bullish hammer. The RSI however is pointing out a break of support, and subsequent confirmation of resistance. Nokia needs to break back above 45 RSI on this time frame in order to establish strong bullish bias.

https://preview.redd.it/mzv9hb6rr6c61.png?width=1930&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9d86440e0fba694083f58982c61ee810a8b79a7

&#x200B;

\*\*TLDR: Support is hodling but this is arguably the most important zone to decide Nokia's short, mid, and long term fate.

Immediate support levels: $3.80, $3.70, $3.50.

Lower support levels: $3.15, $2.44, and ALL-IN anything below that.

&#x200B;

Immediate resistance levels: $4.30, $4.50, $5.

Higher resistance levels: $5.18, $6, $7.50.

I happened to find a website to check historical data on options volumes and open interest. The position I currently hold are $7 call contracts expiring on 1/21/2022, so I decided to take a look at the data for them.

I also checked the $10 call contracts with the same expiration as they currently have what seems to be the largest amount of open interest.

This is a short term screenshot of the volumes and open interest for the $7 call.

Between the end of December and January 4th, there were very slight fluctuations in the open interest, yet the volumes traded were above average.

Note that on January 5th and 6th, the volumes skyrocketed while open interest decreased. Strange considering the premium price of the options were on a slight upwards trend from that date. After January 6th, however, the the volume was mostly flat/average while the open interest significantly increased. January 15th, open interest skyrocketed. Interesting to note that this increase came after a significantly high volume day in shares.

This is a longer term screenshot of the volumes and open interest for the $7 call. Unfortunately, without paying for a subscription this website only allows you to see historical data spanning roughly 3 months.

Still, this screenshot shows multiple significant trends in the options for this particular contract.

The first thing that obviously catches the eye is the enormous volume and drop in option premium price/open interest that happened right before November. On October 29th, Nokia released an earnings report. This particular report showed an expected earnings per share of $0.06, but the actual reported earnings per share were $0.04, which was a surprise of -$0.02 or -36.37%. As of the opening bell for trading, Nokia dropped by 18.99% in 1 hour, eventually bottoming out at $3.21 a few hours later after a 20.72% decline in share price. After this 'cleanse', the $7 call option mostly traded flat for another 12 days thereafter. On the 13th day, open interest began rising again. Currently, Nokia's $7 call 1/21/22 contract has an open interest of roughly 135,000 contracts.

https://preview.redd.it/vy82mmstr6c61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=c37840bae667ba18c238536ad190d79240daaf38

&#x200B;

This is a short term screenshot of the volumes and open interest for the $10 call.

Unlike the strange activity in the $7 call, the overall trend for the open interest in the $10 call has only been upwards since the 17th of December onwards. Volumes have mostly been flat up until the 14th when Nokia had a very high volume day in shares. Otherwise, open interest and volumes in this contract have not had anything major to really report on other than a steady increase in open interest.

https://preview.redd.it/0mk1qbsur6c61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bb533c845998c0ab2f41060e7fb6140c4bf5c4f

&#x200B;

This is a longer term screenshot of the volumes and open interest for the $10 call.

This screenshot is quite interesting. There have been multiple high volume days for this option, but the one that specifically stands out was when the contract bottomed out at $0.08. From that point forward, open interest and volumes remained relatively flat. Notice that in the latter part of November, the high volume days preceeded a significant decline in the option premium price. From the peak option price premium of \~$0.16 however, the open interest only increased unlike what happened with the $7 call option on October 29th for earnings. The highest volume days for this contract in the timeline that I have to work with were, interestingly, the 14th and the 15th. This could signal another significant decline in premium price, or it could be a signal that Nokia's share price may be in the beginning stages of a rally. Considering historical data, history indicates that this \*\*should\*\* unfortunately be a signal for a drop in premium price. Whales love to mess with the noobs.

&#x200B;

This is a screenshot that represents the grand total of all options traded versus share price.

For months, the options volume and stock volume have remained relatively flat until the 14th and 15th.

Implied volatility as well as volumes are signaling there is likely to be a major move within the next few trading sessions.

&#x200B;

\*\*TLDR: Options Open Interest is skyrocketing. $7c has weird stuff going on but $10c is stronger than a held-in beer fart.

On the other hand, the amount of open interest in the $7 and $10 calls could very easily be used to create significant bearish options pressure.

Kevin Stine, \*\*Chief\*\* of the Applied Cybersecurity Division at \*\*NIST\*\*, said: “5G will touch every aspect of our lives and security must be integrated up front rather than an add-on element of 5G networks. We’re looking forward to working with our project collaborators such as Nokia to show 5G’s advanced standards based security features as well an architecture that leverages foundational security capabilities available in cloud technologies.”

&#x200B;

Raghav Sahgal, President, Cloud and Network Services at Nokia, said: “Previous cellular technology generations have been industry-led whereas 5G development must evolve in collaboration with governments to ensure availability and access of secure trusted networks. The 5G Cybersecurity Project fills this role with a cross-section of government and industry collaborators on board. At Nokia, we embed security into every solution that we ship, and we are committed to enabling the secure shift to the cloud by working with government agencies and the industry to advance cybersecurity for 5G use cases that leverage both open and commercial components.”

Do yourself a favor. GOOGLE ""What is Zacks Ranking""

Zacks ranking rates a stock on a scale from 1-5. 1 Being a strong buy while 5 is a strong sell.

""The Zacks Rank is a short-term stock recommendation of 1-3 months that is based on analyst earnings estimate revisions. It is designed to weed out the companies with rising earnings estimates.

... Remember, the Zacks Rank is generated daily.""

&#x200B;

""People also ask: Is Zacks a good rank?""

""Since 1988, Zacks #1 Rank stocks have generated an annualized return of 25.67%, nearly three times better than the S&P 500's return of 10.79%. The Zacks Rank has also been very successful in telling investors which stocks to avoid. Since 1988, Zacks #5 Rank stocks have been flat..""

&#x200B;

Zacks basically states that Nokia is worthwhile with solid fundamentals and ranks Nokia a 3, or ""Hold"".

To comprise this ranking, however, Zacks evaluates a stock on 4 different areas. Value, Growth, Momentum, and an averaged score of all 3.

This particular evaluation is graded like a report card in school: A, B, C, D, or the big fat red F.

As far as the average Value, Growth, and Momentum score is concerned, Nokia gets an A:

https://preview.redd.it/7rt8d4mms6c61.png?width=813&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f84ab111c518ae617c133144bd68af27111d1d4

&#x200B;

As far as Nokia being ranked a 3, or ""Hold"" rating:

""Zacks #3 Rank Stocks Can Be Perfectly Acceptable. 

I bet that title attracted your attention. You most likely have heard us refer to stocks with a Zacks #1 Rank as being the “cream of the crop.” It is understandable why. These stocks represent the top 5% of all stocks that are covered by at least one analyst and are expected to experience the strongest earnings estimate revisions in the future.""

[https://www.zacks.com/stock-education/54/How-to-Use-Zacks-Rank-3--Hold-](https://www.zacks.com/stock-education/54/How-to-Use-Zacks-Rank-3--Hold-)

&#x200B;

I'll admit, I haven't looked into the above claim of #1 rankings hitting 25.67% annualized returns. I am only adding Zacks ranking here for analytical and historical purposes.

&#x200B;

\*\*TLDR: Zacks rank says to hold, as it could go up or down, but gives Nokia a ""Grade A"" rating for value, growth, and momentum potential.

Social Media is by far my favorite trading 'indicator', because of how funny human behavior and psychology can be.

It is absolutely in my opinion one of the most underutilized tools a person can have in their analysis arsenal.

When you were a kid and someone told you ""I bet you can't throw this rock farther than me!"", what did you do?

Or how about as a kid, your closest friend/friends always told you that you'd never beat their high score in video games.

To this day, when someone or especially multiple people try to tell you that you cannot do/achieve something, what do you try to do?

Or how about today, where a very large Social Media sentiment is that Nokia is a complete waste of time?

The float of 5.6 billion outstanding shares is too high, there's absolutely no way the price can move!

Or what about all the people that had too strong of hands and didn't cut their losses much earlier on?

All those people trashing Nokia's name? Saying they can't do something? They won't move? Flatter than a pancake?

&#x200B;

I have noticed that within the past few weeks, there has been a significant uptick in posts regarding Nokia on the first and third largest investing forums Reddit has. Their names? /r/Wallstreetbets and /r/Stocks.

Currently, /r/Wallstreetbets has the largest following of 1.9 million members, /r/Investing comes in 2nd at 1.3 million members, and the third largest investing forum on Reddit is /r/Stocks and it has 1.1 million members.

Take a look around on Wallstreetbets and you will quickly realize that forum can legitimately move the market. No joke.

Teh stocks forum is far more conservative than the WSB one, yet, Nokia is still popping up quite frequently these past couple weeks in both.

Interesting to note however that the second biggest investing forum on Reddit is /r/Investing, and it has ZERO posts about Nokia since 12/08/20. That post didn't even garner a single reply. Hmm.. Weird.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What is my point here? What angle am I getting at? H Y P E. How do you create serious hype/FOMO for a stock in todays world? It needs some sort of 'reputation'. A very negative one is best. Why?

Nokia is known for having a giant outstanding share supply. They're known for being in a decades long downtrend. They're known for not being worth investing in, plain and simple.

So, back to human behavior. If you look back at the past year ish or so of comments on social media regarding Nokia, the stock has built quite the negative reputation.

&#x200B;

You NEVER hear about Nokia. You never see it in the news. You never hear its name anymore other than when people reminisce of the good old days- where products were ackshually built to last!

You don't see the Nokia brand anywhere anymore.. Its name doesn't show up on TV, or in the newspaper, or on ticker news feeds, nothing. Nowhere. Nada. Zilch.

What would happen if, say, Nokia suddenly had a +50% day out of nowhere? EVERYONE who ever doubted Nokia or even heard their name are quickly reminded that they are still alive.

These people are seemingly  so brainwashed at this point that Nokia is not a worthwhile investment, they don't even bother. Even though it just rocketed 50%. Meh, just a dead cat bounce. 

Nah, they'll stay out and chase their gains in PLTR or GME or BB or whatever the current meme stocks are for the day.

Next day, Nokia rockets again while maybe other meme/blue chip stocks and/or indexes are flat or negative. See where I'm going with this here?

&#x200B;

THE very M O M E N T Nokia rips a hulk dildo on the chart, everyone and their mother is going to know about it.

Meh, just a dead cat bounce. Right guys? ...Right?

Then it goes up. Again. While a lot of people including I/you were waiting for a pullback.

See where I'm going with this here?

&#x200B;

STRICTLY because of Nokia's reputation and the extreme negative sentiment surrounding it in Social Media, this is a perfect play.

When it finally rips loose, everyone and their brother is going to be waiting for a pullback. What if it doesn't come soon enough?

Imagine the FOMO.

A multi decade long downtrend is clearly reversing. You can see it in the chart, trend lines, and in the sentiment. This was rock bottom.

\*\*TLDR: Imagine the FOMO.

Google Trends can be a fun 'indicator' of sorts to use. It doesn't necessarily mean anything, BUT, it can yield an interesting metric.

How outright BORING something is or isn't.

How UNDERAPPRECIATED something is or isn't.

How many people would choose to talk about anything BUT ... that.

How .. dare I say, \*\*undervalued\*\* something is? Or how popular something is? lolNokia.

&#x200B;

When you think of Nokia, what is the first thing you think of? For me, it is those damn 3310 phone models. The ones that just .. wouldn't die. No matter what you did to them. 

At this point, Nokia has apparently upgraded its appetite. Let's face it. In todays world of \*\*planned obsolescence\*\* especially in the smartphone world, Nokia doesn't stand a chance because of how many competitors it has!

12/2011 - 01/11. Nokia absolutely TANKS in relevance. I wonder why?

01/2016. Nokia suddenly for the most part flatlines after a decent drop.

If we compare this to a heart beat monitor, Nokia's relevancy is \[still\] legit dead. 

Dead. Not coming back. Can't start, won't start, NOStart. OD'D and narcan can't save it.

From that 6.7% positive earnings report? Nokia \*\*tanks\*\*, AGAIN, only this time -84.72%. Yep. You saw that right.

I wonder if the bear flag had anything to do with it, though?

Hmmm.

\*\*TLDR: Google Trends says Nokia is a **massive** buy opportunity.

1/15/21 Nokia spikes on the Google Trends weekly chart at 10 PM. weird.

Even weirder, since I started updating this portion of this DD, Texas and Kentucky have joined the NokiTrain!

\-The Float Fallacy- Last but not least ;D

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

&#x200B;

Lastly, I would just like to address the echo chambered and (in MY opinion) incorrect opinion of how Nokia cannot move well or quickly in price because of what I will call ""The Float Fallacy.""

Nokia has a grand total of 5.6 billion shares that make up the company, otherwise known as ""The Float"". Nokia has a market cap currently of $22.1B.

That means when you multiply the total supply of tradable shares to how much money they each are trading for, you get the total overall valuation of a company.

The majority opinion everywhere on Nokia above all else, is that it cannot move due to its float size. Essentially, people are arguing that you'd need to buy substantially more shares

in order to move the price than you would a different company. While this is generally true, the AMOUNT OF MONEY TRADED STAYS THE SAME.

&#x200B;

To give you an idea of why the float doesn't matter, we can compare Nokia's market cap to the market cap sizes and share values of other competitors.

First example I will use is Ericsson. Ericsson has a market cap of $36.13B. Their share price is currently $11.76. Now, again, think about the MONEY, not the shares.

Say I wanted to invest $100 in a given stock. I could buy 8.5 shares in total of Ericsson. Or, I could get 24.5 shares of Nokia for THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY.

What sounds more appealing to you? Owning 8.5 shares in a company, or nearly 3 times as much?

&#x200B;

So let's compare market cap sizes with a few competitors to see just how much growth potential Nokia truly has.

We will just use the major companies listed alongside Nokia on the U.S. Federal 5G Cybersecurity Project.

&#x200B;

AT&T

Market cap: $207.87B

Share price: $29.17

Float: 7.13B

&#x200B;

Cisco

Market cap: $191.97B

Share price: $45.43

Float: 4.22B

&#x200B;

Dell

Market cap: $55.68B

Share price: $74.26

Float: 0.77B

&#x200B;

Intel

Market cap: $235.96B

Share price: $57.58

Float: 4.1B

&#x200B;

T-Mobile

Market cap: $157.98B

Share price: $127.28

Float: 1.24B

&#x200B;

These figures show the valuation that Nokia can and will eventually hit.

The only real negative effect of having 5.6 billion outstanding shares is that it can take a while for them to become more widely dispersed rather than overconcentrated.

Meaning a very select few absurdly rich people can and have been suppressing the price. The more they do it though, the more insane opportunities it gives you. That's the entire point.

So, in a way, float does matter, but that is EXACTLY WHY this is such a winning proposition. The more shares WE buy, the less THEY have and can control.

 

anddd, I'm done. Finally. This is my  very last update regarding Nokia until $0.20 is no longer a gigantic  movement.

Shoutout to John. I just wanna help people too. Seems like I'm apparently doing it wrong but idk.

What if gamma unwinds and we see a correction? A guide to the paperhanded included.,0.82,"So you know how the market has been edging up without a large retrace ever since the November lows? A lot of this has been linked to vaccine hopes and huge amount of cash looking for tendies. Crucially, it's also linked to huge volumes of call options being bought. If a dealer/market maker (MM) sells you calls, he wants to keep the tendies without taking any risk. So to hedge the risk of selling the calls and seeing the underlying rise, he needs to hedge his risk by buying the underlying (either stocks or index futures). The # of shares he needs to buy depends on the gamma - gamma is higher when the stock price moves closer to the strike price.

If call volume increase, dealer buying of the underlying stocks also increases, further lifting the stocks. This is basically what wsb used to be about before Melvin restricted rocket rides to shares only. 

**Much words, few points, you say.** Getting to it. So what happens if a factor that has been supporting the markets suddenly weakens or completely reverses? A bear move doesn't need a lot of sellers, it just needs a lack of buying at current levels, a small correction. Dealers unwinding their positions would add to the sales and we could see a fast plunge. Add to that the record amount margin loans and you have quite the laxative cocktail. This could be ugly as fuck.

I'm eyeing the area of 3244 - 3300 on $SPX as an area of ultimate support. A massive amount of stops are sitting below that area - it's a double bottom formed in September and November. A quick plunge below these levels would probably be short lived as it would most likely be stop hunting. I don't want to tie up too much of my capital on expensive SPY puts, so I'll be looking to get some IWM puts or maybe some gourd shorts. 

**Wait, but what about BB, GME, PLTR?** The above is based on the S&P500 and options flows. A short squeeze doesn't need permission from the index or Melvin. Individual stocks don't need to follow the index 1 to 1 if there are other supporting factors. In any case, I'd be looking to add to GME in case of any pullbacks (I'm holding 100 shares of GME $19.94 + 1/21/22 10c $BB). **The fact is, corrections are common and they happen when the least amount of people expect it (**judging by the downvotes posts like these get in the last week I'd say it started on Friday). **Do not 📜 👐 your position just because of a correction. It will pass but your regrets won't once the correction is over and you see your positions mooning. Be ready for it, anticipate it. Have a plan.**

Didn't add any crayon drawings, but you can check the put to call drawings in a lot of places.

This is probably going to get downvoted to hell, but what the hell.

Why MRO is the new GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,0.18,"OK degenerates, listen up. I've been doing some research on oil and I'm certain that MRO is STUPIDLY undervalued the same way Gamestop was back in August. Here's my DD:

First, MRO's market cap is $6.02 billion, but its net assets are $10.89 billion. This means that MRO should be trading AT LEAST at $14.93. This is why most analysts like Morningstar or raise its evaluation to $11 or $13, but I think they're being too conservative with its valuation. 

For one, MRO revenue in September increased 177% from the previous quarter while costs were about the same. The price of oil from March to June was about $30 while from June to Sept it stayed around $40. With just a $10 change in the price of oil, MRO was able to more than double its revenue. With oil prices nearing $50 now, it's very likely MRO will post a profit in Q4 2020.

Once they post a profit, MRO will return back to its true value of $10.89 billion meaning the price will SPIKE to $14.93. IMO the big funds have it WRONG because $11-$13 is undervaluing MRO. Their evaluations also rely on the assumption that MRO will lose money throughout 2021. 

Idiots will say that oil isn't as hot as renewables, which is true, but oil isn't gonna go away either. Between now and 2030, people still need oil to drive cars. Remember that gas powered cars are still 97.5% of all cars on the road right now. 

Furthermore, IF Tesla somehow pops, many electric car companies may pop as well and they might switch to gas car or oil companies. This can act as a hedge in the event Tesla pops. 

tl;dr MRO 🚀🌙

NIO Printing Tendies: Call of the Month,0.93,"Hello retards I'm new to reddit but have been trading for a few years now. Here's my analysis on NIO, any feedback is appreciated.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/11dq4g1ts5c61.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0eab8bb76eb57688a4cc5275da6ac8f2ae752cc

$NIO sold off toward the end of the week and is now sitting .3 CENTS ABOVE THE NEXT FIBONACCI RETRACEMENT LEVEL... PERFECT ENTRY POINT. Once we clear the next Fib trend level, near term prices could easily exceed $80+ and would further validate our trend line, which still appears bullish even after the selloff. Moral of my rant BTFD (BUY THE FUCKING DIP)

Great long opportunity especially considering a current RSI of sub 20 (way oversold) on no material changes in the company. We are still in a strong up-trend as can be viewed by the chart trend line and buying at an oversold level is an optimal entry point which is likely to continue given all technical factors.

There seems to be a common misconception that it's impossible to compete with Tesla. Think of Tesla like myspace. They were one of the first social media platforms with a successful business model, dominating the industry until Facebook had solutions for flaws in the system users didn't even realize existed. NIO isn't the next Facebook. But we're going to see something very similar unfold. The EV industry is still so young. Tesla basically created it's popularity and no one's had the chance to truly assess, adapt, and develop a business model that legitimately competes, until NIO.

Kick ass ET7 sedan they unveiled and next generation solid state batteries(providing 600+ miles of range on a single charge coming in the next year)

Battery as a service and battery swap stations are also taking off in China, this decrease upfront purchase price and longer range batteries makes $NIO eligible to continue receiving government subsidies unlike many competitors.

Tesla created the electric vehicle... NIO is reinventing the EV business.

I'm starting to think the Dummy from the Cohen tweet represents Jim Cramer himself....,0.96,"I think the Dummy from the Dumb and Dumber gif tweeted by Ryan Cohen represents Jim Cramer, and I think this because of a series of tweets.

I'f you look at Cohen's past tweets, there's a theme.

[Tweet #1](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1336775515101949963?s=20): Ryan Cohen tweets an article about Jim Cramer himself saying that GameStop will be the next Blockbuster. This tweet was from  Dec 9, 2020

[Tweet #2](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1344687817998401537?s=20):   Dec 31, 2020 Cohen tweets a quote from Benjamin Franklin:

>An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure

I take this to mean that Cohen aims to prevent bankruptcy, given his current focus.

[Tweet #3](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1346943412663177218?s=20): Cohen tweets a picture of blockbuster, accompanied by a shit emoji. Message is clear.

[Tweet #4](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1350877969816956934?s=20): Cohen's infamous  Dumb and Dumber tweet from last night. But what does it mean?!?! Who was the dummy? Well, let's take a look at Jim Cramers twitter.

[Tweet #5](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1351205382434250755?s=20): Today Cramer tweets to attack GME for not returning his calls, as well as misrepresents some details about a stock sale.

5 tweets, back to back ,in chronological order, all starting with Jim Cramer calling GME the next Blockbuster, and ending with Cramer complaining about Cohen ignoring his phone calls.

So, instead of answering of returning Jim Cramers calls, who is undoubtedly calling about GME bankruptcy/The Big Fucking Short Squeeze, Cohen tweeted the Dumb and Dumber gif to mock him.

Jim Carry in that gif represents Jim Cramer himself desperately clinging on a chance for bankruptcy, when Cohen believes there is not chance. That's my theory, at least.",2021-01-18 19:49:12

Are you a GMEtard that needs to re-up on your faith in Gamestop after the long weekend? Read my $36 --> $2.6k gains journey from (9) GME 1/15 Calls,0.96,"What’s up fuckers, so let me start this off by saying I’m probably one of the smaller fish in this retarded fish pool but I wanted to share my experience with GME this last week:

Last week I threw $36 on GME: (8) 1/15 $34c's and (1) 1/15 $30c; based off the news that there was an agreement with new investors. And holy fuck, Wednesday that blew up into $3k+; my account went from $700 to $4k with a peak of $9k. The wild part is I tried selling the (8) $34c’s for .03 the night before… 3 times. I ended up selling 7 of the $34c for $1,600 on 1/13 in 2 batches to re-invest into other options/stock. Decided to show GME some faith after reading about the shorters, bought 10 shares @$35 and decided to ride it out with my 2 remaining contracts since they expire Friday anyway.

I wasn’t used to this kind of money, and frankly I told myself I would take some out if I hit like over $5k, but of course being the retarded fish that I am, I held my positions through Friday resisting the urge to sell. Now unless I’m understanding this wrong, I wanted to do my best not to sell my ITM calls to some shorters (thinking they'll exercise it to buy back cheaper shares). SO I ended up selling ALL my call options (including the GME $34c as it spiked to $37) and ALL my stonks at 2:45 on Friday to be able to exercise MY FUCKIN RIGHT to buy 100 shares of GME at $30 before RH sells my contract for pennies at 3pm to some Melvin dude who’s trying to short GME. Hoping my $30c beats out their newly bought $34c in the greater push. I heard options don't affect the stock price as much but I thought it would be a great (and safe) way to buy into GME👊

Point being now… 100 shares into GME and 💎🙌 till we 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀!!!! Not really much compared to some, but now it’s 94% of my portfolio. They just turned me from a nobody into a degenerate soldier ready to stick it to the big guys and hold this app true to it’s name.

PS-

This is my first post since the mods won’t let new accounts post (at least in the comment section). Been watching this sub from a dark corner since Thanksgiving and finally had the balls to help and post about how AAXN was about to moon last week due to the armed protests but got blocked so quick because my account isn’t a month old (new to reddit in general). Not mad, just another part of the story😁 Today, technically yesterday, is the first day I can post according to the mod message so I’ll leave you with this:

WSB fuckin rocks!!! After being put through the ringer of the corporate world and pyramid schemes, I'm PUMPED I found a community to make some serious money with... and on our own accord. I have so much thanks to give to you guys so just wanted to share my 1,767% gains porn for the year and finally say ""Hello"". Hoping this gives inspiration to any GMEtard ready to ride this blast from the past all the way into the fuckin moon and blow up in a beautiful explosion of tendies 🚀🌑🤑

Indian Stocks $TTM $WIT $INFY,0.72,"While the GME gang and Tesla finish up posting their Gain porn from last week I wanted to talk about a boomer level DD.

I had started working on this post last week and never posted on it, but I still think Indian stocks had significant value moving forward. The Indian economy is growing 8% a year which is 2% greater than the US economy year over year. The entire infrastructure in Indian is still being built, so the country hasn't even really started its industrial revolution. This means its established companies have a lot of room to grow with an emerging market of 1BILLION people.

&#x200B;

$TTM was my safest bet, but it already started its climb thanks to Tesla. In the last two weeks alone $TTM climbed from 11.50 to 18. They are a car company that is moving into the EV landscape and will likely be Tesla's main competitor in India. The main advantage they have is existing relationships with the Indian state governments. Government contracts in India are extremely important because each state has its own cultural identity. They don't conform to the popular culture of Delhi and are actually more likely to give there business to a company like Tata Motors. This gives TTM a huge advantage since it has contracts in the southern Indian states (most recently Kerala). If companies like XPev and Nio have sustainable interest Tata Motors should be a clear favorite. 

&#x200B;

The company I am most interested in is Wipro ($WIT). This is an information technology company worth billions. They had been struggling for years before 2020, when they replaced their CEO with a much more aggressive executive office. Since then their growth as been apparent and they are taking a more revenue driven approach. Now why would this company trading at under $7 a share have value? Well 80% of this companies revenue is currently in North America and Europe. That means this Indian company has NOT even tapped its own market. That is about to change, starting in April Wipro is taking over the Indian locations of a German company Metro AG. This deal was worth 700million when signed, but does not actually take affect for a couple of months. That means the current 6.4 stock value will rocket in about 4 months. This takeover is the start of Wipro having regional monopolies in Indian, something that is not heavily legislated in their country. The stock has mid term growth protentional and June options for this company are currently really cheap. Its not an overnight gain like GME, but this one should pay off as the US economy may start to falter.  

&#x200B;

I am currently in on both of these and $INFY for shares and calls. As we get closer to April I will probably YOLO on Wipro options, so you can look out for that in a couple months.",2021-01-18 18:07:28

Been too long since we've had a bearpocalypse post 🐻 that should tell you something. 20k QQQ SPY put play,0.69,"This idea is largely built off of the work of a volatility trader I've been following on twitter. CK if you're reading this and want to be credited lmk, I'd link you but I don't want an army of idiots trolling you

Premise : the last 2 months has been a rocket fuel of market uppies thanks to the absurd amount of election hedging that happened for Nov election. [https://www.cboe.com/insights/post/57/](https://www.cboe.com/insights/post/57/) As those election hedges expire, they provide a ""Vanna"" flow, which is volatility decay in options pricing which in turn has market makers (the people selling you options) buying back stonks as they dynamically rehedge [https://spotgamma.com/options-vanna/](https://spotgamma.com/options-vanna/) (im gonna be honest I barely understand this concept). I'm sure a lot of you noticed how much the market spiked up Nov 4th even though the election wasn't close to resolved = that was an artifact of these election hedges expiring which in turn causes market makers to buy delta uppies in indices as they unwind from their hedges.

This last week was the first week where the last of the election vanna from these flows was cut in half, and what did we see? A mildly red week. Next week vanna flows will be gone, and there will be a two week window where the market will be without these flows since we're entering a 5 week opex cycle. No big deal right? People will buy the dip and what not?

Well, maybe. Right now it looks like everyone is positioned extremely long. Look at WSB, no one has made a bearpocalpyse post in forever. Call buying is literally at all time highs right now  

[https://twitter.com/sentimentrader/status/1350457253250396161?s=21](https://twitter.com/sentimentrader/status/1350457253250396161?s=21)

And it makes sense, this last year has created an army of people who have won massively in the bull market and they think they understand how the market works. Right now we're past all the main things people were worried about 1) election, one way or another, is done 2) covid vaccines are coming out, theoretically we should be back to life as we knew it somewhat soon 3) stimulus is coming, Mama Yellen gonna make it rain Buyden's gonna have ur back etc. == Everyone's bought in long right now. Which is fine but it means that there isn't much money left to buy at these levels nor to buy any dips that come

The big question no one knows is how much pain everyone can take on the downside before stop losses start getting hit from overleveraged longs, or before forced liquidation starts to happen. There \*could\* be a cascading liquidation event that starts slowly starts snowballing on itself.

There are some other important concepts here that frankly I just don't understand, something about this 5 week opex cycle meaning that the last week of the opex is actually gonna be bearish vix or something which means that we \*could\* end up in backwardation = iVol gets bid up in the next week of the 5 week opex cycle, which can/will further put downward pressure on stonks.

Also the rotation from tech - value taht is going to happen as Mama Yellen induces meaningful inflation (which hurts growth stonks but helps value like GME) could cut some of the tech rallies in the near term. What happens when you have a tech rally that's been gamma fueled and the 🚀 stalls? These things work down the same way they went up.

THE PLAY : I'm holding these puts thru the week, if by 1/22 we see a meaningful sell starting, I'm going to lean into it. If there is no meaningful sell by then, I will flip long again and cut out the short shit. \*Meaningful sell\* per the twitter source I follow is 1 standard deviation below the 20 day moving average. I have no idea what hte fuck that means so I'm just gonna use my guts and see if I""m feeling like staying 🐻 or not on Friday

Positions

GME is on it's own planet and if the market floor really falls out shorts are gonna get margin called and GME to the moon etc.",2021-01-18 17:19:25

Holy \*\*\*\* everyone! After my post on Friday explaining why that day's dip wasn't problematic a lot of things have happened. Once again, **thank to everyone for holding the line**!!! And also thanks to **everyone who keeps buying into the cause**. Stay put (aka don't press the f\*cking sell button)... Keep in mind, that not only are we likely to make big dollars but we are also protecting 45,000 people who work at a company that was important in many people's childhoods - and soon will be relevant for future generations again. Without further ado, here are the updates regarding GameStop:

&#x200B;

# 📅 A Summary of GameStop's moon mission

***GENERAL INFORMATION***:

* At this point we have many different investors that are in it for the long term (sorted by investment size): **Fidelity** (including their Intrinsic Opportunities Fund), Daddy Cohen's **RC Ventures**, **Blackrock**, **Susquehanna**, the OG u/DeepFuckingValue, and of course us *fellow retards* \- among others
* GameStop is still a Fortune 500 company which operates as the **WORLD'S LARGEST MULTICHANNEL VIDEO GAME RETAILER**
* The firm has huge potential for expansion (including in ecommerce) as the **video game market is valued at $160 billion dollars** with an estimated **Compound Annual Growth Rate of 12.9%** (according to *Grand View Research).*

***SHORT INFORMATION (Ortex Estimates; exact Updates not for another week)***:

* *Estimated short interest*: \~72 Million (decreased after spike but still up from 2020 EOY)
* *Estimated short float*: still at \~**101%+** (other estimates as high as 180%)
* GameStop is still on the **SEC threshold list for 28th consecutive days**
* Cost to borrow increased by an estimated 14.2%
* Around 80% to 85% of shorts were likely shorted with a stock price under $20  ❗ ❗

***NEWS***:

* Jim Cramer acknowledged that the short busting seems to be working
* Fidelity, IBKR and Schwab are confirmed to have eliminated/limit margin on $GME (heavily limiting short sellers)
* Outgoing board members sold a total of nearly $20 Million dollars in stock on Friday sending the stock tumbling bc of the news. Having that said,  💎 **✋ s** saved the stock from a potential panic selloff
* **Ryan Cohen Tweeted yesterday (1/17): Peanut Emoji & GIF saying ""So you're telling me there's a chance"".** The actual meaning remains unclear but many interpreted this as his confirmation that there is a chance for an infinity squeeze 🥜🥜🥜
* Multiple sources have confirmed that PC-Building Stations are coming in near future (mini microcenter-style)
* Uptick rule (SEC 210) is in effect until at least EOD Tuesday
* **$GS2C (Frankfurt) is up nearly 17% at the time** of writing this DD (on a NYSE holiday)
* Webull and Etoro disabled shorting $GME

***OTHER FACTORS***:

* There are talks about **potential margin calls** (which would strongly affect shorts)
* Additional stimulus potential will increase the WSB meme buy
* u/TitusSupremus DD post ended up on Reddit's popular page (with 300+ awards and 11k+ upvotes) making it inevitable for Reddit users outside of this sub to miss out on this. (This play has literally reached the Front Page of the ""Front Page of the Internet"")

**News about GameStop seem to be never-ending. This renders technical analysis nearly irrelevant as well. Despite some major publications releasing a bearish outlook on the firm, the bullish signs are overwhelming**

&#x200B;

# 🔮 Outlook over the coming days:

* Expect yet another highly **volatile day/week on the market**. Be careful with options at the moment; shares are likely the way to go and will also help the cause more...
* There is no doubt that the **potential for another squeeze exists** (maybe even a legendary MOASS)!!!
* Even if the squeeze does not happen (for whatever reasons) this stock is an **absolute value buy**, as many people before me have explained here. Another reason to go with shares rather than options!

**As long as idiots don't 📄✋ there is a fairly low potential for downside and HIGH POTENTIAL FOR LARGE UPSIDE on the LONG POSITION**

&#x200B;

# 🐻 Media Outlets, Melvin & other short sellers

I feel like I am a broken record, but GameStop is here to stay. I know WallStreetBets will never change your mind but if you were honest you would go back an analyze past short squeezes.

Let's take the example of KBIO's 10,000% squeeze:

* KBIO was entirely defunct and insolvent unlike **GME which actually has an amazing opportunity in a fast-growing space**. The childhood memories of most American's and brand recognition alone play a huge factor. Plus, their subsidiaries are solid as well!
* **Fundamentals don't matter in these situations**... it's a result of a variety of different factors that cause a short squeeze, and now you have an unprecedented influence: bullish individuals who will never give up - aka us!
* Most squeezes undergo a similar sequence of events:

1. Shares are **massively over-shorted** (over 100% is banned by some governments for a reason)
2. **Big news regarding the overhaul** of the firm (happened with RC ventures buying in and overhauling board control)
3. Forced **borrow recall** and/or margin removal (this already started)
4. An actual squeeze happens as **panic breaks out** among short sellers - it's just a matter of time before someone starts folding (BTW, doubling down on shorts in this case is a horrible bet and has barely ever gone well after a squeeze)

* News Outlets and analysts tend to focus on patterns or traditional methods of pricing stocks. There is no way to say that this will be a good stock to short and therefore short selling downside far outweighs the upside.

&#x200B;

**EASY TO SHORT does not mean EASY TO COVER. Now it's time to realize that SHORTING THIS STOCK WAS A HORRIBLE IDEA and in fact STILL IS A HORRIBLE IDEA. For institutional and retail short sellers alike: you may see the same consequences as $KBIO short sellers did - many of which went bankrupt. LONG POSITIONS are the way to go.**

&#x200B;

Note: For everyone who is new to this, please be aware that options have low impact on share prices and that volatility (among many other things) plays a huge factor in your trades. Be careful with your trades and always do your own due diligence. This is for educational purposes only.

PS: 🚀🚀🚀🚀

PPS: Now would be the perfect time for an announcement by GME for future plans. Even a small announcement relating to a technology-shift will slingshot-launch our moon mission. Maybe a potential for that happening as GameStop canceled appearance at ICR?? This is a big maybe, hence just a note as PPS...

&#x200B;

Positions: 190 shares (for the long run), 5 1/22 $38c (very risky and make up full reinvestment of my calls that printed last week) - will buy more shares tomorrow morning

# CAN'T STOP, WON'T STOP, GAMESTOP

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Over the weekend we have seen more bullish signs than anticipated. Even if we don't see a squeeze, we for sure have a value stock on our hands. $GME goes to the moon no matter what...

Edit: GME Mexico is up 24.4% as of 12:15 ET 🚀🚀🚀

Edit 2: Cramer just tweeted saying we are already on the moon. Keep in mind he was wrong about $GME before - and we showed him!!! And guess what... we will fucking do the same thing again

Edit 3: For the people who are tracking non-us GME: Mexico is up 40% and Frankfurt (aka Germany) is up 15.9% as of 1:15 ET 🥜🥜🥜

Edit 4: As of 4.45 PM, iBorrowDesk has reported a borrowing cost of 54.1% (a nearly 80% increase)",2021-01-18 16:00:04

GME Short Interest declined to 71M and some other explanations,0.96,"1. &#x200B;

GME short interest declined from 79.5M to 71M after Jan 15 EOD according to ORTEX estimates.

[Short Interest data left to the rightmost column(the reddit image was making trouble)](https://imgur.com/a/9D8GGO2)

[Chart of the same thing](https://imgur.com/a/cgthXrs)

Seems like the cost of borrowing has also declined very slightly for institutional investors(which is probably the more important factor as institutional investors can keep their margin requirements but the interest bleeds them).

2.

Probably the most important information, lots of ITM options had been cashed out on Friday, resulting in the ***unwinding of hedges*** by market makers. This would probably explain the price action of Friday the most; plus the profit taking by other investors. As a result, the stock sold by MMs and profit-takers were bought back by short sellers to cover their position.

**How does ORTEX get this Short Interest data?**

I have had an email exchange with ORTEX Co-founder and CTO and this is what he said, ""I have seen some question on Reddit regarding how we get the daily short interest data. And if you are interested I thought I should give you a bit of a longer explanation. The data comes from actual securities lenders, companies that facilitate the loans in stocks. They submit their lending portfolios, ie how many shares they have lent in any given stock, as well as how many stocks are available to be lent, on a daily basis. The data covers over 68 000 lending portfolios and includes over $10 trillion in availability with over $2 trillion worth of security loans per day. ""

How market makers consistently win selling weekly options - GME,0.95,"GME long share holder here and buying more next week as well :) I notice many on WSB are over buying OTM weekly calls and I want to explain why retail investors consistently lose on this.

1) As of last friday's close, a GME $36 1/22/21 call costs $460 while an April $40 call costs $900. Let's assume the next huge GME up move happens one random week between now and April 16th. It will cost on average about $2750 buying one weekly call option every week to hit a big win while it only costs $900 to buy one April call. Buying a weekly call after a volatility spike makes you a 3:1 under dog right off the bat. 

2) Institutions own a lot of gamestop shares and market makers can manipulate implied volatility and price in the short term as they please to protect their delta neutral options portfolio. It's common knowledge that robinhood poors rarely exercise OTM weekly options and market makers take full advantage of this.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cbruqv8tv0c61.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=2584c812d93e05f8457eff513ced85f216464d07

The first hour of open on GME on 1/13 the market maker's realized a surge of buyer's were entering and unusual buying volume was occurring (anyone have info on why btw? seemed kinda random to me). To adjust for this, they excessively increased implied volatility on the weekly options so the lagging FOMO buyers were paying a 3-4x+ premium for the same calls. Eventually implied volatility got so extended that people start selling. This allows the market maker selling the options to maintain delta neutral regardless of how many more people buy weekly options, because the next person to buy the call is paying a ridiculous premium compared to the previous buyers.

This being so, eventually the rate of theta decay will exceed the rate of incoming buyers, and the market maker wins.

TLDR: buy GME shares or April+ calls instead of weekly OTM calls!",2021-01-18 06:16:41

"$906.44 to $25,204.53 in two days. 1/12-1/14 $BBBY TO THE MOON!!🚀🚀🚀",0.88,"Good afternoon fellow autistics, 

Long story short recently quit my job, and cashed out my 401k. Decided to use all my 401k, and life savings to Yolo on some option plays. Fast forward 2 weeks, and I'm down from my $12,000 life savings to my last $900 bucks. 

I've been holding $BBBY prior to my failed trades, and the earnings had deceived me causing the stock to drop from 20s to 18s, and being the fellow autistic I am I had a margin call I had to cover so the shares were sold lol. 

After this loss (3k) decided to Yolo 5k on daily spy puts, and then the spy rallied causing my account to be near worthless, but with last $900 bucks to my name I decided to Yolo on Jan 15 - $23.00 strike calls @ .10 each when BBBY was trading at 19.00 on 1/12. Fast forward to 1/14 BBBY is trading at $25.00+. I sell my 85 options @ 1.53ish each turning $900 into $12,946.11. 

Then I continue to watch $BBBY accelerate towards $26.00, and decide to get back in. This time I get Jan 22 $26.00 strike calls for $BBBY. $BBBY then accelerates towards $27.00, and crushes through the $27.00 level. My $12,XXX initial position rolled into the $26.00 calls snow balled my account to $25,204.53. 

Fast forward to end of the day 1/14 I decide to use all the profits from $BBBY to buy May 21st $27.00 strike calls @ 5.55 each which I currently have 45 of. Bought them for 25k, and now they're sitting at about 19k USD. 

All in all - $BBBY has new management that came from target, accelerated share buy back program, 60%+ short interest, 77% increase year over year with digital sales, they are reducing their non-essential assets to increase cash flow to investments better suited to create more profitability AKA raising EPS aka raising the stock price. In addition there is also a low supply of housing, and increasing demand for housing. This will also increase the demand for stuff $BBBY sells. The upcoming earnings call scheduled for early April will begin to show early signs of a turnover. We are just a bit ahead of the results. 

LETS TAKE $BBBY TO 420.69

Important notes - $BBBY TO THE MOON NEXT 3 MONTHS $42.00+ TARGET PRICE, 60%+ SHORT INTEREST LETS MAKE THIS ROCKET SHIP LIKE GME BABY! 

BUY MAY CALL OPTIONS ANY PRICE $BBBY

Some Fundamental Numbers on GME,0.91,"Here is a summary of the Statement of Operations for you folks that like the fundamental stuff.

You can see why the stock price has dropped heading into 2019, quarterly results continued to deteriorate. Most recently SG&A have decreased which should help any additional sales go straight to the bottom line(profit). Analysts consensus Estimate for Q4 2020 is $2290 million. Holiday sales disappointed with $1770 million which puts meeting analysts expectations at risk unless console inventory can be replenished and sold before the end of January. If not, then more demand and sales gets pushed into Q1 2021 (Feb and onward).

With SG&A decreasing from the closure of less profitable stores and other cost cutting measures and with the boost in Net Sales expected for Q4 2020, SG&A-to-Gross Profit (bottom left chart) should fall back below 100% as it should.

Consensus analyst expectations is for EPS of +1.42 which would be the highest its ever been in the last 3 years. It will also be the first profitable quarter without Asset or Goodwill Impairments hampering profits. 

Edit: This means we'll have our 1st profitable quarter since Q1 2018 (not bankruptcy), once we have back-to-back profitable quarters, we will attract more mainstream investment firms. Watch out bears!  🚀

"PSA: Please stop using ""Market Orders"" and Instead Use ""Limit Orders""",0.94,"Obligatory: This is for education and entertainment purposes only, and not financial advice.

Okay, I first off want to say that I am stoked to see all the new degenerates that have decide to join this channel and dump their life savings into whatever one hot stock we are bursting at the seems with at the time. It's an absolute strength in numbers ""win"" for the sub, and it give me more hope for the momentum we build here. 

HOWEVER, I saw a lot of the new crayon casserole lovers, who've taken a break from watching their morning cartoons out there to dump your money into GME this week. Then coming on here and asking, ""I bought ""X number of shares at ""Y"" price, am I going to get rich now?"" 

As someone that has been doing this now for some ten plus years, this is a complete fucking rookie move! You want control over the situation, then use ""Limit Orders"" and assign the price at the proper support levels. You know who uses ""Limit Orders"" the bull with the 10 inch cock that comes over to fuck your wife every night while you sit in the corner chair and watch. Why you might ask? Because he's in control of the situation. He uses limit orders to buy the stock at a specific price instead of just sending the order to the markets makers to be assigned the highest price on the book for the day. So while you are buying that stock at $38.50, he's buying at a cool even $35.00, allowing him to capture 10% more on the upside. 

Perfect example is with GME, where the entire sub is screaming ""hold the line"" blah blah blah ""SPARTA"". You want to hold the line? Then place those future orders at support levels like 33 or 30. That way if and when the stock drops to these levels you get the price you want and you help the stock from dropping even further. So be fucking smart and be patient about this, this is your money so make it work for you and not against you.  

TLDR: Use limit orders if you really want to help control the underlying stock and make a smart investment. Be patient and wait for the price to come to you and so some fucking reasearch.",2021-01-18 02:17:59

All the catalyst were here, seemed like nothing can stop GME from becoming the Amazon for gaming, everything looked just fantastic for longs.

You woke up at 8am in you mother's boyfriend's basement, first thing you did was picking up your iPhone6 with cracked screen anxiously, opening your Robinhood app, clicking $GME, ""Holy shit"", you yelled out, you rubbed your eyes, it's real! It shows it's up 40% to $50 in pre-market.

You went on reddit, a bunch of posts were rejoicing with you, telling you the shorts can do nothing but give up at this stage, they had to cover their positions now, their doom's day is here.

The market opened, GME shoot up, crossing the $100 mark, then it's suspended for trading and when it opened again, it's $150!, then $200, $250, it kept getting suspended for super high volatility, but every time the suspending got lifted it went up another $50!!! Finally it crossed WSB's favourite number $420.69, but it still kept going, it's like a never-ending straight line going to the moon, no, Mars! Then the magic number $694.20 was getting closer and closer, you were thinking ""Haha funny number, I'll sell at that price"", you filled in order detail, Limit Sell 23 shares at $694.20, you were sweating balls, hoping your ma will love you now that you've made money in a stock. You submitted the order, it showed ""Sorry we've encountered an unexpected server error. Please try again later"".

I'm guessing the 1.5 tier stores will somehow reface themselves to indicate they are PC gaming oriented stores? Likely regional hubs I'd assume. They adopted a similar shipping and delivery model to Auto Zone and Advance Auto if I recall correctly. Sounds like a moon mission to me! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Legacy of WSB: GME short squeeze,0.96,"This post is unfortunately very verbose and many of you can’t real so apologies in advance. 

**Disclaimer**

This is not investment advice and only serves to provides commentary on of the financial markets and a mosaic theory on what is to come with respect to GME.  Should likely be flagged as NSFW as for many this will be a masturbatory aid for many until the markets open.

**Pre-amble**

I had an epiphany last night and the world just starting make sense. Instead of being overcome by a wave of relief and calmness, I was crushed by a feeling of dread and experienced one of my restless nights of my life. Respite only came by drowning out my thoughts with a bottle of bourbon. 

This first post outlines why GME will experience a short squeeze in the very short term. Dread is the pending dead of this community - undue blame will come from the media with WSB and retail traders in general to take the immediate brunt of the assault. With the additional media attention will come calls for regulation of financial derivatives and further assaults on the ‘gamification’ of investing. This post is just to set the foundation of the actual record on what is going to come.  

Those that are active in this community or have been lurking for the past couple years can attest to the increasing media attention that WSB has been receiving. This growth is now exponential with Jim Cramer basically leading a WSB public relations campaign and providing near daily commentary to his audience. There has been a material shift in dynamics in this subreddit over the past year. Many new faces of which quite frankly are financially illiterate. Please do your own research and understand how financial markets and derivates work – I have made this as friendly as possible but if you can’t grasp it get your wife’s boyfriend to simplify it for you.  

Many of you will not with in the financial markets and not yet grasp the scope of the WSB community as a whole, which is collectively its own hedge fund. The userbase is the working class looking to break out and live some kind of semblance of normal life, chasing the American dream, which is only getting further and further out of reach. We are little guys and accordingly rely on free brokerages like Robinhood, which results in our collective trade execution being complete garbage. Buying into a position results in thousands of users spamming the ask price on Robinhood and driving up market price. If we were a proper hedge fund, the aggregate positions would be acquired through algorithms co-located with the exchanges and other than potential volume spikes would only be actionable through review of regulatory filings.  

We also maintain like the largest research group in the country with thousands of users undergoing financial research and compiling DD on potential new plays. This research is compiled, disseminated, and reviewed, and actioned in real-time which is why attention is picking up. 

We are fundamentally disadvantaged hedge fund and to the dismay of the existing financial community we are actually winning. 

Cramer – giving the shifting demographics, I highly suggest you incorporate more rocket emoji’s into Mad Money or let us sponsor our own segment.   

**GME Short Squeeze**

**1. Why can insider purchases/sales move the market** 

Company insiders generally posses more knowledge of a company and when they buy it’s a signal the share price is undervalued and when the sell its overvalued. Capital is a scarce resource and directors of companies are human (or some kind of reptile, robot, human hybrids) and they need money to service their lifestyles. 

In WSB terms, if you are yolo’ing funds for a down payment on your house (or to buy a much nicer house with a lambo in the driveway) do you realize your gains when you hit your goal? This can be a prudent financial decision to satisfy a basic human need (shelter and Lambo’s) and isn’t always a signal that you think the real estate market and Lambo’s are better long-term investments than the stock market. 

Insider trades are a potential signal only.  

**2. What happened last week.** 

From 08Jan2021 close to 14Jan2021 close GME increased 126% from $17.69 to $39.91 (ignoring intraday highs) with the gains partially retreating on 15Jan2021 to $35.50 resulting in a 1-week gain of 101%.    

As per media, the pre-market 11Jan2021 SEC filing with Cohen assuming 3-board seats (Cohen and his 2 Chewy pals Alan Attal and Jim Grube) spurred and increase in retail demand and set off a short squeeze with the Friday declines due to the sale of 810,000 indirectly controlled shares by director James Wolf. 

Media is partially correct in that the Ryan Cohen filing resulting in a material increase in retail investment and drove up the share price, however it wasn’t a short squeeze. The combination of the increased demand and the precariously low float set off a gamma squeeze, which further exacerbating the upwards price movement. 

The James Wolf divestiture for any other company should have been relatively neutral news and should not have resulted in the Friday declines – these shares were indirectly owned shares by Hestia Capital Partners, LP with the sale to adhere to the maximum concentration guidelines for single stock investment of Hestia Capital. James Wolf and his wife personally own 50,689 shares (unchanged). James Wolf is on the board due to a proxy battle that goes back to 2019 and it is well covered on pages 13-15 of the 2020 Proxy Statement and is worth a quick read ([https://news.gamestop.com/node/17701/html#toc878410\_6](https://news.gamestop.com/node/17701/html#toc878410_6)). 

As a result, the Friday market reaction is very peculiar. If you manage a portfolio’s for others and the maximum single stock exposure that can be held is 10% for example with that stock increasing in value more than other positions, you need to reduce the exposure and rebalance to be within the investor policy statement thresholds otherwise it’s a breach of fiduciary duty. Majority of the disposal was on 12Jan2021 at share price of $19.99 with the remaining 11% (90,000 shares) sold on 13Jan2021 were at $31.08. The requirement to rebalance came before the price spike this week and James’s clients missed out on 50% one day gains.

Additional insider sales were noted on 15Jan2020 post market by the outgoing directors (not nominated for the 2021 Director Slate) as follows: Lizabeth Dunn (5,000 shares or 8.03% of holdings at $31.34), Raul Fernandez (34,619 shares or 51.36% of holdings at $35.27 average), Kathy Vrabeck (50,000 shares or 38.60% of holdings at $27.99). This represents an additional 89,619 in shares sold by outgoing directors and would be relatively normal given. This should cause an additional market decline on Tuesday absent any other information, however as above these trades should be relatively neutral signals and likely would have occurred with or without a price run up during the week.  

What is currently missing is additional filings for additional share acquisitions of Ryan Cohen, Alan Attal, and Jim Grube that will be forthcoming in the coming weeks and would displace the \~900,000 shares divested above. 

**3. What is a Gamma Squeeze**

This is going to be an oversimplification, as to understand a Gamma squeeze you need to understand the math behind option’s and the role of Market Makers (“MM”). I am going to keep things simple and only focus on the key points as this has already played out.   

**Delta**: measures the impact of change of the underlying asset. Hopefully you retards understand what a share is and if the share price goes up $1 the price of the share will also go up $1 and shares have a delta of 1. The delta on options will constantly change as the price changes (this is measured by Gamma below), however what is important is that far out of the money options have a delta closer to 0 and deep in the money options have a delta closer to 1 (or -1 if they are puts). Hypothetical example: a call option that as a current delta of 0.7 will go up $0.70 in price for a $1 increase in the share price, as the share price increased the delta will also increase to say 0.71 and then 0.72 and so on. 

**Gamma**: measures the rate of change of Delta. This measures how much the delta will increase with every increase in the share price and will be the highest when the options are at the money. 

**Market Makers**: the MM’s trade for their own account and make money based on bid-ask spreads (stock and options) and will look to be delta neutral. MM’s create most of the liquidity in the stock market.  

With that out of the way, what happened with the gamma squeeze?  Well, this is thanks to our friends at Melvin Capital Management LP (“Melvin”) who is well know and documented to death on this boards. As a special thanks to Melvin we should chip in with $100 when they set up their Go Fund Me account next week as none of this would be possible without their assistance. Cole’s notes are below.  

Melvin’s most recent filing dated 16Nov2020 disclosed a position of 54,000 put options and has been documented that the open interest was on 15Jan2021 24p.  ([https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F\_X01/infotable.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml))  

The Put options would have allowed Melvin to sell 5,400,000 shares (7.83% of total GME shares) at $24 to a 

MM. The MM would have hedged the delta on this position by selling shares short. As the puts went from ITM to ATM to OTM, the market make would have continued to manage a delta neutral position through buying the stock (covering shorts), buying back puts, or buying calls all which would have created positive price pressure.  

Cohen’s board appointments set everything in motion, share price started spiking, and to remain delta-neutral the MM’s exacerbated the upside price movements as above (due to the changes in delta). Positive price movements and FOMO on a short squeeze continued to drive up the price (especially with WSB buying deep OTM options and volatility spiking). This defines the price movements on 13Jan2021 the previous downward pressure of the MM short position was unwound. 

**4. Synthetic shares and Regulation SHO**

When you short a stock you borrow a share, sell it with the intent of buying in back at a later date for a cheaper price. When the Borrowed stock is sold, there is now a synthetic share that has been created and you think of this as a legal IOU.   

Naked shorting is illegal with an exception for the MM’s, which as noted above, is completed to remain a delta neutral position on the security. For all other players that are shorting, they need to locate and borrow the share before they can short it. When there is a purchase or sale and the underlying share certificate is not delivered it is reported as a failure to deliver. Regulations are in place on short sales and a quick summary is available on [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) 

Threshold Securities are equities that have aggregate fail for 5 days, and they pop up on this fun list ([https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)). GME has been on the Threshold security list since 08Dec2020 or 29 trading days. 

The relevant provisions for GME right now are the below: 

Rule 201 – Short Sale Price Test Circuit Breaker (or the alternative uptick rule). This was triggered on Friday due to the 10% price decline and will remain in place for Tuesday. At a high level, if the market crashes or continues to fall, this rule is in place to protect the long positions and allow them to exit before new short positions can be created. 

Rule 204 – Close-out Requirement. If a security is on the Threshold securities list for 13 consecutive settlement days, shares must be immediately purchased to close out failures to deliver. This rule is supposed to be in place to protect against naked short selling and market manipulation, however it isn’t really enforced and OSTK (Overstock.com) is a prime example as they made it all the way to 669-days ([https://investors.overstock.com/news-releases/news-release-details/overstock-reappears-regulation-sho-threshold-list](https://investors.overstock.com/news-releases/news-release-details/overstock-reappears-regulation-sho-threshold-list))   

What is enforced is unfortunately enforced is protection for the short sellers, the institutions and hedge funds that are the 1%, and when Overstock tried to push out a dividend which would spur a short squeeze, they didn’t like this (lawsuit was dismissed and reopened Jan2021). [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/overstock-founder-tried-to-squeeze-short-sellers-then-sold-out-when-the-sec-cracked-down-2019-09-19](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/overstock-founder-tried-to-squeeze-short-sellers-then-sold-out-when-the-sec-cracked-down-2019-09-19) 

There have been rallies on WSB to engage the media and some people have sent in formal complaints, however there is enough information to infer that markets might not be fair as they seem. As per the pre-amble, the collective community has always been fighting an uphill battle. 

**6. Ryan Cohen’s Twitter Profile**

For any of you following Ryan Cohen on twitter, his most recent post was today with a meme of Dumb and Dumber “so you’re telling me there’s a chance”

He is building a social media presence that previously didn’t exist and everything appears to be focused on aiding what was building up to be a proxy battle for GME. At this point the dude could tweet a video of himself having sex with a pig and I would buy more GME shares (direct reference to Black Mirror S1E1 – The National Anthem)   

The historical tweets have generally referenced more share purchases or material pending discloses (board seats), however the underlying is giving fair warning to the short holders to exit positions. Some of the previously deleted tweets are not back and he likely realized that once posted there was no taking them down. 

**7. Short Interest Position**

Short Interest is the number of shares sold short that have not been covered or closed out. Short Interest is formally published to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) twice a month and daily reports published 2 hours post market close ([http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html)) 

[Above chart courtesy of u\/StarSwitch post’ as I don’t have an OTEX account. Link to post: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/kx047v\/gme\_options\_update\_melvin\_put\_positions\_and\_volume\/  ](https://preview.redd.it/o6i5x4u0qyb61.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=43321f8ca4cf0c90b0e399c1bbf12f830e4b537b)

What is import on all of this is that the current short interest on the company is 79.52 million shares with only 69.75 million shares issued by GME. The 31Dec2020 short interest position was 67.98 million shares, so in 2021 the short positions have grown by 11.54 million shares and there was no actual covering last week. 

What we know is that if the price continues going up the shorts will at one point be forced to buy 80 million shares. 

**6. Volume Reconciliation and Price Volatility** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1l3xc375qyb61.png?width=2207&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e61fa16d0468900fb7f992198bf002bc6efe26d

The last 10 trading days (all of 2021) is depicted above. From 02Jan2021 to 12Jan2021, the average daily volume was 7.95 million shares with the respective volume from 13Jan2021 to 15Jan2021 being 114.50 million, 93.72 million, and 46.75 million shares. 

So, what the fuck is going on? Face appearance looks like volume has surged, and liquidity has increased (more buyers and sellers). 

So back in my pre-amble, I mentioned a fundamental disadvantage that WSB maintains on trade execution as the big players have trading algorithms on servers co-located with the exchanges. The massive increase in the short positions was used to defend a short squeeze, which by all rights should have been set off on 13Jan2021 absent this unfair advantage.  

The cost of the shorts defending their position was opening an additional 11.54 million short positions the long security holders gobbling up these securities. Why would they do this? Well, it’s their last stand, the magnitude of potential losses in a short squeeze would result in many of the short holders being liquidated and if they started covering their shares throughout the week the volume would have disappeared and the stock price would have been going up dollars each tick. 

In section 2, I noted that the price action on 15Jan2021 was peculiar as the news was neutral. Well, this is our friends is volatility at play, any news (or a tweet from Ryan Cohen like his Dumb or Dumber tweet today) will result in material swings in the stock price as there isn’t any float remaining – the same shares being traded back and forth hundreds of times a day with additional long positions resulting in the 14Jan2021 and 15Jan2021 volume declines. 

For those like Crayons, I am not a fan of technical analysis; however, the last 3 days looks awfully like a bull flag in the above chart, when you considered the price suppression on 13Jan2021.  

**7. What will come**

As many are aware, many brokerages started increasing the margin rates on GME to 100% - Brokerages are afraid of their exposure and don’t want to get caught. 

Cohen lit the final fuse with his tweet today and we are going to lift off next week.

The short interest being over 100% is unprecedented and this should by all rights be the most aggressive short squeeze ever witnessed in the financial markets. 

I started writing this post yesterday as I was hoping to be able to reconcile a price target for exit. There are a ton of factors at play, however I truly believe now that some of the original posts about this being an infinity squeeze are correct. The $100 million shelf offering, will not be sufficient, and GME will need to announce an additional offering to provide the necessary liquidity for this to fully unwind.

My personal exit strategy: 10% of holding at $1,000, with an additional 10% to be sold every $1,000 price increment.",2021-01-17 21:47:06
How I’m playing GME <-> NVAX,0.92,"If your like me, you’ve been patiently waiting for NVAX news, only to miss the TSLA run and the GME pop last week. 

Here’s how I’m trying to catch the the GME squeeze and roll all those tendies into NVAX or vice versa. 

By my reckoning we have about a week before NVAX South African PH-II. In preparation I have half my account in 02/19 130c options. 

Hopefully GME will squeeze hard Tuesday. I currently have the other half of my portfolio in 02/19 40c options. 

Alternately GME might be flat and NVAX may hit.  Whichever comes first I’m going to chain these two events together. If NVAX pops I’ll roll profits into shares. If GME, I’ll accumulate more options in NVAX. 

On Tuesday another 4k will clear and I will throw all that into GME shares to do my part to force the squeeze.",2021-01-17 21:36:50

LOW rocket ship is now re-fuelled - launch to $200 is imminent,0.73,"So listen before I get started, I get it - this is not TSLA or GME or PLTR  which are some of my favorites, but somehow our fellow autists have missed the ongoing run up of LOW. I believe there is still time to get into this trade and make some serious tendies on both cheap ass calls and stock into earnings and even past.

IT HAS BEEN UP EVERY SINGLE DAY THIS YEAR - WHY ?  STONKS ONLY GO UP.

1) Lowes announced a massive stock buy back of $15 billion dollars last month. Lowes is going to the market and buying almost 20% of all outstanding shares, that's how much money they have, think about that for a second. They don't buy back stock to lose money, they buy back to make their shareholders money by increasing the share price. 

2) Stimmy - the first round of stimmy benefited home retailer companies like LOW and HD in a massive way. Papa Joe is sending another $1400 and like it or not, many to people who don't need the money and will be going and spending on their homes with this. 

3) Interest Rates - starting to creep up and many people are rushing to refinancing their pads and renovating with extra cash, they will be going to HD and LOW for alot of this.

Here's the current chart of LOW  - as you can see it has been rocketing forward even when the market has been experiencing a bit of red this week. This is a play into earnings and maybe longer if they crush it in Q4.

BULL MARKET IS HERE AND BACK UP NEXT WEEK LETS GOOOOOOo.

Fucking Alibaba. This is an absolute juggernaut of a company that is currently plagued by every piece of FUD possible. Chinese government whipped out the cock & a centimeter ruler. Ant Group IPO hamstrung. Impending regulation. Jack Ma in hiding for fear of having his mouth cauterized shut. Down 30% from ATH. WSB mocking call holders who caught the falling knife. This kind of dark cloud overhang is exactly what I look for in my trades. There are always big gain opportunities, but comeback stories often have a lower floor than other highflying momentum opportunities (GME, EVs, SPACs).

&#x200B;

**\*\*\*\*\*CATALYSTS AND OPPORTUNITIES\*\*\*\*\***

&#x200B;

**RELATIVE VALUATION:**

First and foremost, this is a great company. This isn't some kind of ""I'm the smartest idiot in town"" play where you try and make a buck off of something worthless. This is a truly undervalued equity. Chinese stocks have been super hot lately. Mega hot. This isn't necessarily bubbly. China is arguably the strongest market in the world and the emerging middle class over there will fuel rocket-like growth for years to come. Look up Dalio's thoughts on China if you need to be convinced. Stocks like JD, PDD, BILI, BIDU, NIO, have all seen unbelievable rises. Money managers are foaming at the mouth looking for Chinese exposure. I don't blame them. However, after these astronomical rises, money managers will start rebalancing positions and looking for new opportunities. Cue Alibaba. This one has herpes currently. It won't have herpes forever. There's a black swan risk for Alibaba. It won't happen. As gains get trimmed in other Chinese stocks money will flow to BABA undoubtedly. The valuation is too sexy. It's been underperforming for reasons that have absolutely fucking nothing to do with fundamentals.

**UM AKSHYUALLY IT'S A VIE YOU DON'T OWN THE STOCK**

Shut the fuck up. People talk about the ownership structure like it's a latent scam to defraud American's of 100s of billions of dollars. This will not happen. China needs access to US capital markets. This would singlehandedly destroy that relationship and hamstring China. Yes, China is the manufacturing capitol of the world. Yes, the USA is the financial capital of the world. We are mutually dependent. If this falls through, we all have way bigger problems than your $2000 call position. Market is fucked period if USA & China go nuclear in the financial markets. Nothing functions without Chinese sourcing.

**INVEST WITH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT**

CCP has a ownership interest in Alibaba. The CCP also came out and said that they want ownership stake in Ant as well. It's so transparent. CCP is pushing down Alibaba's value, seizing more ownership, then going to let it fly with favorable outcomes to the FUD that they created themselves. Do you really think China is going to kill something that is seen as the golden goose of Chinese ingenuity and progress? China wants to become an economic superpower at all costs. I don't care if the put Jack Ma in prison for life. This thing will continue to grow. Baba is bigger than Jack Ma.

**HOLY FUCK LOOK AT THE FUNDAMENTALS** ***( skip if you're afraid of numbers )***

30% YoY revenue growth. 60% YoY growth in AWS copycat. 900 million MAUs. FCF up 33% YoY to $6 Billion US. Increased share buyback.

And the margins. Look at the fucking margins. 29% net profit margin for FY 2019. With 30% Revenue growth. AMZN's net margin is 4%. This thing is an EPS powerhouse that will continue to see ***bonerworthy*** FCF and boost buybacks. In my opinion, this is literally the cheapest listed stock in the world. Held down by FUD.

**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*FINALLY- WHAT MAKES THIS MOON?\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

**#1- Jan 20-** Joe Biden takes office. He wants to show all his friends how much cooler he is than Donald Trump, so he gets a patty-cake deal done with China. Fears about delisting subside. Institutional money gets braver. Black swan risk becomes more muted. I expect positive China relationship commentary to come out within a month of him getting sworn in. His administration will be much less hostile and unpredictable. Great for BABA & US/China relations.

**#2- Feb 11-** Earnings. Earnings will be stellar as always. China handled Covid way better than we did and its economy has been chugging ahead at full stream. The great numbers will remind everyone how fucking cheap this thing is. Expect a pop if it hasn't already ran up a shit ton beforehand.

**#3- Date unknown-** Resolution gets announced between CCP and Alibaba. It will not be as bad as everyone expects. This is literally a dog and pony show to show everyone how cool and strong the government is. Once that uncertainty gets removed, this thing flies. Same goes for Ma reappearance. When that dude comes back with his 1000 yard stare and says everything is cool, expect an instant pop in share price. There is literally every bad piece of news baked into this. This is where you want to be going long.

**How do I play it?**

Shares are fine. I was long BABA shares, sold them to buy LEAPs because the pricing was so good. 40% IV not bad for the actual volatility I expect. I wouldn't buy calls expiring before the summer. Time is your friend here because of the situation and waiting on clouds. It has been trading in a tight range from 220-245, If it dips back to 220 I'm adding summer expiry 270 strike calls to my position which I will unload when it breaks out, letting my LEAPs ride.

When this thing shakes off the bad press it will fly. I can see $400 before EOY, at which price it'll still be cheaper than its peers.

**Positions: 2x 300C LEAPs expiring Jan 20, 2023, cost basis $6500, current value $8200**   🚀🚀🚀

The $BB DD you need to C 🚀🚀,0.94,"What comes to mind when you think of BlackBerry? Phones? Your a chump if you answered phones.

TLDR up front, BlackBerry has pivoted away from making phones and instead is in the software sector. Some big names that they have include,  [SpaceX](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=0&article=1737&context=smallsat&type=additional), **Nvidia**, **NIO**, **Xpeng**, **Ford** and 19 out of the 25 EV companies now use QNX.

**Software**

BlackBerry has gone away from the phones business and has reinvented itself to become the main player in Automobile OS systems. They have lock and key in this market since many OEMs don't want to start from the ground up making the software themselves. As of June,2020 they have the QNS software in over[175 million cars](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-175-million-vehicles-301081594.html). Nvidia uses BlackBerries QNX for the base of its [self-driving car](https://channeldailynews.com/news/nvidia-to-build-its-ai-self-driving-platform-on-blackberry-qnx/58048). Sony is also partners with Nvidia and BlackBerry for the car they are [making.](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-reveals-more-details-on-its-secretive-vision-s-sedan/) Not to mention the companies that use QNX are subscription based, so reoccurring revenue. This is speculation on this part but Hyundai is using QNX and has partnered with Apple, and carplay is a layer built on QNX.

**Fundamentals**

BlackBerry recently just sold all of there phone [patents](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-blackberry-sells-90-patents-to-huawei-covering-key-smartphone/) to Huawai showing that they are no longer in the phone sector. Big Boys have been adding more BB to there pockets and the last 13F was on the 15th (1/15/21) (Fin---tel)

[https://gyazo.com/d9894e59a75885c1506dd3a2ef576ebe](https://gyazo.com/d9894e59a75885c1506dd3a2ef576ebe) I had pictures to show it but the braindead bot removed it.

Other big short inst---itutions have a hard on for keeping this low, BB was in the top 20 most shorted stocks but GME was number 1. Just this Friday(1/15) Shorts and inst---itutions sold alot.

The **50 dayMA crossed the 200dayMA** in December and has held since then. Also check out that 188million green.

Morningstar and CFRA both put $BB with a fair value price of 6.40, so you can assume that is the absolute bottom. (copied from [u/ThegreatLoudini](https://www.reddit.com/u/ThegreatLoudini/))

They also have **more cash** **than Debt**.

However, I have been long GME since 6$ thanks to Jeffamazon's amazing DD a while back. However, if you have been in it since then, you would remember how GME always:

1. Reaches new all time high's 
2. Immediately tanks back down (always remains higher then where it first mooned)
3. Consolidates for a week or two.
4. Moons again to an even greater ATH.

Point is, I see way too much expectation building for next week where I'm fairly certain its going to tank back down into the lower 30's based purely on how it has behaved before, and I worry that all this positive bias will be detrimental when it makes people paperhand. Just keep in mind all the fantastic DD that has been posted before and hold strong through the dip. That being said, it would be fantastic if it squeezed next week, but I'm not counting on it.

TLDR: GME will squeeze for sure, but I doubt it's happening as soon as this week. Don't paperhand your shares like a bitch if it dips. For the extra autistic:

"Before I leave, I'd like to say one last thing...",0.93,"I  want to start this off by saying you guys are my heroes. I fully  support everything you do, as long as you don't paper hand GME. Keep  making memes and tendies and memes about tendies forever. But it's  important to acknowledge this isn't for everyone. So lay off the guys at  [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) and [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/).  They're just putting away money they make into something with better  than banks, which thanks you for letting them make billions of dollars  with your money by giving you 0.001% of what they make with it. They're  doing fine for themselves and sometimes I wish I was more like them.I'd  like to state for the record that I was once one of you. Up 300% in  September off of TQQQ weeklies. It was fucking great. I actually got  back the 90% I lost on the Great Pump and Dump of 2017 (can't say which one, cause of the 1B rule, but it rhymes with Shmelios and Shmatheson) and then  some! I was going to be one of the few who turn 2k into 2M in a year, I  just knew it. I was picking out yachts already and I was *finally*  going to live my dream of starting a business. Had to do more research,  keep checking WSB and the financial sheets, have to find the next big  play.  Which was GME of course. I doubled that again right as it popped  up to $22 in December, up 600% this year. Almost had my first 10k, it  just had to hit $25. Had to always check watch it, cause if you miss a  big move, you could miss out.  So of course, my 25c'sexpired worthless.  Down 50% now.

This is where it  hooks you. You know you're right, you just have to give it one more go.  But you have to check your phone right now in case you miss the big  event. One last try, more money, you'll make it big. I bought 1/22  $20c's right before the ICR conference, it literally couldn't go tits  up. Just had to keep watching to see if what they say is good or bad.  Had to watch the stock too, to see how people react. Had to watch after  hours, cause someone might place a big order at 11:30 at night when you  can't sleep cause you're thinking about GME. 

But  they never did. They never presented. Down 75%. Maybe it was too good  to be true and the Tendie McTendface would never be mine. Didn't work  all day to watch the market until 3:50pm on Tuesday, decided I was done.  Can't do it anymore, my stomach hurts and I hate this, I'm out. 10:00am  Wednesday, would have had all my debts paid off and at least a small  canoe with the 35K that those options were worth. Now the dread and the  FOMO and the self loathing kick in. I'm just now pulling myself up  enough to say that I really truly am out.

I  know I missed out big, but there's always another GME. I know it's not too late to get int. There's always people making money and people losing money. I could have bought Tesla at $30 or the electronic currency that shall not be named in 2011. And maybe  some day when I have a real job and less credit card debt I'll come back  and blow stacks on ARKG calls, who knows?  But not this time. This isn't for  everybody. You can always make money, but you can't make sanity or time.  I know a lot of people on reddit are prone to anxiety and depression  and nothing triggers dangerous behavior like giving an depressed and  broke young guy the opportunity to solve all his problems by putting his  financial security, or lack thereof, in the hands of a largely  unpredictable market entirely outside his control. This shit gets  addicting real easily, and I applaud those who can handle it and make it  out on top, but just remember it's not for everyone. I saw a post where  someone was asking for help about trading addiction and got laughed out  for being a paper handed bitch. Don't be that guy. 

Please  just remember, this isn't supposed to take over your life. Yes, you can  make $100k a year if you're really good and all you have to do is click  some buttons and wait. Most people I know, if offered a job that paid  $100k and ""all they had to do"" was constantly be agitaed and anxious and  stare at numbers on a screen hoping you didn't make another stupid  decision you stupid idiot I hate you you're always wrong and you're  going to drive everyone away because of it... You get the point. I  wouldn't take that job no matter how much you paid me.So be nice to the  guys over at [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) and [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/),  they're just trying to do good for themselves. And remember you can  turn your phone settings ""invert colors"" and hold it upside down if you  want a green line going up.

I still don't understand [r/dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/) though. Are those guys serious? Is that like a real thing? You made 15 cents this week? Great, get a job... idiots.

(GME DD) One DD to rule them. One DD to find them. One DD to to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.,0.87,"# Ok retards listen up. Been seeing lots of cucks writing small DD pieces of bullish or bearish shit. You cucks need to read this cos this is the whole fucking thing.

this is also basically my magnum fucking opus so upvote retards. Dont give me awards, legit go buy a powerup membership for a year. Cant tell you to buy shares because we gonna get closed down by Suck Elons Cock somehow.

im also not some fininacial advisor or whatever just read this and make your own conclusions degenerates. Im not fucking liable lmao but i am balls deep 125 shares @ 19 average now, its literally all I have on this earth.

TLDR: GME DD sumarized, Margin doesnt affect longs the same way as shorts right now. Dont buy shares on margin though and get ready to supply collateral regardless. Short interest is up and some smart retards are on our side. Read the post to raise your IQ from 8 to 9 though. **🐻 🌈s  mega fuk and even posting high level bear shit to scare us.**

Compulsory 7 rockets so you autists dont start having a seizure or something:

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Basically been seeing posts about ""blah blah margin this, short interest this, WS to clever blah"". Going to split this post into distinct sections but im no english degree cuck so dont expect any bear bloomberg  level shit or something

# 1. GME is a fucking steal regardless of squeeze. Buy now or be left on a dying planet while we head to alpha fucking centauri.

So basically everyone here knows about Ryan cohen and his horsemen of the apocalypse coming to steal melvins lunch money. This man bought apple stock in 2017. Hes fucking rich. Hes also an eccommerce wizard, taking CHEWY from a measly 100k co-founded company to a $4 Billion company in 2017 at which point he sold it to petsmart or something. Its now valued at $40 Billion, granted anything eccommerce now gets money thrown at it like a stripper in a high flying strip club or some shit idk im a virgin so dont listen to me, so it may well be a bubble. Regardless the thing grows its revenue like bacteria doing binary fission on agar jelly 🚀🚀🚀🚀.

THEY SELL FUCKING PET FOOD. the market for that is like what? $1?. Gaming is going to the moon and is basically recession proof because of how cheap game is compared to other things for how much you get out of it. Any bears saying that Gamestop cant compete with digital or with amazon. Ryan cohen already slapped amazons head in with a no name brand. Hell fucking do it again. About digital everyone here already knows, microsoft deal, Ryan cohen also mentioned the possibility of having ""Digital game exchanging"" or something, image below.

[Online trade ins. It says online.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/2ba9j5d2zvb61.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b6f3f26c3588fdb8cc779aee8a3b1ce42859f33)

He also mentions streaming, digital content etc and aside from all the digital stuff wants GME to move to a community centric structure where big stores operate with VR centres, Internet cafe, table games like Dungeons and dragons and  40k (rapidly growing somehow will boom post covid) and as we now might know due to this post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme\_dd\_buildapc\_kiosks\_coming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/)

BUILD YOUR OWN PC KIOSKS. This is the literal smell of money. Go to your Gamestop to build your PC with your kid? Gamestop is already the goto place wher your parents go to get you your latest digital fix so now they can go build PC's and it cant go tits up?

**Now for some pussy boomer talk (aka fundametals or something).**

The expected Q3 EPS was -0.84$ or something close to that. The actual loss was -0.53$ but boomzoids only talked about the revenue drop. No shit sherlock its closing all its dead weight stores.

In the holiday report I will talk about a bit more below, 11% of stores were closed and revenue dropped only 3%. Comparitive store sales increased nearly 5%. They cant get enough consoles to sell so expect the momentum to carry on for the whole year I expect. Eccommerce is up 300% over holidays. In Q3 they reported 800% to date. In 2020 Gamestops eccomerce went up 24x. YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT. Online sales now account for \~33% of Gamestops sales now. This is literally gold dust for ryan cohen.

We are still trading at 0.38 P/S at this price. The average P/S for the SP500 is 2.753. Massive upside on these two numbers alone.

Burry got in this for the MOASS and the intrinsic value. At the time intrinsic value was like $22 and this will pump up as RC takes it to new heights.

GME in Q3 somehow halved the expected loss. Big Bad Boomer sherman somehow didnt fuck it up that bad by saying ""omnichannel"" at the speed of light. Yes the revenue dropped 30% but thats covid for you. As the PC kiosk post above shows GME now sells small items basically so fast they have to have fake stock lmao. The new console cycle always spikes the share price sky high too, as youll see in a crayon drawing later. The potential revenue that this console cycle brings in could be huge. Biggest ever is potentially a true statement and Gamestop sells every fucker they get. Combine the fact that they share game pass ( a massive hit) revenue from the xboxes they sell, something no other retailer has, revenue could be sky high.

Now I know you autists are starting to develop short term dyslexia or something but keep reading. This could be the most important piece of shit you read in your life. How do you think I feel? My brains overheating just trying to write coherent sentences.

Holdiay report was a bear trap imo, saw people saying the decrease in revenue was bearish blah blah blah. Lies. Comparitve store sales rose 5% and thats with some towns having like 4 gamestops. When the leases dont get renewed and these stores get liquidated (Also in Ryan cohens letter) they can just get this influx of cash and pay down debt and invest in logistics and marketing and new growth. Gamestop realistically needs like 1/2 the stores they have now and just need to improve efficiency.

[https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890) this article the messiah himself wrote. In it he states:

>At Chewy, we had maniacal discipline when it came to how we spent money. The company-wide culture of frugality came from his example. Free cash flow was our unwavering governor of growth. We grew Chewy from $200 million in sales in 2013 to $3.5 billion in 2018 while spending only $130 million in capital, all of which went into opening distribution centers across the country and acquiring new customers.

Maniacal. Thats all I need to say. The guy is going to get to mars before papa musk and he wont even break a sweat. When FCF starts to catch up to WS expectations every cuck analyst who donwgraded them is gonna get ditched and upgrades will start to happen.

So in the headin i said its a steal. That implies some future higher price target right? Well here is my guess for a conservative price target based on the information above and also some more I probably forgot cos im a retard.

[The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares \(another reason shorts are fuk\)](https://preview.redd.it/dehiug393wb61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=f198773c36d5109382eb2beba6fade3c059121df)

>The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares (another reason shorts are fuk)

This alone means if for not inflation adjusted terms we reached 9.8Bn or whatever the crayon chart says we should reach:

9.8/2.48 = \~3.95   3.95 \* $35.5 = \~$140. The share price now to reach old mkt cap is $140 fucking dollars. Thats a 4 bagger from now. It gets better.

from [statista](https://statista.com) :

>Considering the **annual inflation rate in the United States** in recent years, a 2.24 percent **inflation rate** is a very moderate projection.

If we take 2.24% inflation, the this share price target in todays money means we should reach $182 because of $140 \* 1.0224\^12, = $182 in adjusted. Thats more than a 5 bagger. basically we could see $10 GME price from short manipulation and buying more is basically a lottery ticket!

I really dont understand the bear thesis. The only bear thesis ( short term this one) was that margin would affect longs more but I looked at it on ortex and its basically bullshit. Buy shares with cash though dont use margin. Own your piece of GME dont borrow it. Bears just spout ""DigITaL"" or ""BlOCKbuSTER"" so much Ryan tweeted a shit emoji at them. All the bears think theyre clever. What the fuck makes those cucks special? How are they different now than the ones from $2, or $4, or $10.

**Bears are betting against:**

Ryan fucking cohen, buisness legend CHEWY from 100k investment, now 40 billion

Michael burry, Investing legend, predicted the housing crisis and is in GME since april

u/DeepFuckingValue , the new WSB god chad, now basically a whale

Reggie Fils-Aimé, gaming and buisness legend, former COO of nintendo

Senvest, a mega fund thats actively managed

Norweigan sovereign wealth fund

Fidelity, Vanguard and blackrock own this shit and are never selling they literally dont give a shit

All of WSB has now formed a shield wall against the bears

Microsoft gave GME highly discounted azure deals and free office use for all employees and a revenue sharing agreement. Bears are stupid if they think MSFT didnt vet GME.

&#x200B;

Some valid bear thesis left now (the only ones left) ----> Ryan Cohen dies.

# 2. Now some analysis on the short squeeze and some technical data on puts and calls and ortex data.

Ok everyone on here and their cat, dog, bedbugs and wifes boyfriend  knows about the squeeze. Jimmy chill aka cramer even talking about it. Gamestop is literally the most shorted stock of all time and space. The squeeze makes every autist salivate because its basically free money while cucking big money out of like what 1% of their fund.

Although I know all you cucks hate shares, and hate holding, if the squeeze doesnt happen selling is probably the most retarded thing anyone could do. Its literally buy high sell low and you fucking disgust me. STONK ONLY GOES UP.

This squeeze is so monumental that its been sucking sharks in like fresh blood. Most of the funds where shorting this from 30-15 dollars before this year so they didnt really care. It all changed with 2 people. u/DeepFuckingValue and Dr. Michael Burry. These guys are as OG as it gets with GME. I think u/DeepFuckingValue may have even sniffed this trade out before the legend himself. Since then funds will have churned this through their rules and started jumping on this train. Ive been in since $13 with 125 shares. If I had more money Id be buying but im just some stupid student ok. Im merely a medium for this money made information.

**The stats for this stock now short wise are, from ortex:**

*Concrete* short interest as of 31 December 2020: **71 Million**.

*Estimated* short interest, *January 11th data:* (This isnt predicted, this is from data in flow, has margin of error) : **77 Million**

Short shares on loan 7 days ago: **50 Million**

Short shares on loan *now* (This breaks the bearish margin calls affect longs more thesis): 54.2 Million

% of known float short: **147%** as of 31 December 2020

% of know free float on loaned shorts: **108%** as of January 11th.

Some [guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyocql/updated_potential_holdings_of_gme/) on here took into account extra buying on wednesday, Institutions, Burry, RC's extra 7% and WSB ownership (something so stupendously  retarded no serious firm will do it) that float on short could be in the 100s of %. Total short float now I would say could be **200-400%** if the numbers are correct.  This pisses on all other short squeezes. Some countries ban shorting above 100% cos of how autistic it is.

The recent hike in interactive brokers available shares is probably a mix of sell off on friday (remember  some guys are now buying lambos with GME money. If they held they could buy 10), calls exercising and puts being covered and brokers ditching the shares. Nakedshort even reported 5 million naked GME shorts on friday. This is bullish as fuck because the best the shorts could do on a red market day was **-10%**.

Gamestop is still on the SECs threshold list for 27 days now.

[This shows naked short selling and downwards pressure hasnt capitulated](https://preview.redd.it/xsetax08pwb61.jpg?width=1083&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=172439b81f509ba01ed3e6489671d6f009298e84)

Need rockets 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀:

Ok so now if WSB owns an estimated 6-8% of the stock and we all know to move over to cash accounts now to avoid margin calls, we should be minimizing longs getting margin called. Every bear on stockwits is a clueless cuck who spouts ""blockbuster"" and these guys dont even know what margin even is so my bet is the colossal **54 Million** shares short on loan are gonna be affected by the margin calls more. Why? Because every long on margin is in the green, and now a true zealot/extremist/autist for ryan cohen so will supply their account with collateral to avoid margin call. Shorts are in the massive red zone. How do I know you ask?

Ortex data from Jan 4th 2021:

[This is the data from ortex for short interest for Gamestop for Jan 4th](https://preview.redd.it/urqb3c3zbwb61.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=d874cd908bad7fe3e8aa4486b5a294f5c1d5724e)

So this shows for jan 4th the estimated short interest is 66.98 Million shares. From the exchange reported 71 Million on december 31st this makes a lot of sense because the share price fell from \~21 to \~17 so shorts took profits. The shares on loan arent for longs too. This is all purely short data, and 47M  shorted at $17 this shows.

These shorts are in a circle of hell we cant comprehend and makes satan scared.

SHARES ON LOAN HAVE GONE UP.  BUT 87% OF LOANED SHORTS WHERE SHORTING AT SUB $20.

Cost to borrow is also up, estimated short interest is up to a cataclysmic amount.

Longs on margin need to supply collateral, but we are in the massive green zone, shorts are underwater. Margin calls will ravage the shorts and sting the longs. We also have the uptick rule in place until the end of the day, so shorts can only short on the way up.

**Seen a lot of talk about Gamma hedging and delta.**

You realize that the fucking bankers and brokers dont understand gamma hedging right? That shits up their with the black-scholes equation and feynman-kac solution. Forget about it. The retards claiming to understand it are either payed by hedge funds or lose money. The guy who took out outs thinking options exercising and gamma hedging would lead to a collossal sell off on friday lost money on his puts because **no one** except some quants in a goldman sachs server room know this shit. The idea is simple about neutral delta on options that people take out, but the simple system interacts with every other thing in the stock market, and wow who couldve guessed it, like nearly any other element of the stock market predicting something by the day is nigh impossible. That guy talking about Gamma , Delta and margin calls is on weeklies. Hes no more autistic and equally retarded as all of us. Hes a chill guy though so dont berate a fellow brother.

**Now weve established the likelihood of longs getting margin called is far smaller than shorts, on to the options distributions**

**Two images now: Top one is before the end of the 15th, the other one is after market close:**

&#x200B;

[This shows the suspected melvin puts \(51000 contracts, 5 Million shares, rolled up from july, strike price $24\) and lots of big ITM calls.](https://preview.redd.it/t8odq9btgwb61.jpg?width=821&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61bb8a66e0ed83f0315921c295d1851a3c20c6c0)

[This shows the big put contract didnt get rolled over and the big ITM calls got exercised on friday. Large puts are underwater big timem while calls are in the big tendy zone.](https://preview.redd.it/3nqb33f0hwb61.jpg?width=675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9dc83f542dcc3565ae0424121146101b73cf0083)

These two graphs, show before market close and after. As we can see the massiver 51000 put contracts didnt get rolled over and the chances that those were melvins july puts rolled up is very high. They expired worthless. Lots of calls are printing big time while huge amounts of puts are worthless and bleeding money.

Something else we can extrapolate from the charts is that massive options trades are not present on the scale we saw before (tens of thousands).

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

We are seeing a discrepancy in the number of puts/calls opening up at the higher prices with calls gaining fast. This could show that some funds are now becoming optimistic on the long or short term prospects of gamestop. There are also more puts than options and if we assume this for shorts vs longs on margin (without even taking into account that all shorts are borrowed shares and pay interest further bleeding cash) then shorts are likely on more margin than longs.

Regardless fellow autists my main point is two show that the bears are underwater and the bulls are flying high with regards to options.

**Now lets compare this possible squeeze with others.**

Bear in mind this is the most shorted stock of all time, but differences in free float change the share price differently.

Kodak went from **$2.16 to $33.2**

Volkswagen went from **\~200 euro to nearly 1000.**

Overstock went from **\~$21 to $123**

Blue apron went from **$2.31 to $18**

Ive been seeing some estimated that 1 million shares is roughly a dollars move in share price. This maths is about to be pretty autistic so bear with me degnerates.

$1 now is 2.81% of the share price. Everything in the markets is exponential and based on percentages. So if we assume a full squeeze of ortexs estimated short interest (This assumes no sell off and no new shorts, new shorts can be positive or negative depedning on when in the squeeze they happen) **$35.5 \* 1.0281\^77 = $299.** GME to moon. 🌑 .

This shit can happen. Hold on.

**GME has squeezed and been manipulated before and it always happens around the console cycles. Shorts never win and they wont win now.**

&#x200B;

[This post right here I found months ago and got me in the squeeze from the honourable and valiant u\/Uberkikz aka Rod Alzman](https://preview.redd.it/4ysv7bzclwb61.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=27ac6ac58b6366f81b53fa75966733b8a8d61d3c)

Basically the crayon chart shows green (outstanding shares) orange ( short shares) purple (Market cap) and cyan (Share price). In 2006-2008 the share price rose in tandem with short interest ( Like now ) Until console releases when you can see an abrupt squeeze happend mooning the share price.

This happend to a degree in 2013 with the xbox one but worse conditions for the company and a worse console launch lead to slow short covering but the share price still mooned.

Now we get to the best part. History is repeating itself for the third time and the shares sold short are literally higher than the outstanding shares, which have been decreasing since 2010. Short shares are also at the highest point ever and GME hasnt had a brighter future, well ever. Ps5 and Xbox Series X. are the two most hyped consoles since the Ps2. This is setting up the foundations for massive price movements weve never seen before. This shit has literally never happend, ever. Uncharted waters and we are the captain.

**For the insurmountably retarded autists who think that the squeeze has happend look upon this and despair:**

IHOR IS A MEGA WIZARD

Ihor I quote:

>**A long-buying tsunami ... is the primary factor for the price move**

Ihor Dusaniwsky is managing director of predictive analytics at S3 a firm similar to ortex. He told bloomberg that the squeeze hasnt happend yet and that this was long buying. If someone knows this shit its him. He was talking about the tesla squeeze in january 2020. He has access to resources we can only imagine. Barrons cut his comment that the squeeze hasnt happend yet out it was that fucking bullish. All the media ramming down ""Short squeeze has happend"" down peoples throats because bears are fucking scared.

The bots on stocktwits spamming bearish sentiment should show how rattled they are.

Ratings are reviewed every quarter, and a review might be due this month (i.e. this coming week or next). Good chance that the agencies might upgrade GME to a B2/B, or even better to the next higher band (Ba/BB).

Have an exit strategy for GME,0.86,"No, this is not a 🌈🐻 post. This is a post reminding you that you need to know when to get off the rocket. 

If you look at the short squeeze of VW in 2008 you'll see the massive spike... and then a slightly higher trading price than before. If you think you'll get off at the peak, you're wrong. Some will, but most won't. 

You'll probably be too busy massaging your wife's bull or driving to the store to pick up more of his condoms to notice that the spike happened. It lasted for a day. 

You will watch the price go up and up, think about all the lambos you will buy, and when you check robinhood again... you missed it. The price never reached 420.69. Maybe it hit 420.54. Or 419.73. And you fucking missed it.

"GME - possible scenarios, FOMO and exit plans.",0.95,"TL;DR - No. You will have to read this one. It took a lot of research and typing to prepare this for you. But personally I'm a GME believer and it WILL fly 🚀. 

So you bought GME shares because strangers online told you to and you begin to ask yourself if you are retarded. The answer is yes, yes you are. But there is a good chance you are a lucky retard. If you are FOMO guy you have to decide which scenario is more likely and enter if you believe in happy endings. 
  
There is a lot of noise regarding GME and there is barely any good DD anymore. This is why I decided to put this together. You have to keep in mind that I am a retard myself and not an OG GME gang. I entered GME in January at $19, paper handed in worst possible moment at $32 because I thought squeeze has sqoze. I am now back in the game and reinvested my profit and more back into GME. Only reason why I feel competent to do this is because a) I read a lot about GME and shovel through all the noise to find meaningful info b) apparently no one else is willing to do it properly.  
    
So here it goes from the worst case to the best. All possible scenarios I can think of. If I miss anything or I messed something up, please let me know and I will update this list. This is not a financial advice. You have to make up your own mind and if you can actually read, do your own research.   
  
##**""WE ARE FUCKED!"" scenarios:**  
  
***Ryan Cohen played us all (EDIT: it appears this scenario is impossible. Leaving this up as another proof that I am indeed retarded.)***  
In this scenario RC sells or already sold his shares. We have been duped and it all has been pump and dump. We are all royally fucked.  

For this scenario:   
  
* RC, despite what you can read around here, is not your actual daddy. He is a business man looking to make profit.  
  
Against this scenario:  

* RC is fucking rich and if he wanted, he could already retire. 
* It would ruin his credibility.  
  
How do we know it is happening:  
  
* We learn through official paperwork that RC sold his shares, price reaches near 0 within minutes. 
  
My personal opinion: 
   
* Near zero chance this happens. But if its does, Price Target (PT) is very low.  
   

***GME is practically bankrupt***  
It turns out that RC comes in too late. GME is bankrupt in few months.  

For this scenario:   
  
* That was shorters play from the beginning.  
  
Against this scenario:  

* According to DD posted by people on WSB, GME books look good.  
* New console cycle, stimulus money, post COVID optimism all point that GME should be afloat longer then we need them to.  
  
How do we know it is happening:  
  
* We learn through official paperwork that GME is in a very bad condition. 
  
My personal opinion: 
   
* Very low chance that this happens due to againsts. But if its does, Price Target (PT) is 0.  
   
***Shorters pull a fast one on us***  
In this scenario institutions find a way to squeeze margin positions, outplay options and wait out long positions.  
  
For this scenario:   
  
* They have written the rules of the game and honestly, they know much better how to play it then us. 
  
Against this scenario:  
  
* If they could do it they would probably have already done it instead of loosing almost a billion in options last Friday.  
  
How do we know it is happening:  

* Serious price drop on Tuesday despite short restrictions.   
* Price falls in following days below $20 per share and refuses to come back up for a very long time.  

  
My personal opinion:  
  
* Non-zero chance this happens. It is possible. But IMO unlikely because I believe that if they could save their options they would have done it already. PT: uncertain but definitely below $20. $10-$15 if I had to guess.   
   
##**Neutral scenarios:**   
  
***We are in a deadlock aka. ""neutral but actually bad""***  
In this case old shorts are actually covered and we have new shorts on our hands. Price volatility and actual price slowly decrease. Both sides play a waiting game. RC and GME are radio silent for few months.    
 
For this scenario:  
  
* Institutions has already proven that they are committed to their shorts. And they will not admit defeat.
* Shorts have more money and patience.
* If shorts are replaced by new ones, they will not bleed (but that's unlikely).  
* We believe, but a lot of us have paper hands and/or can't afford to keep cash frozen to wait this out.  
* Hype will die down and with it our conviction.  
  
Against this scenario:  

* If the price settles above $30 or even better above $35, shorts will bleed money.  
* If the price remains low ($30 or below), there *may* come other large investors for a long position after they realize that this is a good value investment. This would trigger good scenarios.
  
How do we know it is happening:  

* Price volatility decreases over next week or two and settles probably somewhere between $25 and $35. 
  
My personal opinion:  

* Honestly I'm mostly afraid of this scenario. But at the same time it's not very likely that shorts are replaced. Then again, if nothing major happens relativly soon, this is still a likely scenario. PT: $25-$30 for months to come until one side wins.
   
***We are in a deadlock aka. ""neutral but actually good""***  
In this case price volatility slowly decreases, and both sides play a waiting game. RC and GME are radio silent for few months. But in this scenario we overcome our collective retardation and show how strong we are through our unity. Price slowly rises over next months as shorts slowly close their positions.   
 
For this scenario:  

* If the price settles above $30 or even better above $35, shorts will bleed money and will be covering their shorts.  
* One should never underestimate autists.   
  
Against this scenario:  

* United retards with diamond hands? Retail investors are market makers? I want to believe that we have that power but lets keep it real.
  
How do we know it is happening:  

* Price volatility decreases over next week or two and settles probably somewhere between $25 and $35. But the trend will become upward after that.
  
My personal opinion:  

* Hard to say. I think some actually good scenarios are more likely then this one.  
   
 
##**Good scenario:**  
  
***Slow and steady short squeeze***  
We win! Shorts are out of ammo, Friday dip was their last hail Mary to stop loses on their puts and are forced to close their position. GME begins it's burn to the moon!
  
For this scenario:  

* Shorts are already kind of fucked.  
* Big investment firms have proven many times before that they are arrogant and they can be very wrong.  
* GME is shorted into oblivion and unless it declares bankruptcy in next weeks or months they will HAVE to exit.  
* Any good news will make this only more likely (like new investor reveals that they are getting involved for a long position).  
  
Against this scenario:  

* Like I said before, we don't exactly know what shorts could have up their sleeve.  
* If shorts are replaced by new ones they will not be forced.   
  
How do we know it is happening:  

* Price jumps on Tuesday and continues the trend more slowly later even without short restrictions.  
  
My personal opinion:  

* It's likely and this is my bet. PT: very hard to say but could be anywhere between $60 and $200 or even way more in next weeks or months.   
   
##**Mother of all Short Squeezes**  
   
***We make history***  
It turnes out RC actually is your father. In next few days or weeks he reveals his master plan and shorts are royally fucked. They will sing songs about us.  
   
For this scenario:  

* All of the ""good scenarios"" fors, but the good news is actually something big RC or GME reveals that sends shorts running for their life. 
  
Against this scenario:  

*  RC signed a document that prohibits him from acquiring more then 20% shares and while float is low compared to shorts, it's not enough for MOASS.
  
How do we know it is happening:  

* Price opens at $200 or $400 and only goes up. Sorry FOMO guys, the rocket missed the Moon is already past Jupiter.  
   
My personal opinion:  
  
* I and many others dream that RC drops a bomb before Tuesday, but I honestly give this maybe 10% chance of happening. PT: a random number between $420.69 and infinity.   
   
##**Dear FOMO guys**  
If you decide that GME hype is not empty and that the Moon is within reach, please buy non leveraged shares. Margin, leverage or options could fuck you up short term even if in the end we win. 
    
##My position:  
254 long shares at $35.90, 205 leveraged shares at $36.48 (most protected down to $23, considering protecting them even more). Don't judge me, I am europoor.",2021-01-17 12:58:43

GameStop (GME) - Summary of both Bear and Bull cases,0.91,"**Disclaimer: This is not a financial advice and please do your own due diligence before making any financial decisions.**

**Source: Google, Reddit**

**None of this is originally written by myself and the purpose of this post is to consolidate information to portray perspective from both bears and bulls as neutral as possible for the benefit of new GME investors/speculators.**

**You are welcome to leave any valuable information or point out any misinformation in the comments and I'll add them to the post.**

**GameStop (GME)**

**Bear Thesis**

* Game console cycle in 2020
   * Boost in revenue due to new console cycle is temporary
   * Low margin on distributing game consoles
   * Main profit margin comes from software and virtual goods
* Brick & mortar is dying due to digitalization of gaming
   * Largest profit center for Gamestop is pre-owned and value video game
   * High revenue but low profit on new video game hardware and software sales
   * Gaming market is moving towards online game download instead of physical discs (Steam, Riot, Gaming Consoles)
   * It’s a matter of time game console manufacturers do not need them for distribution or service centers for their hardware
* Microsoft deal
   * A share of Microsoft Xbox’s digital revenue goes to Gamestop
   * Revenue share unannounced
   * What’s next after the multi-year deal end?
   * Revenue share does not include pre-owned console sales
* Continued closing of physical stores
   * Signifies accelerated closing of business
   * Directors taking profits after record week
   * Older board members sold part of their shares to profit after the record week
      * /u/Invisible0815 pointed out "" board members most likely sold because they will not stand for re-election in june. AND they didnt sell all their shares. one member had to sell because of his own funds regulations. i bet u, he didnt want to sell (hestia capital, he should be on cohens side cause he hates old management). ""

&#x200B;

* Bull case counterarguments from /u/baystreetdegenerate
   * Nintendo next game console in 2022
      * Okay, what happens in the downtime between console releases
      * **OP's reply**: Current generation of consoles are still being traded at GameStop, which is one of their revenue stream
   * Data is a key asset as the company can use it to analyse new trends in gaming Data can be monetized by selling it to gaming manufacturers or developers
      * Outside of tracking customer behavior on their website and sales and trade-in data what else can they even collect? Developers and manufacturers have multiple, and probably better ways of collecting data already and I don't think whatever sort of data GS can gather will be worth much
      * **OP's reply:** Yes, I agree with you that developers and manufacturers have their own way of collecting data. However, GameStop will be able to provide data on the market overview of the gaming industry if they manage to pull of being a centralized e-commerce giant
   * Turning physical stores into a showcase vendor’s games or new concepts
      * That's what youtube is for...
      * **OP's reply:** I believe there's a market for people who prefer physical roadshows or showcases compared to online videos.
   * Possibility to create a neutral platform for trading digital goods and charge a small fee for facilitating transactions
      * Like Steam's marketplace? Aren't most tradeable items on Steam from Valve games? This idea would require games from unrelated devs to have tradeable digital goods and that they would sign it over to GameStop's trading platform, but why would they do that? What would they gain out of it? Or are you talking about digital goods like digital copies of games? No gaming company would allow trading/reselling of digital copies of games. This idea is a non-starter.
      * **OP's reply:** I do agree this idea seem far-fetched, but there is a possibility that it can be pulled off.
   * E-sports tournaments/leagues to be held at physical stores
      * This idea of turning physical stores into social hangouts like the Warhammer DnD game stores is a little sketchy. Because 1) it requires investment into physical space and 2) it essentially turns the store into a PC bang which only really works in Asia due to costs and culture. Furthermore, why would I go out of my way to play games with a bunch of sweaty nerds at a GS store when I could just do it at home without smelling their BO?
      * **OP's reply:** They may convert several stores into PC shops for the purpose of E-sports leagues/tournaments only but not operate a PC shop business. There's definitely money to be made in the growing e-sports scene. E.g. advertising, streaming, etc.
   * RYAN COHEN: e-commerce
      * How does his expertise in pet food ecommerce translate into brick and mortar gaming stores?
      * **OP's reply:** We are speculating that the management are going to announce their plans between Apr-Jun 2021.
   * Low price to sales ratio at 0.4476 as at 15/1/21
      * Well, yes, because there's no clear path to long term revenue

**Bear case conclusion**: Business turnaround fails and trend towards book value at a price target of $5.

&#x200B;

**Bull Thesis**

* Nintendo next game console in 2022
   * 4th year into Nintendo switch’s 7-year life cycle, estimated new console launch in 2022
   * Continue to be a distributor for game consoles and benefit from Nintendo’s new console launch
* Estimated total addressable market for gaming of USD151Bn and growing
   * Established relationship with 42 million gamers through PowerUp Rewards loyalty program
   * 15.2 million members have purchased or traded at GameStop in 2019
   * Data is a key asset as the company can use it to analyse new trends in gaming
   * Data can be monetized by selling it to gaming manufacturers or developers
* Vendor partnerships
   * Turning physical stores into a showcase vendor’s games or new concepts
   * Opportunity to monetize publisher and console manufacturer relationships
   * Possibility to create a neutral platform for trading digital goods and charge a small fee for facilitating transactions
   * E-sports tournaments/leagues to be held at physical stores
* Brand recognition of GameStop and a lack of centralization for gaming
   * Opportunity for GameStop to be a centralized e-commerce platform for gaming consoles, digital games, merchandise, customization of computers, laptops, gaming chairs, etc.

* Board refreshment - Ryan Cohen, Alan Attal and Jim Grube previously from successful Chewy Inc. (CHWY)

   * Acceleration of digital transformation with new board members
* **RYAN COHEN**
   * Founder of Chewy
   * **Largest e-commerce acquisition.** Sold Chewy to PetSmart in April 2017 for **USD 3.35 billion**
   * Chewy went public in 2019 at a valuation of **USD 8.7 billion.**
   * Saw an opportunity in GameStop and took a stake of **12.9% as of latest SEC filing**
* Potential short squeeze (Speculative)
   * Estimated short interest of 138% not covered
   * Any positive news or materialization of bull case may send share price further up
   * Eventually shorts may have to cover and send the share price even higher
* /u/OCOWAx pointed out that /u/ethandavid did a DD on GME converting stores into PC kiosks, link below
   *  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme\_dd\_buildapc\_kiosks\_coming](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming) 

**Bull case conclusion:** Successful business turnaround and prove going concern. Being an e-commerce leader in the gaming industry.

$GME DD- Fundamentals: Why WSB Just Bought a Value Stock.,0.97,"I saw u/Unlucky-Prize post about the technical factors for $GME and felt inspired to make a post about the reasons why I‘m long this stock, which is the fundamentals.  I don’t do options or techincal analysis so please refer to other posts for that info.

$GME had been on my radar for quite some time but I finally dipped my toes in two weeks ago.  The basis for that wasn’t the potential for a short squeeze or short interest but the underlying fundamentals behind $GME.  I had posted a long comment in a previous thread and will expand on that to explain why I’m bullish long term for $GME.  I hope this helps.  This post is meant to be a personal opinion and not advice to buy or sell Gamestop.

🐻 Case: 

1.  Digital sales will make Gamestop the next Blockbuster.  

The digital game sales argument, like all 🐻  arguments, are weak.  The shift to digital will possibly occur in the next console cycle.  So maybe the 🐻 are right, but they’re right in 8 years which means they’re wrong now.  Additionally digital sales growth has decelerated and are returning to pre-covid levels as more
people go back to stores.  This trend should continue if the pandemic improves.  Additionally game publishers don’t care about the fractionally
larger margins from selling digital direct.  They only care about moving as many units as quickly as possible.  If they could sell the games on floppy disks they would.  Go read the public filings for any game publisher and they will tell you that they only care about selling what customers want and guess what, they still want physical. 

Blockbuster died because Carl Icahn got involved, killed Blockbuster’s attempt to pivot to a Netflix model by offering an online rental service and Blockbuster’s old business model relied on late fees.  Icahn insisted that Blockbuster's greatest asset was its physical location and late fees, killed the pivot and forced them to triple down on their old strategy.  Carl ended up losing 98% of his investment in Blockbuster.  There continues to be demand for physical movie rentals as evidenced by Red Box locations and Netflix still has a few million dvd by mail subscribers.

Gamestop has also recently started to pivot away from software sales into other areas and now software sales now make up large minority of Gamestop's total sales.  They're pivoting more towards physical goods and not just Funko Pops but also plan to expand more into new areas like PC gaming and hardware.  

Everyone knows that they signed a revenue agreement with Microsoft where Gamestop will get a cut of the lifetime revenue from Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.  This shouldn't sour the relationship with Sony or Nintendo.  If anything, Sony and Nintendo should be compelled to offer a similar revenue share agreement because Gamestop will inevitably push Microsoft products if Gamestop stand to profit more from it.  This will be a bigger deal in later years as console availability increases and consumers actually deciding to cross shop consoles as opposed to getting whichever new one is available right now.  Sony and Nintendo won't stop selling products through Gamestop because of this agreement with Microsoft, it's too large of a sales channel to give up.

2.  Gamestop will go bankrupt

This is highly unlikely to happen.  Gamestop managed to survive the single worst brick and mortar retail sales environment in modern history and ended the year with a cash surplus of a few hundred million.  Now its the new year and the beginning of a new console cycle.  This console cycle should last as long as the previous ones which is close to a decade, plus or minus a few years.  During that time, they will be printing money hand over fist selling consoles, new games, used games, accessories, protection plans, etc.

3.  Brick and mortar retail is dead.  Gamestop locations are shutting down left and right, this must mean they're going bankrupt.

Gamestop's average lease durations are actually quite short.  A lot of brick and mortar shops have lease duration lasting a decade but the average lease duration for Gamestop is just 2-4 years.  This allows them to close underperforming stores and open new ones very quickly.

Gamestop's saw e-commerce grow by 250% last quarter.  The company has been and continues to pivot towards a ""digital-first, omni-channel ecosystem for games and entertainment""

🐂 Case

This MOASS could be long and protracted like Tesla in all of 2020 as many continue to bet against Gamestop, instead of a sharp spike like Volkswagen, where Porsche played a large role in spiking the share price.  Keep in mind that at 1x sales, the share price should be $80-100.  Compare that with another retailer Chewy, which has a p/s of 6-7x.  Pet products also has a much lower TAM than gaming.  

This isn’t even factoring in a complete turnaround that RC has to be planning.  Look at the newest board composition.  Newest members are Reggie (my body is ready), the head of cloud 9 esports, and the current president Petsmart and Chewy. board member.  Ask yourself, are these the people that would join the board of a company that is expected to die in 5 years due to digital game sales.  

This has moved beyond a short squeeze yolo to a long term hold.  If RC succeeds in transforming this into the next Chewy, you’re looking at a 20x multiple.  This is based on fundamentals and industry tailwinds.  I added 10k shares weeks ago and added 20k shares at $38 because this thing is going much higher and idgaf about a few bucks in share price right now.  Also don’t attempt to time the market because you could be left behind at the launchpad.  

Simply put, if I told you there was a business that served a $200 billion total addressable market with very discerning and loyal customers with a lot of disposable income to spend on this market.  They have over 5,000 retail locations all across the world.  Last quarter, they saw Ecommerce grow by nearly 300% and ended a year where many other brick and mortar retailers went bankrupt with hundreds of millions of dollars in extra cash.  This company has a database called PowerUp consisting of tens of millions of customers that pay them a yearly premium membership.  They're starting a multiyear pivot into several new growing areas and have new board members that are industry leaders in each of those respective areas at the start of a new product launch cycle that will last a decade.  A young visionary founder who made his billions by creating a customer centric experience that defeated Amazon, who is well known to focus on one idea to the point of obsession, just became this company's largest shareholder and now controls the board.  I tell you this company trades at .5 sales.  Would you short or long this company?


TLDR:  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 But not because of the MOASS.

Some advice for those freaking out about $BB dropping from someone who sold $GME at a loss,0.96,"Hello WSB, first post on here and I made a Reddit account to participate in this fun time.  Had a blast browsing the last month, but my account is a month old so here we go. I learned a very hard lesson with Gamestop.  Super happy for everyone’s success and have enjoyed seeing all of the gains.  🚀🚀🚀

I bought 455 shares on December 24 at $21.97 and panicked when I dropped down $800 and ended up selling at a loss like a paper handed bitch. I thought, “Wow, I bought at the literal top and now it’s crashing” probably like some of you are now with BB.

Obviously this is my biggest regret so far in stocks and all I needed to do was BE PATIENT! Literally less than three weeks and I would’ve made over $10,000.  The market was awful Friday for all stocks.

I won’t make the same mistake again.  I agreed with the DD posts on GME and I do on BB as well.  Have patience, buy more shares if it goes down and do your research. 

Position:  700 shares @ $9.52

GME Margin Changes and their implications,0.96,"I initially wrote this as a comment but wanted to share it with the rest of you retards. There have been a lot of posts about GME this weekend but none have really gone into the implications of the [changes in margin requirements last week.](https://twitter.com/BooRileyMusic/status/1350159960877879296) This post gets long and rambly so up front **TLDR; retail shorts will be forced out creating upwards price pressure, but making the squeeze smaller and shorter** 

- The first question is, why are banks increasing margin requirements or removing margin altogether? 

There are two possible answers. Either the banks can't find the shares or they're trying to protect themselves from potential losses. Not being able to acquire shares seems unlikely, if that were the case we should be seeing low availability and high interest [which just isn't there.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) People assuming banks are worried about their clients money are wonderfully optimistic but woefully naïve. You can take your account from 100k to zero and the bank won't blink. What they're worried about is you taking your account from 100k to -100k. 

- The banks are protecting themselves. But from what? 

The longs, with 75% margin requirement, would have to take 75% losses before losses exceed their collateral, and after that their losses are capped. For a GME bull that entered at 35$ that means a share price of < $8.75. **Shorts, on the other hand, have their losses exceeding collateral at any price > $26.25 (assuming 35$ price) and are exposed to potentially unlimited losses.** So banks are exposed to far more risk from the short positions than the long ones.

- Banks are limiting their indirect exposure to shorts by restricting or removing client's margin. Why does this matter? Aren't most shorts institutional and not affected by margin requirements?

It's true, most of the short volume is big players, but there is a large amount of retail shorts as well. Not only will you have contrarians looking to capitalize off the correction, you'll have all the boomers and casual investors who see Cramer, CNBC, and SA articles predicting the fall. The assumption that most retail shorts are in puts I think is false. If you ask anyone on WSB they would probably make that play, but most retail investors aren't degenerate retards. Most are boomers who favor slow steady growth and get hard thinking about their 2% dividend from MCD. When they see Cramer railing millennials for taking some deadbeat stock through the roof, they log into fidelity or schwab and sell shares short. They're not on RH blowing their retirement on FD puts at 30+% premium.

- Boomers short. Banks restricting margin. What happens from here?

Last week we saw Schwab increase margin requirements first to 100% and then eliminated it altogether. Fidelity increased their requirements from 70 to 75%. Rumors are IBKR were planning to do the same. It's important to note that while removing margin does decrease bank's indirect short exposure, it has the possible effect of triggering a short squeeze if too many clients are forced to close their positions at once. That might explain why IBKR didn't end up changing their margin requirement on the same day as Schwab, and why these changes haven't been widely publicized by the banks themselves. So lets assume that banks take a gentle approach, progressively rising margin requirements before removing margin altogether. This forces some longs and shorts out of their positions over time as they become too high for the trader. But there's an interesting difference when the longs are forced to cover vs. the shorts. Say I'm long 200 shares of GME, 100 bought on margin. If the margin requirement increases from 75% to 100%, I can sell 12.5 shares and I now have enough collateral to cover the remaining position. If I'm short 100 shares with 75% collateral and the requirement goes to 100%, and I close part of the position with my collateral, my margin requirement will decrease but my collateral will decrease by an equal amount. **This means that the traders who forced out of long margin positions will only have to close a portion of their position while those forced out of shorts will have to close the entire position.** Moreover, given the recent price increase, it's likely that on average the shorts will need to cover more collateral than the longs. So shorts are more likely to be in financial distress and will have to close larger proportions of their positions than longs. The overall effect is net buying. 

- Short squeeze intensifies. Retail shorts forced out.

At this point in the lifecycle of a short squeeze with the stock running to new highs you typically have more and more short pressure- old shorts double down, new shorts see Cramer having a seizure and get fomo, some retard checks RH and sees a giant green dildo he doesn't agree with. This can potentially start the lifecycle over, if a new catalyst can force this new generation of shorts out. **By limiting retail shorting, big banks are effectively turning off the gas for squeeze continuation down the line.** 

- What does that mean for you? What do you do with this info?

Whatever the fuck you want. GME will probably have some amount of upwards buying pressure this week as banks further restrict margin, the magnitude of which will be proportional to the volume of retail shorts. Combined with /u/unlucky-prize's [prediction](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyoixl/gme_option_margin_and_other_factors_for_trading/) of volatility due to gamma hedging, I'm betting it's going to be a hell of a week. 

Positions: short 35p 3/19, 35p 4/16, 60p 1/29, long spread 50-60c 3/19

EDIT: Forgot 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Just to clarify, I would love to give a more precise prediction, but I don't think it's possible without knowing the volume of retail shorts. The best answer I can give is that the effect is >0.",2021-01-17 00:09:00

The next 'BB' ticker: BBY (Best Buy) DD,0.52,"**TLDR**: **BBY** Rocket Ship Emoji, Calls (2/26 120-130cs or a strike near their all time high of 123) and Shares

This is so similar to the other BB ticker DDs I did that most of it going to sound familiar. If you already bought BBY on accident this thinking it was BB or BBBY and need some reassurance, you're in the right place. First, going over my retarded investing tenets to make sure my dumb plays align with it: 

Overall:

1. I'm a retard and don't know anything.

Bull Market specific tenets (if you're a gay bear move on):

1. The market is undervalued, and 

2. Small businesses are getting crushed by governments to the benefit of big business, due to COVID.

What's that mean? Stocks may be overvalued, but the entire market is UNDERvalued, so your own internal stock valuations don't mean shit. Ask yourself, ""where the fuck else would I put my money?"" If you put it in a bank, printer goes BRRRR and you lose value. The only option is real assets: equities and real estate.

So this play, another boomer ass retail chain, sounds dumb as hell when I say it. That means it MUST be good. It's a big business, which our government is bending over backwards to give free money to. Big stores have cash on hand, which smaller businesses it competes with don't. It has an online presence. Online presence sounds ""duh"", except COVID is forcing the move to online quicker than even a skilled executive could pivot. And COVID/WFH means they get to drop their unprofitable stores, employee benefits, and dead weight faster without any blow back from consumers.

All of this is even BEFORE I look at [BBY specifically](http://investors.bestbuy.com/investor-relations/financial-info/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=14535249). Let's get into it:

Upside:

* BBY has cash on hand, $5.1B to be exact (which doubled since COVID began, from $2.2B to $5.1B. See? What did I say?)

* They grew online sales by 174%, AND store sales by 23%. They're being forcefully pivoted online, which is exactly what they NEEDED to do, so even if their leadership was dumb COVID has helped them. Additionally, every boomer is heading to Best Buy to set up their WFH setups with a blank check from their jobs that they can expense.

* They surprised with an EPS of $2.04 last quarter vs $1.70 expected. Margins are only getting better as they can reduce benefits, track every minute of an employee's logged in time, and shut down stores / fire people without any public backlash due to COVID.

* Remember how we all jacked off about GME console sales? BBY is BIGGER and sells more. Basically guaranteed revenue bump from this quarter that wasn't there last year, which will impress wall street because they're retarded like us and like when numbers go up. [The website has crashed over and over due to video game demand](https://www.pennlive.com/business/2020/12/ps5-xbox-series-xs-soon-to-be-restocked-online-at-best-buy.html). That sounds bad, but it's like with PTON being unable to fulfill orders... so many people want it that they're crashing the site.

* They're still below their ATH of 123 from just 2 months ago and they've only been performing the same or better since then.

* Most importantly in my mind, they are still undervalued because they didn't provide good guidance last quarter. Last quarter they beat every metric but the stock dropped from ATH of 123 to ~113 because [they said Q4 sales likely wouldn't be as high due to their high Q3](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/23/best-buy-bby-q3-2021-earnings.html). Well guess what, the market is already pricing in a slow Q4 for every business. There's uncertainty in this stock because of that, yet think of it: how could they have messed up extra console sales and stree-free closure of unprofitable stores? I mean, they could, which I'll go over below.

Downsides:

* Usually my largest gripe is with the people. In this case, [CEO Corie Barry](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2020/01/21/best-buy-ceo-corie-barry-is-a-corporate-iconshes-now-accused-of-having-an-inappropriate-affair-with-a-co-worker/?sh=47abb92f5ce4) is a traditional ""okay"" CEO with a few scandals under her. If she were a really skilled CEO, Best Buy could've been one of the best internet retailers ALREADY. But I'm still going with BBY since COVID is basically forcing them online faster than she would've pushed them.

So let's recap so far:

* An actual profitable business and growing online presence, with all the benfits of having cash on hand.

* Uncertain guidance leading to wall street hesitance

* Tailwinds (gov and economic) pushing them to greater profitability (not even including new console season).

I love this play and it's one of my sleepers. People should realize BBY is similar to GME, TGT, WMT, etc and will outperform it's ""brick and mortar"" expectations online.

Retarded play: Just buy shares if you're scared

Autistic play: **BBY** 2/26 $120-130c or near their ATHs. Also ROCKET SHIP EMOJI",2021-01-16 23:29:48

$GME DD- Build-a-PC Kiosks Coming,0.97,"TLDR: Gamestop is fielding PC build kiosks at a number of stores, BUY GME SHARES ROCKETS OUTBOUND 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀


Today I went into Gamestop with the intent of browsing around and using a $25 gift card I got for Christmas like a year ago. I have not been inside a physical GME store since at least 2018 when I bought an Xbox. I immediately noticed that they have a much wider variety of merchandise, everything from games to PC hardware to toys and clothing. So on that note I was looking to buy a new PC gaming headset since I noticed they ""have"" a ton of them. I grabbed one and went to check out. The manager informed me that they don't actually have them in stock or available to order- in fact, most of the items in the store were just display boxes for promotional purposes. I thought this was weird, but she explained that:

**1- They sell in-store items so fast that if they didn't display empty boxes the store would look entirely empty. She gave an example of 200 packs of pokemon cards that sold out completely within 24 hours**

**2- They are reluctant to fill the store with generic items that don't move fast, because that store specifically, among ""3-4 others in the state"" are going to be totally redesigned to accommodate for what she described to me as ""PC building stations"".**  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**3- They have been absolutely crushing it with sales and store interest due to COVID. She stated that people are buying things that she has never sold before, like niche Wii remotes and other items.""**

Now, we have speculated for some time that GME is going to pivot to PC parts and hardware. I noticed that they do stock some PC peripherals and a few components like graphics cards (older models, they had an NVIDIA 1660 in stock) and PSUs. 

HOWEVER, I haven't seen or heard anything regarding a full-on build station. The way she described it to me, is that customers will be able to totally spec out a PC gaming rig, and have it shipped directly to their house. She said there will likely be a dedicated store employee there to assist customers and provide advice. THIS IS FUCKING HUGE. Currently, you have to be pretty ""in-the-know"" to spec out a gaming PC properly, and the pricing makes it unrealistic for a lot of gamers. On top of that, I think there is a perception that you need a lot more technical skill to get into PC gaming. What GME is doing will allow the PC gaming market to bust wide open and become more accessible for a lot more people. And finally, some sort of agreement or deal with the big manufacturers (as hinted) would make this even more lucrative!

She also said that there is a huge push from upper management for store employees to get knowledgeable on PC gaming and hardware- she said management is pushing hard for the company to step into the future. Meanwhile during the 30 minutes I was in the store, probably 10-15 customers came through and bought at least minor items. Keep in mind this is in a strip mall in a Midwestern rust belt town- certainly does not fit the ""Next blockbuster!1!!!"" thesis.

Personally I believe this is a very bullish move from Gamestop- and bodes well for the future on top of the other well-established information out there. GME is and continues to be an excellent value play, not even accounting for the upcoming short squeeze. It sounds like the vision from Cohen and others at the top is already filtering down to the people charged with carrying it out. I plan to buy at least 50 more shares on Tuesday.

The changes started in OCTOBER.... what else happened in October? Ryan fucking Cohen. This is amazing news and hopefully we hear more about it soon in media/press release.

edit: oh shit... I called this other Gamestop and he said the ""Cohen news hasn't materialized yet""... I said him being ""CEO"" and he grunted, I think affirmatively

edit 2: called another gamestop. Overheard them talking about ""reset"" of stores when I asked which store in area was 1.5

"GME - Option, Margin and Other Factors for Trading Next Week",0.94,"**TLDR:** GME likely to be very volatile next week around $30, $35, $39-$40 especially. 39/40 pass would force about 5m shares of net-buying by MMs, while passing through 30 is about 4.5m shares of additional selling. 36/37 and 31/32/33/34 are more stable.  If price shoots up into the mid 50s  🚀🚀🚀🚀 , definitely duck for cover Friday.  Margin changes are actually bearish. Consider being on a brokerage that pays to loan your shares to shorts if long, because it's very profitable. Shorts can be squeezed, but so too can longs who use call options, and shorts who use put options.

Important note: The massive melt-up we had this week was a GAMMA SQUEEZE. Options market makers had to buy about 30m shares (or cover short shares, thanks Melvin Capital, then buy) while going on that run from 20 to 40 to hedge their positions. That as you know is more than half the float. My belief is that gamma effects will continue to be a big deal - but less of a big deal than last week because we have less options near the money now.  **Ironically, Melvin Capital made this melt-up far stronger, contributing 5m shares of forced buying in a rapid spike at $24/$25.**

**Details:**

I’ve seen a lot of discussions about GME over the past week that are missing important bull and bear elements in the thesis. This sub is so incredibly bullish  🚀🚀🚀🚀  that unsurprisingly, there’s more missing bear arguments than bull, and bearish information is sometimes perceived as bullish (such as the margin requirement increases, which I feel are net-bearish). But there's also missing bull information, namely that more new gamma ramps exist high than low it appears, and they appear pretty large.

I previously posted about some option dynamics last week, that seem to have played out to an extent. I actually lost money on my puts because the expressed vol was less than I thought, and Friday ended up playing out in a basically neutral way from a bull/bear perspective with a mere 10% drawdown. That post is here. I correct predicted the outcome, but didn’t predict the magnitude well enough and thus my trade sucked:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxb7dy/analysis\_of\_massive\_potential\_gme\_forced\_selling/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxb7dy/analysis_of_massive_potential_gme_forced_selling/)

In this new post, I’ll cover what I know about current option structure (and will update once updated data for Friday comes out), and the implications (TLDR: Mostly, expect vol around multiples of 5 in stock price), as well as other trading dynamic topics that I think are misunderstood or rarely spoken of.

I’m not going to talk about my opinion of the value of the stock or the turn-around plan. I’m actually in what is a modest put position for me at the moment (jan 22 $38 puts x 80), but I fully acknowledge this could go to the moon  🚀🚀🚀🚀  next week and I'll feel like a miniature Melvin capital (though shorting at $38 is a lot smarter than at $17) and probably deserve it in that case.

**Current Option Structure:**

I will update this as new data gets in, but you can see big concentrations of options at 30, 35, 39/40 and 45. There isn’t open interest data for Friday, but volume suggests there are further ramps at 50/55/60, but they are probably smaller than the 39/40 and 30 ramps. Normally, dealers are going to be long calls (from people selling covered calls) and short puts (From people buying protection). On GME I think we all know it’s short calls and short puts, since people are buying tons of calls from them, and also speculating with puts. As such, dealers are extremely short gamma, and that means that prices accelerate from dealer activity greatly. When the stock sells, the dealers have to dump stock (or short it). When the stock goes up, dealers have to buy.  **I believe that the Wednesday melt-up was as much a short squeeze as a gamma squeeze, as the price moved over a bunch of OTM options, forcing dealers to buy as much as a bit more than 1/2 of the total float of the company to hedge! Further evidence of this is that the stock went parabolic but then stopped being parabolic once past the peak option strike available on Wednesday - $40. Without the dealer lift, the rally slowed a lot.** This is why I think it looks as much like gamma squeeze as short squeeze. It’s also why gamma positions this week are important, but they are smaller than what was available going from 20 to 40.

These patterns are most sharp at these large concentrations of strike prices, so the stock can jump from 39 to 41 a lot easier than from 36 to 38 as an example. On average, it’s about $1m of stock bought/sold by dealers per percent change. To put in context, there was a jump Friday where about 250k shares got bought and moved the price 5%. That means that if accurate, dealer activity might have been up to half in that flash.   **We don’t yet have the Friday data, but there was a lot of Friday volume. This amplification may be greater next week. This week had a gamma event on Wednesday, after which there were a ton of ITM WSB calls and OOM Melvin puts that don’t have gamma, and thus the price de-volatilized somewhat. But we may now be in a situation with a lot of near the money options, which means we could see very large gamma squeezes up or down again.**

Here’s the structure, I’ll update once there is Friday OI data available. This chart assumes that calls are positive gamma – they will all be negative gamma in this case, so predict accordingly.

[https://imgur.com/a/czrKy6X](https://imgur.com/a/czrKy6X)

Also worth mentioning is the expirations next week. Here’s the current structure for next week, using Thursday data, which I’ll update once I get Friday data:

[https://imgur.com/a/4wKTspB](https://imgur.com/a/4wKTspB)

This is a lot less bearish than the Friday we just had, but again, I’ll update once I get the data. It’s still a net sell on Friday as those option positions get cleared out (people sell to realize, and then buy other things in general), but more like under 1/10th of float vs the 1/3 of float we were staring at this Friday. Unless people piled into ITM calls Friday, which I find highly unlikely. As such, the downwards force this coming Friday, if this Friday was -10%, is more like -2 or -3% in a vacuum.  However, the higher the prices go into Friday, the more selling this in turn causes Friday, so in a world where we end at $55 on Thursday, I'd definitely not go into Friday long as this forced selling increases.

My sense out of all of this is:

\- The current gamma structure provides more ramps up than down from $35, but there are strong ramps in either direction. BUT, the volume suggests a lot of new put positions were established. On net – volatility up, not bearish or bullish. You could maybe argue very slightly bullish I guess.

\- There is some forced selling this coming Friday, but if that was the driving force yesterday, it would be a -3% or -2% not a -10%.  Slightly bearish. Can change based on price.

\- If the stock moons this week, I would encourage you to approach Friday with care, and a more bearish or defensive mentality, even if fundamentally bullish. Similarly, if we are in the 20s, there are situations where friday eventually becomes forced buying from a ton of short term puts printing, and a bear would not want to be short into Friday.

\- A LOT of capital went into OOM puts and calls this week targeting the week after. If the stock is not volatile, a lot of speculators bleed out on both sides. And those numbers may update my assessments above one way or another.

**Margin Changes**

There was a lot of talk about how various brokerages have increased margin requirements on GME stock. Some set to 100% (Schwab), others set up a bit (TDA from 70% to 75%),  others rumored to be planning but haven’t (IBKR). The reaction of the sub is that this is bullish. It’s actually bearish, albeit slightly.

The reason is that most of the shorts, in my opinion, are institutional. Retail will typically short with OOM puts which don’t cause much actual selling to hedge. Institutions short GME are going to have that in a giant account with a ton of other assets, so changes on margin placed on them, if indeed that happened, wont margin call them except in scenarios where GME goes up 20x in a day or something.

On the other hand, if you are a retail trader where half or all of your positions are GME, this margin change does effect you, especially if you were out on margin, and it makes it harder to buy more shares. I don’t think many retail traders are directly short the stock.  Anyone want to raise their hand and admit they are 50%+ GME and on margin to do it?

Also, consider the context -retail brokerages just did this on the back of everyone here buying shares long. That to me suggests they are looking at customer accounts, seeing some over-extension, worrying about it, and setting the rule to prevent themselves being burned. Some of you have a net worth of mostly GME in your levered account. If that gets squeezed down and a liquidation is forced those brokerages won’t be seeing the money.

So, I think the margin changes are a bit bearish, but not hugely so. I would also urge you bulls to not set yourself up to be squeezed, which is my next point.

**Squeezes and Short Interest**

It’s true that this stock has high short interest. There’s contradictory evidence as to if the shorts went up this week or went down. IBKR share availability suggests it may have went down, other sources suggest up, and I'll update once we have solid post-Friday data that someone posts. However, just because the short interest is high, doesn’t mean that it can be squeezed easily from here – Wednesday I think was that squeeze. A lot of the old shorts may have covered then, and we may be looking at new shorts. It’s also possible that these institutional shorts hedged with previously deep oom call options and ironically further helped create the melt up, but didn’t take losses after a certain point. It is worth noting though that MMs engaging in 30m shares of buying (Some of which was short covering) only doubled the stock - and they are now long stock and will loan it out to short sellers all day.

Additionally, while GME longs here on stock are not squeezable if not on margin, those of you on OOM call options ARE squeezable, and those of you on ITM options are in a sense even more squeezable. OOM call options decay if the stock doesn’t go up, and then the shares dealers bought to hedge the call they sold you get sold back into the pool. ITM options, when sold, do the same but more powerfully – selling a very ITM call option on GME means a dealer immediately goes out and dumps 100 shares of GME on the market. If you in turn buy 100 shares, it’s netural, or if you buy a bunch of NTM calls, you might even cause a net buy. But, those will tend to cause selling if people take money off the table and as time goes on.

And yes, there are a TON of new put options, and those get squeezed out too.

So there is a dual squeeze potential here – shorts vs their losses and borrow fees and decaying option positions which cause dealer buying, and longs using margin and longs in call options fighting time and also watching dealers dump their hedged longs.

One other thing -  contrary to what I sometimes read, Melvin Capital was already squeezed, or rather, their dealer was by proxy.  Wednesday was that squeeze. They bought a bunch of ITM put options which forced dealers to sell a ton of stock to hedge. When the price shot up, dealers bought into that short they made to hedge the Melvin puts, and now the Melvin puts expired worthless. Melvin can not be squeezed further unless they enter a new short position of some type. They lost 55M on that trade, and they manage 20 billion. They may be back in it at this point, shorting this even harder is within their power...

Lastly, it has been brought up that some of the GME short, especially those puts lurking at $2 and $1, are hedges by bond holders against bankruptcy, or are hedges by those who sold CDS to bond holders to hedge their short CDS. Those are going to keep accumulating because bankruptcy is possible (though unlikely) in the few year range, and getting those puts now is basically free. But they won't affect the price since they are so far OOM.

**Uptick Rule**

Because the stock was down a lot Friday the uptick rule was triggered until eod Tuesday. That means shorts can’t sell at the bid to force down price they can only sell at the ask. In practice this won’t matter a ton since you can still buy puts to make a dealer do this, and my understanding is they aren’t subject to that rule anyway. EDIT - dealers do have to obey this but appear to be net long the stock currently so would not be affected. I thus feel this is very slightly bullish.

**Yield Enhancement Program**

A pro tip I have for this sub is – if you intend to hold a ton of long stock that is in high demand by short sellers, you should get paid to lend it to short sellers. That’s how the option dealers make a lot of their money – I’m sure citadel is making a killing holding a ton of GME stock to hedge, and promptly lending it to hedge funds at 30% borrow rate, while having very little risk.

Many brokerages don’t pay you for lending your shares out, but IBKR does. Right now, if your GME shares are loaned out, you get something like 15% annualized in rebates. WeBull, Fidelity and Schwaab also will do this, but I've not used their programs, and you probably have to ask them to sign up. This doesn’t work if the shares are in margin, they have be fully paid and settled, but it is a substantial extra if you are a long-term believer in the stock, and on other brokerages, they get paid instead of you.  If any other brokerages have this feature that are non-institutional, please post and I’ll add.

It is worth saying that you reduce the cost to short if you do this. I always allow it on my account though because I like the money more and think I’ll beat the shorts eventually anyway. Some money managers never do it so as to not fuel the shorts. But it does pay.

**A Few Other Thoughts on Shorts**

Institutions do sometimes hedge large short positions. It is possible that some of the calls held on Wednesday that caused the giant explosion up were hedges for short positions held by hedge funds/family offices and others.  The fact we didn't see a lot of selling Friday suggests that at least the near the money ones were mostly NOT held as hedges, otherwise they would've been more monetized. But, it's possible that the short pain is less than thought. We just don't know.

**Conclusion:**

I think the major factor here remains simply the desire of this sub to pile new money in. However, it’s hard to maintain this volatility level and ever higher prices for more than a few weeks without additional catalysts because options are getting pricey and decay will set in, and the higher the price, the more money is required to buy a share.

\- The margin changes, again, are definitely bearish. How bearish? That depends on how many of you guys bought a ton of GME shares on margin and whether or not we gap down Tuesday. I don't think it affects the short interest much.

\- The option situation is probably net bullish Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday, but net bearish Friday (slightly)… but does mean that next week can be insanely volatile

\- Price moves are easier in the vicinity of $35, $30, $39, $40, and to a lesser extent, $45, $50, $55, $60 due to gamma 'ramps'.

\- I’ll post new data when I get it. It could change the picture to be more clearly bearish or bullish, not just volatile. I'll try to lay out estimates of how many shares MM hold, and then updated gamma ramps, as well as expected MM position holdings at various price levels at the end of the week.

**Update 1-19 AM -** My tool hasn't received nasdaq data yet, but eyeballing the chart it's more or less as before. Large gamma ramp at 40 (huge option positions at 39/40). You saw this at open when you guys bid the stock, and MMs had to buy about 5m-6m shares to not be underwater, providing perhaps 2/3 of the initial buys. We then aw a loss of momentum in the gamma dead zone of the 40s. As I said, lifting into the mid to high 40s is a heavy. Bulls, you should not really pay a lot of attention to gyrations from 37-42, up or down, that's just dealers rolling over options. You had a strong start in any case, but that price zone is going to be extremely volatile this week.",2021-01-16 18:39:00
Updated Potential Holdings of GME,0.97,"Hello Fellas, due to the monumental rally of GME this week followed quickly by another long weekend, I've been stuck with too much time on my hands and absolute crack energy flowing through my veins. To capitalize on these factors I've decided to create an updated estimate on the holdings of GME. 🚀

As seen in this post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/?ref=share&amp;amp;amp;ref_source=link), there are a substantial amount of shares that are not for sale. I have added to it with additional holders who may be unlikely to paper hand.

Holding | Percent of Total
:--|:--
Cohen and other Board Insiders | ~19%
FMR LLC | 13.67%
BlackRock | 12.33%
Vanguard| 7.58%
Senvest | 4.62%
Permit | 2.8%

These are holders from the previous post, and I skimmed 0.26% of Cohen and board insiders (i.e. Sherman, James bell, etc.) due to the small recent sell-off of the outgoing directors, just as a rough estimate.

I also want to direct attention to these additional holders that may not sell easily:

Holding | Percent of Total
:--|:--
Dr. Michael J Burry | 2.44%
WSB Gigachads | ~6%

Burry's holdings were taken from [here](https://fintel.io/i/scion-asset-management-llc), 1.7 million shares as of 9/30/20.

WSB estimated holdings were taken from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6jjm3/wsb_owns_58_of_gme_gme_survey_update/?ref=share&amp;amp;amp;ref_source=link)

Now Burry's holdings are outdated so take it with a grain of salt, but I doubt he trimmed most of his position before even busting the shorts. The WSB figure is an estimate and also outdated, and doesn't necessarily separate Gigachad Diamond Handers from Paper Handed Scrubs but it is a solid benchmark.

This brings the total to 68.44% of GME shares fairly secure in our mighty grasp, equating to ~47.7 million shares. Now, if you want to take in to account that GME sentiment has been absolutely skyrocketing here recently, you could place WSB holdings at 8% bringing us to 70.44% and 49.1 million shares. At a plausible stretch of 10% we would be at 72.44% and 50.5 million shares. This of course is not counting any other potential retail gigachads that could be found elsewhere such as those speds at stocktwits etc. I also wouldn’t discount the possibility that we hold more than 10%, you guys have seriously been wildin.

That means there could be anywhere from only 22 million shares to 19.2 million shares unsecured. To add to this, we have seen recent posts stating that shares shorted have actually INCREASED from the previous estimate to [79.52 million](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky4xmk/gme_shorts_havent_covered_theyve_added_only_added/?ref=share&amp;amp;amp;ref_source=link), giving a possible short to float (79.52 shares short/19.2 mill shares available) of ~400% depending on WSB estimates.

It gets better. I know were all hoping for a big day on Tuesday, and of course we would need big news for that to happen right? I mean look at the VW squeeze, over the weekend Porsche released a statement that they had upwards of 70% of the shares and that catalyzed the squeeze. What do we have that could set this off?

Ryan FUCKING Cohen. The legend still has 7% worth of dry powder sitting around and if he releases an increase in his holdings it could end this for the bears. A 7% increase would bring us to anywhere from 75.44% secured (lowest WSB estimate) to 79.44% secured (Highest WSB estimate), that would be a 550% short to float with only 14.3 million shares available. What are the chances he does that though right? Its not like hes an activist investor ;)

In short, bears are fuk and hold the fuckin line you autists the ball is literally in our court. Ill add rockets later.

This is obviously not financial advice, I’m as retarded as you guys but also a little autistic 

TLDR: The mechanisms that drive a short squeeze have shifted further in our favor. We now have more shares shorted and less shares available. If this continues the squeeze will be more violent.

WSB could own as much as 10% or more of GME shares, it goes without saying but paperhanding is the only thing that can hold us back.

On GME and what to expect Tues/Wed (DD),0.97,"Hi everyone,

I'm going to use this space to say what I would expect Tues/Wed regarding GME (obviously not an expert).

# First some facts:

1) There was an obscene amount of shorts of GME before it went up last week (138%+ of float). There is now still an EVEN MORE obscene amount of shorts of GME (120-170% of float as high-quality estimates).

2) There has been over a month of likely ""naked short selling."" Aka, ILLEGAL market manipulation (Sells of unconfirmed shares that then end up not going through) in an attempt to further drive down price (27 days on NYSE Threshold securities list, since Dec 8th).

3) Fees to borrow GME have gone up significantly (sitting around 30% atm) and required margins have increased at brokers (75% for Fidelity, 100% for Schwab). This means those brokers are less confident in it going down, and that there are less available shares floating around (lower volumes).

4) Friday, there was a huge early shorting of the stock (the rapid 10% drop) that led to Rule 201 being invoked (stock can only be shorted on an uptick until EOD Tuesday). How do I know it was likely shorting? Because the drop stopped as soon as the Rule was invoked.

# From these facts, what are conclusions I have drawn?

1) Investors (firms or otherwise) who have shorted GME are **repeatedly doubling down**. Big players are doing so to directly (and sometimes illegally, see naked short selling above) manipulate the market in a downward direction. **They have been working on this for months, making the stock undervalued by far,  which is why short volume has been so high, and are continuing to manipulate this stock downward in an attempt to make those earlier shorts less of a failure.**

2) They believe the current price increase will not be sustained or, more like IMHO, that they can out-short any increase that is sustained, so they are paying increasing fees on those shorts every day until the price drops enough (and it needs to drop A LOT for their earlier shorts).

# So what do I think will happen Tues/Wed?

**1) On Tuesday, SEC Rule 201 is still in effect. That means that short sellers can only sell shorts on ""upticks"" (aka, they can only short at prices above the current market price). I expect that those short sellers will continue to double down, so we may see a price ceiling come into effect. Every time the price increases, the shorting can happen so they'll short it. I expect volume will be relatively low, and the price will not move very far.**

**2) On Wednesday, SEC Rule 201 is not in effect yet. If price moves significantly upwards on Tues, I would almost definitely expect an early short on Wednesday in an attempt to drive small profit selling and further drop the price. If price moves significantly downward on Tues, I would expect the same early shorting in an attempt to induce panic selling. Finally, if price doesn't move much on Tuesday, its much more of a toss-up on their strategy, but I would (personally) anticipate another attempt to short sell the price down as we saw Friday (deep pockets of shorters, already in very deep on shorts).**

**TL;DR: I think shorters gonna keep shorting (legally and illegally) so everyone should be prepared for that. They think the risks of losing older shorts outweighs the risks of additional shorting/the fees of new/old shorts. They've done this level of consistent, repetitive shorting/market manipulation before and have only paid for it a handful of times.**

Just sharing my opinion of what happens next. I'm not here to convince anyone to do anything.

Possible Exit Strategy for GME Shorts?,0.79,"So this actually happened in my dream today but I was wondering if this could be possible.

As of now, if the shorts have not covered during the last three days, we're looking at around 1.2:1 ratio of short to float. and some people were saying short interest is like 250% because of institutional buying or something idk I'm too retarded to understand.

Anyway, in my dream, one of the institutions that bought a lot of shares during the last 3 days, offered a short-exit package for a ridiculous but a very favorable price to all the shorts wanting to cover. This was done in the dark pool so the stock price did not change at all and the shorts who purchased these packages got out safely while the institutions made lots of money. 

It was a win-win situation for both because the institution did not have to worry about missing the timing to sell during the short squeeze and shorts were able to cover without frantically looking for shares to buy. 

I don't know enough to know if this is legal or this is even possible but in my head this seemed like a possibility so I'm posting here to get more insights.",2021-01-16 17:50:41

Long-time lurker here, finally starting to post with the imminent GME squeeze

Thought it would be helpful to give a VERY BRIEF, slightly more serious explanation on the current situation to the influx of new members:

&#x200B;

Before we start, here's a nice little glossary of autistic terms used around here:

🚀  = stock gonna go up

💎🙌 = holding onto a stock like a god

📝👐 = selling like a loser

&#x200B;

So, currently Gamestop (GME) is on a pretty inevitable short-squeeze path, what does that mean? It means it's about to do something like this:

&#x200B;

[fuckin ridiculous am i right, a more recent example would be tesla \(TSLA\) if you think this is old boomer shit](https://i.redd.it/frjx9fil1qb61.gif)

Now the mechanics of it why short squeezes happen are a little complicated for beginners but here are some threads and other links explaining them IF you want to learn more:

[WSB Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/)

[Boring Boomer website explanation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp)

There also a lot of other factors at play here, but go search that on your own, there's tons of good threads here on WSB

AND if you're really serious about it, ACTUALLY RESEARCH GAMESTOP, its annual revenue, market cap, stocks in general, but lmao none of y'all gonna do that so:

So should you buy GME stock asap?

Do you like free money? Fuck yeah buy that shit 💸💸💸

&#x200B;

HOWEVER here are some VERY IMPORTANT things you should be mindful of in these upcoming weeks:

* The very tippy top of Short-squeezes last fairly long, in the picture above (Volkswagen) it shot up and stayed there for a whole day (at around $600, it did spike at a crazy $1000 for a couple hours though), SLOWLY coming back down over a few days, then finally dropping. THIS MEANS this isn't some minute-by-minute play here, you have some time, just make sure you are prepared.
* In these coming days (or maybe weeks) GME price will waver up and down as the big corporations (Melvin 👿) start trying to cover their asses until eventually it will start spiking like crazy, the Short-squeeze will have started
* Some shit might go down this TUESDAY, it might not, but some shit will ***definitely*** go down within the next week or so as corporations are losing big amounts of money as time goes by
* THE LONGER PEOPLE HOLD 💎🙌 ONTO THEIR STOCKS, THE HIGHER CORPS LIKE MELVIN WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM, this brings me to my next and final point

&#x200B;

# The importance of holding 💎🙌

The price of GME will most likely STAIRCASE upwards (going UP then down then UP, etc), as corps begin to short, people with 📝👐 (pussies) will begin to sell because of the ""profit"" they're making

Not only will you regret it when the squeeze hits its peak, but you are letting the shorters get off easy by giving them cheap stocks

Imagine this:

you bought GME at $35, it goes up to $100, you panic sell cuz holy shit thats profit, you check again in an hour and see that GME is now $200 because of the many godlike 💎🙌 we have in this sub, then you start crying because not only did you hurt the cause, you missed out on a shit ton more money

***This is the importance of holding 💎***🙌

&#x200B;

Also if you read the DD (basically theory on future prospects) on Gamestop, you'll realize that it actually does have a pretty bright future, so while this may be a pump and dump for many, **I'm sure this stock will actually reach quite a large number in the not so distant future** (just google Ryan Cohen)

* My current estimation for the price target is:
* It will ***definitely*** hit $100 within the next week
* It will probably spike to around $200-$300 for a day or two
* It has a small chance of going fucking nuclear and going past $300   🚀   🚀   🚀  (small chance but definitely possible)
* ***It of course, also has a chance of doing absolutely fucking nothing***

Now, I didn't want to speak boomer but this is important as this subreddit is quite literally an addiction for a lot of people, DON'T PUT MONEY IN THIS STOCK IF YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE, WE'RE LITERALLY A BUNCH OF RETARDS (sometimes smart retards)

THIS IS NOT FINANACIAL ADVICE AND IF YOU LISTEN TO ME OR ANYONE ELSE ON THIS SUBREDDIT YOU ARE ALSO RETARDED LIKE ALL OF US

This squeeze is most likely NOT (fully) caused by us, (assuming we're around 10% of the shares) but I mean, 10% is quite a big number so we do have a little control.

&#x200B;

# TL;DR:

# THE MORE OF US THAT HOLD 💎🙌 THE HIGHER GME WILL🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀

# IT MIGHT BE A ROUGH FEW DAYS OR WEEKS BUT DO NOT WAVER, HOLD💎🙌 AND YOU WILL BE REWARDED, SELL📝👐 AND YOU'LL FOREVER GET LAUGHED AT BY EVERYONE HERE LMAO

&#x200B;

thank you for coming to my ted talk, and yes i do have many shares

&#x200B;

**edit:** Adding a few notes here since I've already gotten so many questions lmao:

* Do NOT buy stocks with leverage/margin, as corporations can basically borrow those, aka those stocks aren't yours (as I understand it) Also stocks are better for the squeeze than options, so please try to buy stocks
* What to do if it GME plummets? You can do whatever you want to do, however I'll tell you my personal plan: I have quite a bit of money in this but I would have NEVER put it in if I didn't believe in the long term, so if this squeeze ends up being more of a pinch (very small chance), I'm not selling shit 💎🙌 Again, refer to the DD and Ryan Cohens personal letter, this shit has the potential to grow 3-5x within a few or even this year
* If you ever think about wavering and think ""ooh man i'm really playing with big money i should sell 📝👐"" think about all the other people in here backing this shit up. We have hundreds of daily YOLO threads of people dumping money in this, hell /u/deepfuckingvalue our [god](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxeq23/gme_yolo_update_jan_14_2021/) LITERALLY has like 8 million dollars riding on this shit, so learn from him and 💎🙌 my brothers
* Again... if you're concerned or uncomfortable, do your own research, and come to your own conclusions. Don't take advice from retards if you don't want too

&#x200B;

**EDIT 2: DD BOOGALOO:**

If the sheer amount of autism wasn't enough to sell you on GME, here are some pretty boomer, but very important links that go into detail:

[**Gamestop's very own 2020 Holiday Sale Report**](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results)

Important thing to take away here:

""**E-Commerce sales**, which are included in comparable store sales, rose **309%** and represented approximately **34% of total company sales**, with total worldwide E-Commerce sales year to date reaching over **$1.35 billion, far exceeding the Company’s $1.0 billion growth objective**""

This is obviously important as Cohen is most definitely pushing for bigger online presence with GME in the future, and uh yeah just the fact that it's up by *that much* is uh... 🚀🚀🚀

A gift that keeps on giving 🎁,0.89,"You, you are the gift, let me tell you why.

Let me propose an idea. 

Now I know most you cannot read so I’ll post the TL;DR NOW to try and capture the last few seconds of your attention speed. 

TL;DR  > Pinned post, Voluntary charitable donation discussion. 


 Now listen up all, this week has been absolutely incredible for some of you, and most of you must be juiced up to the tits in the most delicious tenderloins any human could ever taste. 
And this must be Extra juicy during the pandemic, this means more freedom, a chance to come out of this current phenomena not being a wage slave 9-5 pre-boomer ( boomers aren’t born, they’re made )

But remember, not everyone is having chicken tenders for dinner tonight my friends, the pandemic has stricken down the lives of many individuals, and the feeling of hopelessness during a time of uncertainty not only happens to the individual but to the us as a whole. It’s almost just like what has happened recently with $GME and Melvin capital. But instead of an institutional investor shorting a stock, it’s a situation that is shorting the people, other humans, people just like you and me. 

So how about instead of all the fucking bullshit posts saying

 “LOL WHAT IF WE ALL COLLECTIVELY ORGANISED TO PUT HEAPS OF $$$$ IN A SINGLE TICKER AND MOON IT TOGETHER BOYS ? WELL ORGANISE THIS ALL ON A PUBLIC FUCKING WEBSITE THAT ANYONE CAN ACCESS 

IT LITERALLY CANNOT GO TITS UP “ 

which gives the place a bad name and is a one way ticket to getting this sub erased from the internet. 

Why don’t we replace it with a pinned post for those who would like to volunteer to donate charities ? 

It’s similar to market manipulation, but instead of a bunch of over excited basement dwellers high on adderal trying to attempt a pump and dump, how about just dump our collective money into one charity ? Albeit a small amount each, how ever much you fucking want be it $1 or $10000

I love you guys who are constantly posting your donations and don’t get me wrong this is doing a big difference and is helps so much, but , as most of all know, the difference between $500 dollars and $100 000 dollars is life changing for some people. 

Imagine what good we could do with our collective autism ?!?!

Instead of giving ourselves a bad name let’s start showing people we can do good, remember retards, we are on the big screen now. 

For those of you who still don’t understand 

We all vote one charity or just discuss a charity in the comments, then on a specific day everyone donates at once. This injects an incredible amount of money into a single charity or organisation that can help on a much larger scale. 

Think of it like you are investing in human kind, as a human being, do you want to see you’re own species get shorted to bankruptcy ? Or do you wan pump the human race into interstellar space ? 

Because that’s how we get there, TOGETHER. 


Have a good long weekend everyone, may your positions 🚀🚀 and your brains remain smooth.  

Good luck and Godspeed!!!

Tin-foil hat theory: Was $BB a pump and dump?,0.73,"I'll preface this with a disclaimer. I'm most likely too deep into GME to see the big picture, and that's why I want some perspective from other users here. Things just *appear* to align, but sometimes things happen on their own and isn't evidence of a conspiracy altogether. I want this to be the beginning of a discussion, and possible investigation, not the end of one. 

Here's the quick hypothesis, and I'll post some brief supporting pieces of data below.

The upcoming short squeeze has the old money scared as fuck, and pissed as fuck at us. They've altogether already lost *nearly a billion shorting GME.* I'd love to see that loss porn. 

Question: How much would it cost to hire a troll farm to start a disinformation campaign? Something to help distract even a portion of a large group of users away from their quarry? Astroturfing is a real big thing, it's been used all over reddit for at least the last 5 years or so, facebook, etc. With the recent election wrapped up, I suspect these troll farms probably have a lot of availability for large firms who have a lot to lose. For just a couple million dollars, they could save hundreds of millions, by infiltrating this subreddit. And I wonder if they have? I think it's a safe assumption they know about us. Especially after the mainstream attention we're getting.

So that's the hypothesis. And here's some of my supporting ideas that I'd really hesitate to call ""evidence"".

GME starts the blowup on Jan 13th. The very next day, the long dormant BB starts blowing up a little bit. I don't know when BB started getting pumped on this subreddit and I don't know where to find out, but I *suspect* that started on **the day** GME started blowing up.

On Friday the 15th, the day a lot of shorts have to be paid back in there was a massive push by brand new accounts, heavily pushing BB, and a lot of other things. A lot of ""fellow kids"" kinds of posts, every 10 seconds there was a new one. Most were filtered out by the mods, and a lot of them were down-voted quickly by people on /new. I'd be really interested in seeing some figures on this though, or maybe an opinion on how much more active Friday morning was compared to a normal day from a mod like /u/zjz for instance who I know was cleaning up a huge amount of garbage posts. 

To be fair there were a huge amount of garbage GME posts too. But I'd like to think after a 100% gain over 2 days there would be substantial buzz here, and with the MOASS on the horizon that we ALL know about, you'd think that GME would be once again the only topic of discussion here. But it was far less posted about from my totally subjective, totally biased perspective. 

After hours on Thursday, BB was also pumped up quite a massive amount. This is what I see as the bait at the end of the fishing hook. But then despite all of the YOLO posts I saw on /new the stock continued to drop throughout the day, ending back where it started at the EOB on Thursday. I don't know how much it would cost to pump BB from $9 to $10, but I bet it costs less than the billions hedge funds stand to lose on GME going through the roof.

So I know this sounds nuts. I know I'm biased, and I'm trying to make sense of yesterday. But also, doesn't some of this align too well? Can anyone with the means pull some numbers together to see if this hypothesis holds water?

Also, see you on the moon everyone! :)",2021-01-16 14:20:44

Why $BB will moon 🚀,0.92,"So I have been doing some research into institutional money moving in and out of $BB and you Retards are going to love my findings. 

The last large institutional sell off occurred in March of 2020. A ton of five star Morningstar rated funds sold off millions of shares, I’m talking 7-8 million dollars worth per fund. 

The last large institutional buy was Dec. 31st. Multiple three star funds bought up hundreds of thousands of dollars worth in $BB. This tells us that institutional money is betting on a strong 2021. All the funds that sold in March paper handed their shares and could get FOMO if the stock continues to hold above $9. 

$BB is not even in the first 20 pages of the list of the “most shorted stocks” in the market... GME is number 1 and look what is happening. 

Morningstar and CFRA both put $BB with a fair value price of 6.40, so you can assume that is the absolute bottom. 

The CEO formerly was the head of a software company that was on the brink of bankruptcy that he restructured, brought back to profitability, then sold to SAP for 5.8 billion dollars. 

Biden Administration is pushing for a huge cyber security restructuring in light of the Solar Winds hack. $BB already does contract work for the US Air Force. 

This is a long term play. But the prospects of future profitability are incredibly high. Hold the line gentlemen.

"GME Squeeze, was this it?? (DD & comparison)",0.93,"Barrons [wrote an article](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-stock-doubled-last-weekbut-challenges-remain-51610751952) that the GME squeeze has happened, and hedge funds lost 1 billion and that is it. 

What I read out of this article is desperation. Their daddies, the very hedge funds that are betting against us Wallstreetbettors, obviously push those news, place them like paid for PR. Something a lot of people have to understand, is that that is all a very normal way of playing the game. **Fake news!** Don't believe anything someone with opposite interests than yours says. 

The fact of the matter is, the net short position has increased by around 2% yesterday. They throw even more money after their bad money to recoup their losses.
The spike was caused by more and more retail and institutional investors realising this is actually going to happen and buying in.

For a lot of people (like Burry, Mashaal, cohen obviously and others) this is an opportunity. Institutions like blackrock or Senvest are buying in to take the money of the melvins of this world.

Let's compare this to other famous short squeezes: [VW Squeeze](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Nr8vkBriAuo/U0RSt0E3_1I/AAAAAAAAAs0/fDcm_9XTzI0/s1600/volkswagen.gif)

Where are we at? either in June or September! 

The actual panic, the grappling, the desperation, the higher bidding, the margin calls, all that hasn't even started yet!

I'm not suggesting that this will a couple months to play out, nowadays things move faster, but it will happen soonish.

Is the GME situation similar to the VW 2008 situation??,0.86,"So I brought the dip yesterday after doing some research but I want to discuss whether the VW MOASS is really a valid comparison to what we are seeing now with GME.  Obviously, I see the potential for gains here, but I’m questioning the comparison to a short squeeze that made a struggling company the most valuable one in the world for a few days. 

I’ve seen the GME situation compared quite a bit to the VW Mother of all Short Squeezes. One of the major differences I see is that in 2008, Porsche owned 74% of the public float and Lower Saxony owned another 20%.  

In this situation, you had two entities controlling 94% of the available shares. 


In GME, while the stock is heavily shorted, there are far more shares held by far more people, companies, and hedge funds who own tons of shares (compared to my 200) that can be dumped at any time as short sellers need to cover their positions. 

So with this in mind, does wsb really think this is comparable to the MOASS?  If so, why? What am I missing.",2021-01-16 13:31:53
GME - Directors also seem to believe there is more upside to the current stock prize. With good reason! Don't let the shorts shake you out 🚀🚀,0.93,"See the SEC information on insider trading for GME here: https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1326380.htm

In addition to James Wolf apparently being forced to sell a portion of his GME Holdings for his funds risk balancing purposes, three other GME Directors have also sold a PORTION of their shares in the last days. 

Please notice how each of them has only sold around half of their current holdings, with Mrs. Dunn only selling roughly 8% (she is the smartest of the bunch I guess). 

Now ask yourself, why would these GME directors not just sell of all of their shares in GME after such an explosive rise in the stock's prize? 

BECAUSE 1) THEY ARE IN THE KNOW OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS TO COME  and 2) THEY BELIEVE MORE UPWARDS MOVEMENT WILL COME. 

Surely it makes sense for them to cash out a portion after such a run up, they would even be fools not to do so. However they must be aware of the short squeeze phenomenon, as well as have some insider knowledge as to the development and the future/potential of the company. If these people are willing to keep holding most of their shares in GME, THEN SO SHOULD YOU.

Palantir Technologies ($PLTR) has some MAJOR catalyst approaching. Don’t miss out like you did with $GME,0.9,"Yesterday we ended the day on a 3% gain, albeit this was a 10%+ gain at some points but the market went red as a whole so this is understandable. Regardless, there’s a number of reasons to be loading up on SHARES before the 🚀 takes off.

1. Institutional’s are loading up on PLTR prior to the major catalysts (ARK recently upped their stake by 497,100 shares and so did another number of firms).

2. Demo Day: 26th of Jan we’ll see PLTR do a demonstration day of their main product offerings. This will undoubtedly draw attention and traction to the stock as people better understand the recent standardisation of PLTR’s software. This standardisation is what has enabled them to target over 6,000 large institution/enterprise customers across all verticals. Ultimately this will show their commercial viability outside of what they’re known for (governmental contracts) and will result in a stock uptick due to their future viability.

3. Earnings Day: Early February we shall see PLTR’s earnings report for Q420. This should also cover some of the forward-looking aspects of it’s recently acquired contracts alongside projections. If you are unaware of those contracts, see the link here: [LINK](https://investors.palantir.com/home/default.aspx)

As Palantir will most likely pass $1bn in revenue, this is likely to be a big day.


4. Lockup period: Employees and the like are able to liquidate some of their positions come mid February. This has obvious negative connotations to it but for the most part what most people don’t understand is that there will only be a minuscule amount of shares which will be CASHED in. Employees will not cash in all their shares as they will also notice and realise the growth potential of their stock options. They will maybe cash in a small amount if needed but the firm has just began properly marketing their product and concentrating on business development, employees and us alike know the growth potential of this stock.

Once a lower-than-anticipated amount of stock is liquidated, this will most likely have an inverse effect. People will realise that this dip won’t happen and there will be a scrambled influx to buy in. Most likely driving the stock up and pushing it to ATH (unless we have another Citi downgrade bcos IBs love a bit of MM).


That’s all.

I did an original post about this position but it was taken down for some reason - sorry. 

Original theory: Pretty simple, the short interest in this stock is huge (63% and 26 days to cover). After the GME fiasco, I'm betting that it's only a matter of time before some rogue hedge fund starts to get behind this thing and instigates a short squeeze. I want to be along for the ride, and if it's anything like GME I'm gonna make bank🚀🚀 

If FIZZ gets squeezed to a 50% gain I'll be looking at a $60k position, and a 100% gain would net $176k. I'm expecting $100k+ with any luck.

PSA: Do NOT buy GME on margin,0.96,"First: 🚀🚀🚀

Now, on to the business at hand.

A lot of you are making the correct choice in buying shares at this point in the game while waiting for the short squeeze - which could be coming as soon as Tuesday now that SEC Rule 201 is in play. 

But some of you are extra greedy/retarded and are buying GME ***on margin***

I'm here to tell you that you are potentially fucking over the short squeeze by doing so. 

**If ""Fidelity and Schwab are confirmed to have eliminated margin"" it means all the traders that bought on margin will get a MARGIN CALL and be forced to either liquidate their positions or add more funds.**

That means the 100,000 shares you bought on margin are going to be forcibly liquidated when you can't cover the actual cost of getting them. 

**This will force prices down.**

And I know for a fact that most of you have zero porfolio diversity to liquidate, especially retards who are buying GME shares on margin. 

**tl;dr:** If you're buying GME shares, you want to buy with cash on hand and nothing more

Alternatively, buy LEAPs with as high strike as possible - follow u/deepfuckingvalue and hop on mid-April calls

Finally: 🚀🚀🚀

Obligatory I'm long on GME and do not plan on opening more positions if the SEC ever peeks in here.

The GME wild card: Robinhood,0.9,"I don't want to bring the mood down, but I want you boys who play with the confetti to sober the hell up for a moment.

Real brokers are already bailing out of supplying fuel to this dumpster fire and are likely setting up prepared strategies for how to handle their share of these positions during each phase.

I imagine administration over at Robinhood is too busy selling all of your GME trading data to Melvin to even think about how they're going to sell all of your shares. Their features actively make it worse. Sure, being able to put in ridiculous limit-sell orders is fun. We're mad that Fidelity won't let us do it. But can you even imagine the absurdity of different fills that need to be executed during an event like this? Fills that we need to be quick and precise, and fills that the broker needs to execute well to protect themselves and their customers.

Robinhood doesn't give a single spiced crouton of shit about any of you, and they rarely seem to care about their own future as a company. Their fills are always last in line, and that's assuming the app will even be useable. They have people eating ass during every huge market moment, and they WILL fuck this up, too. At least there isn't a time change...and at least there should be multiple opportunities.

Seriously think about moving your GME positions into a real brokerage. There's still time, and it would probably even be a positive catalyst for the stock if everyone did it.

I don't have the time or the knowledge, but I feel like there needs to be large discussion on how Marginhood has helped create this glorious moment...and how they will also help destroy it.

I want this to get y'all out of the ghetto, not having you unable to even afford a lawyer to sue Robinhood.

GME Margin Requirement & Margin Call Explanation For Noobs,0.96,"I have seen lot's of question on  Margin Requirements and  confusion  surrounding  it and wanted to clarify it as lot's of information is wrong.  

Margin Requirements effect's both longs and shorts. It effects longs only if shares have been bought on margin and the account is overleveraged, like a true retard like me.  I think because of this lot of shares were also sold today, because the brokerage forced selling.  

Whats an Margin Account ?  (Info From Fidelity) 

A margin account lets you leverage securities you already own as collateral for a loan to buy additional securities. 

What's a Margin Requirement 

Margin requirements tell you how much equity you must have in your account to cover what you’re buying (or what you hold) on margin. The requirements are determined 

1. Federal Requirement . Default Value is 50 percent . Means for 10k account I can only leverage 5k more. For a total account of 15k.  
2. Exchange Requirement . Exchange Requirement is 25 percent 
3. Broker Requirement.   Ranges from 30-100 percent 

I will explain this using my Margin Account.    Below is the my margin  account and the house call which I almost got fucked with. Had to deposit 27k to cover it. 

&#x200B;

[My Margin Account as of 1\/16\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/o3g6us2tsmb61.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b6bb9ff56625dca063860c3f741f7647f47428c)

&#x200B;

On 1/14/2021 the requirement for GME on Fidelity was 40 percent.  

  

|Number Of Shares|Total Value |Requirement Amount (40%)|Leverage Amount|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|3000|51,000|20,4000|30,600|

Like I true retard I used this 30,600 to buy other shares in the above screenshot.  I bought PLTR, GOEV etc.   

On 1/15/2021 the requirement for GME on Fidelity was changed to 65 percent.  Suddenly the leverage amount dropped for me from 30k to 17k.  Creating a short fall of 12.5k . As I was leveraged to tits I got a email from fidelity regarding this.  I got saved by rising GME price. 

&#x200B;

|Number Of Shares|Total Value |Requirement Amount (65%)|Leverage Amount|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|3000|51,000|33,150|17,850|

&#x200B;

[1\/14](https://preview.redd.it/0wxo93d2vmb61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=c271ec4efdcb11e3fbf25c28b257bf6860570289)

  

Thankfully price of GME rose from 20 to 31 which increased my total account value and helped in avoiding margin call.  

&#x200B;

On 1/15/2021 Fidelity and others increase there margin requirement to 85 percent or 100 percent in case of schawb. Suddenly all longs holding shares in margin account and tits leveraged and shorts are fucked.   I was suddenly down 17,850-7650 =10,200k. I got a house call/margin call.  As 1/15 was a bear day and my other stocks lost money suddenly I was in red of 23k. 

&#x200B;

|Number Of Shares|Total Value |Requirement Amount (65%)|Leverage Amount|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|3000|51,000|43,350|7650|

 In case of Margin call people have two options to either deposit $ or sell securities. 

I am depositing 27k to cover this shortfall if not I would sell some GOEV and NVAX to cover the shortfall.  In short people have opportunity to cover there margin call and the account is liquidated only when the call is not met or the broker decides the trade is retarded and sell it himself.  

&#x200B;

TLDR : Margin Requirement will cause both long and short to cover and it will also cause some longs who are leveraged to tits to sell the stocks.   This will effect shorts more as they are even more fucked than a long.

Ryan Cohen is all in on GME. From the jump, he has been committed to turning Gamestop into the Amazon of games. He has a throbbing raging hard on to blow GME to the fucking moon. He shitposts on his Twitter about Blockbuster and Jim Cramer. GME is forcing T-rex dinosaur looking wrinkly tapioca pudding eating old fucks off the board. RC is a fellow autist.

But more importantly boys: He's a fucking billionaire. He bought 550 Million dollars of Tesla last year.

GME has 71 Million shares and Papa Cohen can exercise purchase of 7% to up his ownership. That's roughly 5 million shares. 5 Million X $36 is 180 Million. Why would he not spend 1/3 of what he spent on tesla on his own vision? Why the FUCK would Papa Cohen not suck up the rest of his entitled shares to throw green dildos at the shorts. He's an activist and believes in the mission. He can afford it.

BED BATH TO THE 🌕 AND BEYOND 🚀🚀🚀,0.86,"Hey, it's your OG BBBY bull. Since people asked, here's a deeper dive into why I'm bullish on BBBY.

TLDR AND POSITIONS AT THE BOTTOM

# Overview

Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries is an omnichannel retailer that sells a wide assortment of merchandise in the Home, Baby, Beauty and Wellness markets. It's subsidaries include Buy Buy Baby, Face Values, and Decoris.

# Leadership

* **Mark Tritton - CEO (ex target vice president and chief marketing officer)**
   * **COMPLETELY turned around Target into what it is today**
      * Launched **40 successful private label brands**
      * **Transformed** their digital market
      * Remodeled **850 stores**
      * Lead to **6 consecutive** quarters of growth at target
   * **He plans to do the same at BBBY and this becomes clear in the 3 year turnaround plan**
* **Rafeh Masoor**
   * Far less known, but very innovative from a digital standpoint
      * ""Top 10 movers and shakers in retail""
   * Strong results at BJ's wholesale club
   * He brings a strong 3 pronged approach to the digital scene
      * digital first mindset with a BOPIS and free delivery
      * virtual rooms and improved ui to elevate customer experience
      * develop omni capabilities

# Turnaround Plan

* **Deepen Relations With Customers**
   * Retain and grow their **INCREASING** customer base with incentives and marketing
   * **Focus on their 5 segments in marketing**
      * the juggler, the innovator, the nester, the creative, and the minimizer
   * create **loyalty progams** to increase retention
* **Resetting Product Assortment**
   * Releasing BBBY's unique **private label brands** to penetrate the market and raise margin
   * increase the range of prices on products to invite lower spenders to the store
   * creating ""destination rooms"" to **elevate customer experience**
* **Offer competitive pricing**
   * BBBY wants to remain competitive in pricing while filling price gaps between products
   * **Study promotional data** to **maximize return** on coupons
* **Omnichannel**
   * Integrate physical locations with the digital setting
      * BOPIS (buy online pickup in store)
   * This will allow customers to venture into physical locations as well
* **Remodeling**
   * As stated earlier BBBY wants to **create customer friendly stores**
   * Currently, BBBY's stores look like ugly department stores and things are unaccessible
   * They are remodeling **450 stores over 3 years**
      * **the remodels are exactly what I wanted to see**
* **Creating stronger technology platform**
   * Better app and better website = more digital sales

As a BBBY shopper, **this addresses ALL my issues with the stores** atm.

As an investor, it's clear that **BBBY knows their audience and how they can regain market share and capitalize on their customers.**

Tritton clearly has a **GREAT vision** and **knows what he needs to do to** make it a reality.

REMEMBER this is a 3 year long plan, which means it will take time to fully come to fruition.

**If this is successful, BBBY will be a leader in the industry and the stock will reach highs unseen for years. With the leadership, I expect BBBY to successfully execute this plan, constantly top expectations, and prove the shorters wrong.**

# Q3 Financials

* **Profitability**
   * Profit margin is at a **historically high level of 35%**
      * **10% increase YoY** lead by lowered payroll, improved promo management, and product mix
   * SG&A **lowered** by 41 million
* **Cash Flow and EBITDA**
   * **Cash flow of 244 million** compared to a **negative** cash flow last year
   * EBITDA **growth of 168% from -.38 cents to .08 cents**
* **Comp and digital Sales**
   * For the first time in 6 years, BBBY is showing comparable sales growth in the last 2 quarters
   * **Digital sales up 94%**
   * In store traffic **decreasing**
* **Market Share**
   * For the first time in ages, BBBY saw market shares growth in the Home and kitchen departments
   * Reversal of a negative trend in other departments
* **Cash and Debt**
   * Cash is increasing to a solid 1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents
   * debt lowered by 500 million (25%) this year
* **Revenue and Net income**
   * Revenue is DECREASING by 5% YoY
      * Tritton closed TONS of low performing stores and will continue to do so
      * also sold failing businesses
      * this will hurt total revenue but raise net income
   * Net Income is INCREASING
      * lower performing stores gone means higher profits

Yes, earnings missed estimates, but as Tritton said, **he is doing everything he said he would do.**

**The balance sheet is improving, he is executing his plan steadily, and he is overall reassuring investors with his buybacks.**

BBBY is focusing on optimizing their top performing stores as the country is over satured with stores currently. With unprofitable stores closing, **we can expect a decreasing overall revenue, but an increasing net income.**

As the plan continues, I fully expect overall revenue to **reverse the trend, and begin increasing.**

Investors were also disappointed with guidance, but **Tritton has mentioned that he is being CONSERVATIVE in estimates**. He has always one to be conservative and deliver more than expected.

# Tailwinds

* **Growing customer base**
* A general **shift towards home improvement**
* **New private label brands** are profitable and would help gain market share in 2021
* **150 stores** being remodeled in 2021
* **Stimulus** and perhaps more from Biden
* Return to ""normal"" would lead to a **large surge in marriages and babies**

# Headwinds

* COVID worsening and restrictions returning
* **Twitter trying to get BBBY cancelled for selling MyPillow**

# Buybacks

Normally, I am against share buybacks. BBBY used them previously to suppport a dying stock, but here it's different.

BBBY currently has an accelerated share repurchase program of 850  million dollars with 150 million to be repurchased by february 29th.

With excess cash from selling unprofitable businesses, **Tritton seeks to regain investor confidence WHILE producing obvious changes and results.**

Due to these buybacks, I expect share prices to grow over the next few months leading up to earnings.

# Short Interest

Currently, short interest is astronomically high at \~70%. I believe that this has decreased as a hedge fund bearish on GME and BBBY seems to have covered at the same time.

Check the spike on GME and BBBY 1/13 11:30. It's likely Melvin or mapleridge covered a short position.

With Cramer pumping and this, we saw a mild squeeze, **but there are no more catalysts to cause another for a while;** however, with buybacks and strong performance, shorters will slowly buy back their shares alongside BBBY, causing **a steady rise in price in the following months.**

**If the turnaround plan is successful, shorts will have no reason to remain bearish, and BBBY will grow exponentially in price over the next 6-12 months.**

# Conclusion

**Bed Bath and Beyond is on the road to success.**

**As a consumer, their private label brands, store remodels, and specialized marketing changes are exactly what I want to see.**

**In a growing industry, strong leadership, buybacks, and a beautiful turnaround plan make me bullish on BBBY.**

**I do NOT expect growth akin to what happened this week, but expect strong growth as the sentiment towards BBBY changes and their plan succeeds over the next few months.**

# I am bullish on BBBY and will be until Tritton leaves

# TLDR

Tritton will take us to the moon. Calls for the brave (dated far out), shares for the weak.

Great leadership, good plan, good industry 🚀🚀🚀🚀🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚

It's time to prepeare for PALANTIR ($PLTR) 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 (indepth),0.94,"While I've been participating with $GME (LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTION!) and getting aboard the $BB train to the MOON  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

I think that it's time to slowly invest into or continually investing for pure GAINS

We know that Cathie Wood's ARK Next Generation Internet ETF bought 497,100 shares of Palantir.

link: [https://www.thestreet.com/investing/palantir-pltr-stock-ark-next-generation-internet-etf](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/palantir-pltr-stock-ark-next-generation-internet-etf)

&#x200B;

With Palantir opening a contract with the military and the government we can see that Woods is trying to invest more of the company into her Index ETF

&#x200B;

So what makes you think that Palantir stocks will go up fairly soon? 3 catalysts

1. **Announced in Dec. 17th Demonstration Day (link provided) ON JANURAY 26TH**

Will be showing off their AI Software; Gotham, Foundry, Apollo

[https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Announces-Inaugural-Live-Demo-Day-on-January-26-2021/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Announces-Inaugural-Live-Demo-Day-on-January-26-2021/default.aspx)  we'll see  what they have to offer which should beef up their stock for a bit

&#x200B;

2.**Palantir will be announcing their Q4 Earnings date around FEB 11th** 

which should show how well they're doing

&#x200B;

3. **There is a share lock-up** (meaning that a lot 60-80% of their shares are owned by insiders, CEOs, employees, etc) which means that we'll see that ends probably around mid-February where we can see a giant dip due to those people selling their shares for the profits they've seen from the market

&#x200B;

However, after that happens I do believe that the prices will float back up by March/April

&#x200B;

Watch this video if you didn't understand

&#x200B;

Prediction; pick up Palantir stocks and watch them go up before/after their demonstration I would say prepare calls around (27.5 - 29c)  for the week of 29TH  and around Feb 11th.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Once the lockup period happens I'm sure we'll see some dips and that'll be more chances to buy into the dip as well as redo more options

There's another reason we can 💎 🙌 other than our massive 🍒. [GME],0.97,"Hello fellow retards. It's been quite the ride watching our collective cognitive dysfunction butt blast Smelvin Capital. And it's going to feel even better when we finish inside them as well. Something though that I want to bring up since it's being asked a lot especially by our newly self-diagnosed autists, and that is although this thing is on the verge of exploding any day now, the ball is FUNDAMENTALLY in our court. When people ask you not to be a single-ply handed bitch and to dump your grandparents' retirement accounts into more shares, they're not doing it because they want to pump themselves. It's because there is no running cost to owning a share. Obviously there is potential downside and opportunity loss from other tasty FDs (even though, who are we kidding? this sub has probably had the highest return rate ever this week with everyone not gifting away their money to thetagang). But on the short's side there's a short lending premium, which because of the damage our relentless banging of our heads against the wall has caused, has recently exploded and is probably the reason why some risk dude at Melvin who doesn't even hang out with his wife's boyfriend is drinking himself to sleep every night. 


The only thing these evil fucks have is deep pockets. And they will use every penny they have to scare us, thinking all these extra shorts will eventually come back to them. But what they don't know is that there are more zeroes in our collective negative IQ than there are in their accounts. So no matter what happens, I want to see AN ABSOLITE GORILLA APE LEVEL OF DIAMOND HANDED RETARDATION from you because if you're holding shares YOU LITERALLY HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE compared to them (especially that this is a good LONG hold anyways with RC for the next year or two minimum).



Here's some shit they're throwing at us so let's sling some right back at them.

* Buy shares in cash if you can not on margin to minimize lending potential and even the very unlikely margin calling when shit hits the fan.

* Set up sky high limit sell stops which also can deter your cuck broker from lending your shares out. 

* I want the only time you even look at the sell button is if because of all the digits now in your position, the buy button has been PUSHED OFF YOUR SCREEN.

* If you ever feel your appendages start to feel itchy and papyraceous, realize that any natural catalysts like good news from RC or any retarded organic bullish sentiments would blast this gasoline truck out of the atmosphere.

TLDR: You're being asked to carry a school bag sitting in chair and just to outlast the biggest asshole you've known in you're life who found himself strapped with weights running up a mountain instead of what he thought would be downhill stroll at the expense of working class people.

Unusual Options Activity 101: Whale Watching Tips,0.98,"This is long, if you’re uninterested skip to the ten tips list or TLDR

A while ago I started mixing unusual options activity into my ~~gambling~~investing.  At first I lost a shitload of money chasing dumbass whales with zero plan, but now I actually have a pretty good feel for it.  I still fuck up alot, but more often I do not fuck up.  This is to help those of you who want to start chasing whales, or are at a basic level and want to do it better.

I'm using some plays from this week as examples because they are fresh in my mind and I have a couple screenshots.

**Tools**
I use barchart in tandem with Unusual Whales. For barchart, you can honestly get by using their free version, you just can't sort as well.  They have a free month trial too.  I also pay the 20 bucks for Unusual Whales to confirm what I scan, and they have a good stocks volume standard deviation tool.  I have zero affiliation to either, just saying what I use.

There are way more technical ways to do this, but I like to use my eyes to scan sporadically throughout the day like a boomer.

**Basic Concept**
Long story short, you're ideally chasing the options purchases of what are, presumably, deep-pocketed individuals or institutions.  UOA identifies certain options contract orders that are higher than the average daily contract order.  For example, if the average daily option volume on an GME weekly is 4,000, and an option order enters for 4,000 or higher, it's flagged as unusual activity since it's a multiple of that daily average volume--sometimes it shows as multiple orders if ""they"" push through a few smaller purchases that produce heavy volume.

MM are sneks who like to move in silence, which they can do with with stock positions via dark pools and the like.  However, they can't get away with that with options activity--it all shows.  That fact, young autist, is your slingshot against the institutional goliath.

**Hunting the Whale**
So I've got my unusual options activity page open on barchart or wherever for the current day.  I adjust the expiration date option so that the options I'm looking at don't expire past a couple weeks out (more on why later), then I'm ready to eye scan.

I typically start by looking for **one of two things: 1) large clusters of orders that belong to one ticker  or 2) sporadic orders for a ticker that consistently show up over a couple hours, but belong to non-hot, non-meme stonks that do NOT have earnings imminent.**  To make sure I'm looking at something potentially weird, I choose to exclude options that expire more than a couple weeks out.

**1) Clusters of orders—ABNB example**
The way I scope it is kind of a tiered process.  *First*, I'm looking to see if there are any clusters of orders that catch my eye on a quick scan.  *Second*, I'm looking to see if those clusters of orders contain both calls AND puts, with some OTM activity and spreads preferred.  *Third*, I look to see if the number of seperate call orders outweighs the number of put orders (or vice versa), and additionally I look to see if the volume of the calls drastically outweighs the volume of the puts (or vice versa).  

**Why?  Because it helps you determine if the options order is just a hedge, or if it’s hedging against itself as it’s own positio**n. This is super important so try to follow along-- most UOA is just institutions hedging; Mr. MM has a nice, busy life and fancy yacht and can't just exit his positions back and forth all day like a WSBer.  He also has like a billion shares of his stonks, so if he dumps it when he's got paper hands it will siginficantly tank the value and cause a ripple effect.  So, *instead* of hedging by dumping his shit, he hedges by adding OTM options against his position--next level fucking diamond hands.  That would be the type of whale order from Mr. MM we don't want to follow.  *But*, if Mr. MM buys 4,000 FB call options in a few blocks, and you see like 1,000 in FB puts go through right alongside it, the odds are that someone is betting big on FB and using the puts as a hedge, since the puts represent a smaller volume in the call/put ratio.  Instead of the options being a hedge for a bigger stock position they hold, these types of option clusters indicate that the option order itself is the big, independent play, and it's hedging itself with lower volume order vs the higher volume (4,000 calls to 1,000 puts).

**Then I do an easy confirmation**.  I check the tickers general trend the past week or so in a chart, do a news search on twitter of their ticker for news catalysts and sentiment, and google and YouTube to see if the crayola kids think it's a good nerd play.

**Example**: Here's the screenshot on some ABNB UOA I noticed and played this week.  It went to 200% and change within a couple hours, but I had unfortunate diamond hands and sold for about half that.

[ABNB UOA](https://i.imgur.com/mYDXYmN.jpg)

So, this a softball.  **First**, you can see that ABNB all of a sudden explodes with all these options showing up at 12:52–that's our cluster.  **Second**, the clusters have both calls and puts in that minute timespan, with some put orders showing at the bottom of the cluster.  Some of the calls are deep OTM, as far as 200c.  **Third**, the call orders far outweigh the put orders in both amount and volume.  *Awwwww shit, looks like we got more than a hedge—we’re onto something.*

**Confirmation time**: ABNB had been on a general uptrend, and I typically don't like to chase, but I combed twitter and saw their were rumors of the CEO speaking the following day, and that news had just broken of their DC booking cancellations.  I looked back into the morning, and saw a few more unusual blocks, and a few more rolled in just after the cluster pictured above.

Passed the smell test.  Options bought, tendies gained.

**Sparse Orders: SNAP example**

The same principles can apply to orders on tickers that pop up individual orders, not large clusters,  which **a) haven’t had much attention b) have been on a steep downtrend—this makes the order unusual, and/or c) seem to keep popping up in single orders over a few hours to a day.**The same principles as above apply, but if you see these types of orders with very little time left until expiration, you can assume assume it's probably not a hedge.  SNAP isn't the best example of the week because there wasn't a put order in this block.  But, there was positive TA sentiment when I searched, SNAP had been on an oversold downtrend, and I don't have screenshots left of the better ones I saw and went after.  **Plus, importantly, IT WAS TOWARDS THE END OF THE DAY** (this is huge, EOD is prime time for AH news whales)

[SNAP UOA](https://i.imgur.com/GGr5bra.jpg)

A better example from this week though is SPCE, which had only a few orders sprinkled throughout the day, and one toward the end of the day which was DEEP, DEEP OTM expiring 1/15.  **That’s a flag for us—sporadic listing throughout the day, OTM toward the end of the day. ** BAM! EOD SPCE OTM calls sprinkle in, ARK invests to kick off AH, SPCE moons. 

**Sparse Orders Patterns: Connecting the dots on tech rebound with FB and SNAP**

Seeing the SNAP orders above sharpened my eyes that day to looking for a pattern with tech on the whole, since big tech had been so royally gaped the past week.  I kept seeing FB options like this pop up

[https://i.imgur.com/muVGtq2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/T54peER.jpg)

Sometimes you can put together sporadic listings and create a working theory based on a sector.  Because this and similar FB orders were deep OTM and one day out, I knew there was a risk they could a hedge, but also knew that the tech sector was due for a rebound and saw SNAP posting sporadic OTM as well.  **So, I bought my options for each of those two another week out and closer to ATM (important, more below), to give the whale some breathing room** in case was it was a hedge, even though the technicals agreed with the bounce.  The whales were right, and it was an easy little overnight profit.


**How I’ve Fucked Up 1: Don’t get tricked by trends**

Although we like to believe institutions are ahead of the curve, often they are just trend-riding lemmings who follow what's already way, way up.  They buy the top, just like WSB tardies such as yourself specialize in.  So, when you see shit like this below, take a minute to think before you get excited:

It was the same for all the memes: PLUG, FCEL, MARA, and RIOT all week, dominating the orders.  If something is already too popular, just stay away from it.  You can ride something up, but when you see massive orders on shit that's already like 400% IV, just...don't.

**How I’ve Fucked Up 2: DO give the MM’s some breathing room**

*Even if you’re confident in a move you see that is a few days out, extend your play a week or two further out minimum, and strike it closer to ATM.*  If you can't do either of those things because you can't afford the premium just skip that play and check back for something new later; I promise a better opportunity will arise.  You can recover from bagholding, but you cannot recover from blowing your account on an incorrect 0DTE.

Breathing room is also important because often whales will have the news but not the exact timing.  Two months ago I followed a DDOG whale on a Thursday 1DTE that expired worthless the next day.  The following Monday (1 trade day later) DDOG made the announcement that rocketed them like 20%--if I'd given them a week's breathing room, it would've been a 15 bagger.  Fucking F.

**So, to review:** look for order clusters or sporadic ticker orders that a) have a mix of calls and puts with one dominating the other b) unpopular tickers that have deep OTM or close expirations c) always check chatter afterward and fundamentals and d) try to put together a narrative of things that are related that catch your eye (this Monday's EV run or this Friday's tech bounce could be next week's airline dominance or cruiseline craze--connect the dots).  Initially look for options expiring soon, as they indicate the most riskiness--and therefore confidence--if the MM is not hedging.  Shop with a short term eye, buy with a long term choice. 

**10 Things That Will Help You Not GUH:**

**1)** Monday and Friday morning/afternoon are the most accurate whale times, according to data from Unusual Whales

**2)** If you don't have PDT always save some spending power for EOD shopping

**3**) If you don't have PDT never, ever follow a whale with a weekly.  Sometimes the news the whale bets on is a 'sell the news' event, and you won’t recover from a drop especially if there is IV crush involved. 

**4)** Always give the whale breathing room by purchasing an expiration at least a week further out

**4b**) Always give the whale breathing room by going closer to ATM strikes than theirs

**5)** Sign up for barchart monthly trial (then continue it) and unusual whales--they're each like 20 bucks and thats way less than you spend on an FD. 

**6**) You don't need to learn TA, but you need to check technicals on the tickers you want to chase--almost every major ticker has youtubers or fintwits giving their daily or weekly TA.  This way you know if it's a proper breakout happening if the whale hits, and you're not just guessing at when to take profits.  Remember, whales can buy wayyyyyyy OTM and sell for massive profit at any point--they *aren’t* bagholding a call until it's in the money like you are. You may be 10% up waiting for the next 80% GME day while your whale has sold at their target 5% profits on the play and is chillin. 

**7**) Leave at least 10% of your account spending power free each day.  I promise, the one time you go full boat you will see the most obvious whale play at the end of the day.  Then you won't be able to do shit about it and you'll hate yourself when it's a 10 bagger overnight.  Trust me.

**8**) Make sure the ticker you're chasing isn't just ER anticipation/bets.  Always check earnings dates before buying.

**9**) Remember whales are people, so they can be stupid, too.  Don't baghold a position that is clearly fucked for some news that looks unlikely to come.  They are gambling addicts just like you, except they have more money.

**10**) Always take profits if you ask yourself if it's time to.  If it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to close the position.

**Positions**:

WKHSc
PLTRc
SPYc (1/19, 1/22)
LMNDp

And a couple tickers that I couldn’t post lol.  also have AAPL and JD leaps

***

TLDR
Use a service to follow whales so you can get ahead of announcements.  Look for clusters of options activity that hedge themselves via call/put ratio, and do a legitimate check for TA and catalysts to confirm their moves.  Never follow a whale into a weekly, but use weeklies are your best screener.

***

*I might do a pretty consistent DD post (a couple times a week) on what I’m seeing at the end of each day if there is interest, and if it’s not a day I don’t have a ton of real work.

GME 💎🙌🏿 🚀🚀🚀✅ Thanks WSB,0.87,,2021-01-16 01:17:00
Some observations on WSB and the future of trading,0.98,"Hello autists. I'm sitting here in my retard palace reflecting on how my idea of the market has changed since I dove into this sub right around the beginning of last year. I first visited WSB a couple years ago but was quickly overwhelmed with all the abbreviations and inside jokes. At the time I dismissed it as a nihilistic financial-prank hellhole where people with nothing to lose YOLO'd their money away and that it was encouraged and that everyone was just trying to throw away their money. While that does happen obviously, I think there's a much bigger macro-vision of this sub that is changing things forever in the market.

In my opinion, nothing demonstrates this macro-vision better than the narrative surrounding GME. To have a talking head that my dad would watch when I was a kid continue to reference this sub on TV and say that we're in control is insane. At the same time, this exposure could be a death sentence. We are in a precarious situation now where the volume of users here really makes us a stupidly strong retail entity if we all choose to rally behind something. It's cool, but it's also a liability. The number of braindead questions that have flooded the daily threads since the GME rally began has been immense, and that's only counting the comments that made it through whatever automatic filters the mods set up here. Because of this volume, it's going to increase our exposure to the media exponentially. There have already been tons of articles written about WSB, but none of them have gotten to the point of putting on the blame for something financially devastating. With the influence we have over the market (at least when there's an agreed upon general sentiment here) it's only a matter of time until we upset the wrong suit on Wall Street and they try to see what they can do to fuck up the operation here.

I hope it doesn't come to that because I really do think the camaraderie here is something special. On first visit it seemed like a mean, uninviting place, but what I've realized is that people do look out for each other here. When someone does something 'retarded' like take every cent to their name and put it into weeklies, they get called retarded (because they are), but they'll also get comments like 'no one has ever lost money taking a profit' when it's time to go. There's a bond over degenerate lack-of-financial-responsibility, but it's all in the name of pursuing financial independence in a brute-force manner and attempting to stand up to a system that has never shown much care for those not deemed worthy to be a part of it.

I know there's a flip side to all of this. There's the idea of gambling addiction, the idea that you see a lot more people post about their wins than losses, confirmation bias, and that a lot of people won't make it out the other end with a profit, but that goes for most systems in life. It still feels great to see someone here find the life they never thought they could have, buy that car, provide for that family member, etc. And maybe it doesn't last or they test their luck and lose their gains, but no one ever said we weren't retarded.

Point is...All eyes are on us, especially after all the TSLA gains last year. We will see how the GME chapter unfolds this year, but it is undeniable that the media exposure and influence this sub holds is only going to increase, and with that there's a lot to consider amongst ourselves as to what the primary tone and function of this space is. To not anticipate hordes of normies and suited wall-streeters continuing to infiltrate the space is to underestimate the growth that will take place whether we want it to or not. I believe, when we look back on it in the future, that this chapter of WSB began last year around the crash in March, but there's no denying it's a new chapter nonetheless. It's only gonna get crazier.

They are one of the best bang for your buck companies in the sector. 3.5b in revenue and the market cap is only 3b with a p/e of 15. Market cap at 1 times revenue!!! Like seriously wtf is that.   

Biden is going to invest in environmental, social and governance sector which means there will be a huge payout for solar. Tax creds and tariff reductions baby. CSIQ already announced US largest PV and battery storage without a peep from the market. Methinks it’s cuz everyone on SPWR FSLR RUN and whatever other solar company with p/e 40+’s nuts. Fuck those guys  

And people be like “Canadian solar is actually backed by China and has no exposure to US”. To those people I say fucky fuckity fuck you duck. CSIQ is a global company with a subsidiary called Recurrent Energy which just sold a huge project in Cali.

Along with that, people been bankin on EV and that bubble bout to bust. However people still want a hand in clean energy or just green renewable companies in general. My guess is that these autists will rotate over to the solar sector which due for a massive pump like 2015-2016.

2. The real big bucks are flowing towards Palantir with long/short term million dollar contracts.. and ya'll bought BB out of the grave.
3. Citron punched PLTR first, then came Credit Sussie, then Morgan Stanley.... recently Citi... and ya'll had to show them your paper hands. PLTR is a diamond which needs the same. Big guys trying to downplay the stock till the next financials come in. Thats where they get in, and you keep watching the stock price go up. Obvious cue ignored.
4. Just like TSLA is backed by a CEO trying to change world conventions of commuting, energy and space travel. PLTR is the revolution of how corporations would strategize and optimize their existing pipelines! Still ya'll selling shares and buying puts. Obvious cue ignored.
5. Ya'll profited big time out of GME and BB. But, do you really even consider or plan to stay? Doesn't PLTR look like an obvious place to dump your gains?
6. Specifically for you ""simple men"" looking for 🚀- Alex Karp's entire life makes papa Musk's dance look normal.. and ya'll putting your bucks into GME and BB? Isn't Alex Karp's hair style enough for you to YOLO your life savings into PLTR?

Here is a company which is skyrocketing off of skyrocketting other companies and ya'll pumping GME and BB?

Don’t sleep on SPCE,0.82,"GME gang had their fun. BB gang had a lot of FOMO casualties today. F for our fallen comrades. If you missed both or got burned today, do not fret. Look to $SPCE




A few weeks ago, I posted some DD when they were trading at $23 and some retards said it will fall harder to $15. As always, 🏳️‍🌈🧸 get fucked. 




Virgin Galactic has had a rocky past - 15 year company with not much to show for it. But in this past year, we had SPAC rockstar Chamath breath fresh life into the venture. Here is why SPCE will win in 2021. 


1. Public financing is helping the company ramp up their engineering efforts. Their test pilots are certified Air Force badasses. They are ready for take off 🚀🚀🚀🚀





2. Mama Cathy announced a new ARKX space etf which is very likely to hold shares of SPCE. That news alone sent us up 20% and we don’t even have a launch date. 




3. In an interview about his recently passed mother Eve, Sir Richard made an off hand (likely accidental) comment about being proud to fly to space in a ship named after his mother *in the next 2-3 months*



4. Branson is the OG mementrepreneur. He’s been doing this since the 70s and owns an island. When he goes to space with Justin Bieber and Ashton Kutcher, we’ll be in (sub) orbit 🚀🚀🚀🚀



5. The CEO was a top Disney exec. He understands the power of scale and pricing. His goal is to eventually bring prices down to $10,000. So if any of you tards plan on still being alive in 2040 and want to go to space for cheap, it’s in your best interest to support the company




6. “But what about SpaceX!? Elon is king and I want his hot load in my mouth!! Branson is a BOOOOMER!” Ok...SpaceX and VG operate in very different markets. And you all are poor degenerates so it’s not like you can even buy pre-IPO shares anyways. VG is the best play for someone who wants to invest in a company that will bring space to the masses. Also, a Musk-Branson collab is very likely if SPCE takes off. They are not direct competitors and will be huge PR boost to both. That should satisfy all your Elon boners



7. The ticker is literally SPCE, what more DD do you fuckers need? 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🍆💦




Some retards are saying that it is not profitable and will not be able to turn a profit in possibly 10 years. Reminds me of another stonk that people laughed at 10 years ago.

$SRNE to the moon (again) 🚀,0.88,"First-time poster here, but I've been lurking since about September. Y'all brought me tendies in the form of GME and PLTR plays in the past couple months, so I thought it was my turn to repay the favor with some DD on a company that I haven't seen posted about on here yet. This isn’t a short-squeeze opportunity or an ARK darling that’s up 100% in the past year. The play here is Sorrento Therapeutics ($SRNE). SRNE is a biotech company which specializes in researching the use of stem-cells for cancer treatments, as well as non-opiod pain relief treatments. However, if you recognize the name, its more likely due to their developing pipeline of COVID-19 offerings. Since the outbreak began in March, SRNE has applied their resources and existing competencies to developing treatments and testing kits to combat the pandemic. In addition to their ongoing cancer and pain relief projects, they have 11 potential COVID-19 related products in various stages of the pipeline. You can view everything that they are working on here:

[https://sorrentotherapeutics.com/research/pipeline/](https://sorrentotherapeutics.com/research/pipeline/)

Essentially, this company is working on projects to combat cancer, the opioid epidemic, and, oh yeah the global pandemic that has dominated the planet for almost a year now. There is massive demand in all of these areas for new solutions, and Sorrento could be one of the organizations that solves part of the problem. 

Needless to say, SRNE has a lot going on in its labs at the moment. However, each one of these projects represents a potential catalyst for the stock price. For example, the stock jumped almost 200% on May 15th when the company announced that one of their antibody treatments was 100% effective in inhibiting the virus in early testing. (I was holding 450 shares @ 3.15 that I had purchased purely out of excitement for their cancer and pain relief work. I was more than happy to dump them at $10.2 during pre-market on May 18th 😌)

[https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sti-1499-potent-anti-sars-cov-2-antibody-demonstrates-ability](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sti-1499-potent-anti-sars-cov-2-antibody-demonstrates-ability)

Then in August, the share price climbed to a peak of $20, apparently on pure speculation. These two examples demonstrate that this stock has a ton of interest in any news or releases on the COVID front, which arguably isn’t even its main business. The share price has been volatile since August, moving within the $5-12 range over the past 5 months.

**The reason I am writing this post now** is because the stock is up about 20% today, again with no news as of this posting. On December 22nd, the company filed an application for an Emergency Use Authorization for their rapid-test product with the FDA. This is where I think the real money is there to be made. They missed the boat on the vaccine race, but there is still a huge need for improved testing, which in the past has been inefficient and inaccurate. SRNE’s COVI-STIX can reportedly deliver results in 2-15 minutes. With widespread availability of this testing, we could even get back to sporting events and concerts, as testing could be done quickly at the gates of the arena, and any positive cases would be turned away and refunded. SRNE is also working on a rapid spit-test, which would eliminate the need to have a q-tip rammed into your brain.

News on the potential approval of COVI-STIX is imminent, which could further send the stock price higher in the short-term. 20% would only be the first step on this moon mission, as no real news has even been released yet. It's also possible that the jump we saw today could be pure speculation and the price will fall back into the $7-8 range next week and stay there until actual news is released. I'm not saying buy or don't buy right now, but I wanted to get this DD out here before the stock really moons. Just wanted to give everyone a chance to read into this company over the long weekend.

Regardless of this short-term spike, the play here is the sheer number of possible catalysts in their pipeline at the moment. The stock currently trades at a $2.6B market cap, which leaves room for a huge move upwards. The company has increased their cash while lowering debt in the last year, meaning they should be in no danger of going under in the near term. They generated $28M in revenue in the first 9 months of 2020 from their one existing product, and this revenue could double if they get any of their new products approved.

SRNE closed at $9.50 today, but the **average 1-yr estimate on this company is $25**, which in my view is completely attainable if any of their products attain FDA approval and make it to the market.

If you're looking for any other reasons to get on the SRNE train, the company has a CEO in Dr. Henry Ji who publicly hates shorts as much as we all do.

*""I am giving them a fair warning shot. Just cover yourself, don't ruin your family,"" Ji said of short sellers who he says are trying to manipulate Sorrento's stock.*

[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/26/sorrento-therapeutics-opened-up-117-after-ceo-slam/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/26/sorrento-therapeutics-opened-up-117-after-ceo-slam/)

(Seriously, with the amount of hype around this stock, it takes almost nothing to move it double-digit percentage points)

Even after this declaration back in August, there are still 68M shares sold short as of 12/31/20. It's not GME level short interest, but it would accelerate the rockets if any big approval news is released.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/srne/short-interest](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/srne/short-interest)

I'm not as experienced with options trading as most of you are, but if you want to buy calls I would buy them at least a few months out. The news that could send this stock up 100% is likely imminent, but it will be impossible to predict its timing since we are dealing with FDA approval here. It could be next week, it could be in March. My guess is as good as yours. I wouldn't buy any weeklies or FD's and expect to hit it big. If you like what you read here, take some of your GME profits and buy a few shares and hold on till this baby hits $20+

As always, do your own research into the stock before throwing your money at it.

**Positions:** Too dumb for options so I'm holding 500 boomer shares at $7.21.

**TLDR:** Biotech company with over a dozen potential COVID/Cancer/Pain Relief products in various stages of FDA approval process. Potential EUA approval for rapid COVID testing product sometime in the next month = 🚀. CEO hates shorts. Buy shares or longer-term options to ensure that you are holding when any news hits.

Gamestop Friday Notes - Short Sellers will loose 🚀🚀🚀,0.95,"&#x200B;

Today has been an incredible day for us despite the 11% share price drop. I want to use this opportunity to thank everyone for holding their line. Many of us, including myself, have bought more shares today and will continue to do so until we see the actual squeeze happening.

  

### 📅 This has happened today:

* An annoucement was made that GME board members who are resigning have sold their shares causing today's price drop as a reaction by the market to these news (NEGATIVE but the market came together and held the line to minimize impact)
* Fidelity and Schwab are confirmed to have eliminated margin on $GME (NEUTRAL)
* There is current talk about margin calls going out soon (POSITIVE)
* Uptick rule (SEC 210) is in effect until at least EOD Tuesday (POSITIVE)  


### 🔮 This will happen soon:

* Short sellers will be margin called soon - there is no way around this now
* **We will have another large squeeze**
* GameStop will undergo a huge transformation and capitalize on the ever-growing esports / video game market

&#x200B;

### 🐻 Melvin and other short sellers

You targeted the wrong firm! You were gambling on 45,000+ people (FT & PT) to loose their jobs as GameStop would slowly go out of business. 

But guess what: after Ryan Cohen bought further into GME this will never happen. The team at RC Ventures will make sure of that. And us, we will hold the line and buy further into it until we get rid of all large short positions. GME is not a dead company, it is just getting started.

**GameStop is here to stay and will undergo an amazing transformation!**

&#x200B;

Note: For everyone who is new to this, please be aware that options have very low impact on share prices and that volatility (among many other things) plays a huge factor in your trades. Be careful with your trades and always do your own due diligence.

SEC filings today showed that GME insiders are selling stock. The absence of a filing from any Cohen/related may be more telling of what the future has to hold than the sales we know about,0.95,"I'll keep it short

* Board members that are likely on their way out are selling shares
* An additional board member's (Kurt Wolf's)  fund sold a bunch of shares the other day to align with their concentration guidelines for individual stock positions. Essentially the price went up too much and the position got too big as a percent of total assets so they sold some.
* Per the recent agreement Ryan Cohen signed with the company he is not allowed to own more than a 19.9% steak. As of the most recent filing he only owns 12.9%
* Form 4 (change in ownership over 10% and transactions by insiders) must be filed within 2 business days (Ryan Cohen and new board member are subject to this one)
* Forms 13-D (ownership over 5%) & Form 3 (new steaks over 10% and initial statements by insiders) must be filed within 10 days (Other large buyers are subject to form 13-D and the new board members are subject to form 3)

The Important Part:

Because we didn't have a Form 4 filed today by Ryan Cohen the massive move Wednesday was not fueled by him picking up an additional 7%. This means he likely still has dry powder to buy more stock if he wants it. Additionally no forms 13-D or 3 means that the new directors may not have picked up shares yet either (if they want them). Additional share buying from RC/Friends could help send this to the moon   🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀

"#BB Gang, who of you holded the line today and did not run from the battlefield?",0.92,"Today was a crazy day.  The whole market is down, nothing makes any sense and all the paper hands probably abandoned the ship before the long weekend.

I am still mad, despite being in profit cuz I have no fucking idea how it is possible for a stock to drop 20 percent after open without crushing negative news. I have never seen something like this. However, there is no room for panic. Apple is expected to have historic earnings in less than 2 weeks and the stock experienced a huge dip today, GME fell hard also and every fucking autist here was buying it. We finished the day at 8 percent up.

I would not judge anyone who sales next week, not everyone needs to be a long term investor, but fuck the paper handed mfos who bought shares today and immediatly sold 1 hour later. How much can you actually lose? The absolute bottom is 4 per share and that would put the company at 2.5 bil valuation. The brand name is worth more than that and BB is a significant player in the IoT, Cybersecurity and EV industries. The cyber firm Crowdstrike has  180 mil revenue compared to BB near 1 billion and is valued at 50 billion, ten times more than BB. If you are gonna paper hand, at least wait till you are an in profit, the retards  who sold GME after the last dip are deeply regretting it now.

However, my worry was completely misguided. The number of shares on loan reported from brokers that sell their data actually increased by millions both January 13 and January 14, entailing a record high GME estimated short interest of ***79.52 million*** as of the end of yesterday:

(Today's data will be available tomorrow.) The site I got this from also compares their estimates to prior reported SI and it seems to be extremely accurate. In other words, the shorts haven't even begun to cover--they're just digging themselves deeper.

A case for $LLY,0.74,"If you make pharma plays (*blessing be to his holiness Martin Shkreli*) you probably already know about $LLY's antibody treatment for COVID-19 called Bamlanivimab ([https://www.fda.gov/media/143602/download](https://www.fda.gov/media/143602/download)), so piss off.

This is for everyone else who has probably only heard of Regeneron's **monoclonal antibody** offering because the Overweight Orange Squatter at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave received a dose.

So why $LLY and why now, since this antibody treatment has been approved since November?

Well, as Einstein famously said, ""*The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.*""

Unless you've just recovered from a coma, you know that in 5 days there will be a new proverbial sheriff in town in Washington, DC.  Along with him will be a new Covid Task Force and I bet you my $GME shares they will absolutely NOT stay the present course of, well, doing whatever the hell it is that's being done now.

Remember, there are already doses of Bamlanivimab (let's just call it ""BAM"" for short) because it's an existing drug that received FDA Emergency Use Authorization for Covid. $LLY is already making more BAM and, more importantly, $LLY is already testing BAM against the mutated versions of Covid (TL;DR- looking good for the UK variant, not so good for the SA variant). Remember also that $LLY struck a deal with the US Government for $1,250 per dose of BAM.

Now the tricky thing about BAM is that it has to be administered early, when Covid is first detected. It's also an intravenous drug, so administration takes a few hours. This of course has been a logistical nightmare for over-stretched healthcare facilities.

BTW, if you want to see if BAM is already available near you go to [https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/therapeutics-distribution#distribbution-locations](https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/therapeutics-distribution#distribbution-locations)

Anyway, my thesis is the Biden team will push for some kind of centralized Covid Crisis Centers (yeah, I freaking love alliteration, bite me) that will do (1) Testing, (2) Therapeutics, and (3) Vaccinations.  Imagine it: get a rapid test for Covid and, if it's appropriate, head over to Area B for $LLY's BAM treatment. If your rapid test is negative, well head over to Area C for Vaccination.

Well, thank you for coming to my TEDTalk.

If you think I'm full of shit, please do consider something like $XPH because I guarantee you in five days the Biden Administration is going to come out swinging for the fence on a changed-up Covid response.  If you think I might be onto something, stop and ponder Covid pharma company names-which company names already come to mind: Pfzier, J&J, and Regeneron? That's why I'm thinking $LLY is my dark horse.

TL;DR: $LLY = Moon

$GME board members not standing for reelection selling out of their positions,0.97,"Raul Fernandez, Kathy Vrabeck, and Lizbeth Dunn today released filings in after hours that they had sold a combined and approximated 2.75 million dollars in $GME stock. Coincidentally, these are 3 of the 4 directors that will not be standing for reelection, and are being replaced by Ryan and Co.

Personally, I'm not worried. Gamestop needs less deadweight in its leadership, and by selling in a bullish uptrend, they've demonstrated exactly the lack of vision that made them unfit leaders.

"PLUG, And why the next three years are going to be humongous.",0.84," 

Alright, shut the fuck up about GME for a second and Im gonna make you money. y'all heard alot about PLUG from a few places as of late. Yes, it has exploded 135% in the last month alone but it isn't over. Right now, the sentiment is bearish and I agree in the short term, but long term PLUG is only going to keep growing. There are a few key points I want to highlight.

PLUG is single-highhandedly the largest hydrogen-fuel-cell titan in the industry. 20 years of industry under its belt, it now services Amazon with 40,000 active forklifts and Walmart uses roughly 10,000 active vehicles. Now, they are partnering with two more titans. Renault and SK Group. The French and South Korean markets respectively. First, Renault. Renault is well established in France, and is backed by the government itself. The deal with Renault is HUGE for plug in the European market. **The two plan to establish an innovation center for development of fuel cell technology in LCV vehicles** ***for*** **future Renault platforms. Initially, heavy vans and utility. They plan on combining manufacturing with Renault, establishing a vertically integrated fuel cell stack system and a manufacturing center in France. Expansion of refueling systems to accommodate the new market. The deal will only accelerate in the future as Renault plans to adopt Plug Power technology in commercial fleets.** Why is Renault Interested? Well, the EU announced a plan calling for Europe to have at least six gigawatts of renewable hydrogen electrolyzers by 2024 (A critical period for PLUG for a few more reasons) and the production of up to 1 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen. Doable, sure, but the bigger picture is this:

This is almost exactly how the rise of the solar industry happened. EU plans into the future. The European Union unveiled a plan this month to invest hundreds of billions of euros in technologies enabling it to get a substantial share of its energy from hydrogen by 2050. This is potentially **insane**.

([https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/hydrogen\_strategy.pdf](https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/hydrogen_strategy.pdf))

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Second group. SK Group is planning to invest 1.5 billion USD in an intention to form a joint venture next year. The goal is to provide South Korea (and later a possibility of the larger Asian Market) hydrogen fuel cell systems. Particularly, Infrastructure and electrolyzers (power stations, basically). There is, however, no information if PLUG is planning on directly partnering with any manufacturers in Korea. (I will get to this later). Why is SK Group interested in Plug? Plans call to build a liquid hydrogen plant with an annual capacity of 30,000 tons in Incheon in **2023**, to be scaled up to 280,000 tons in **2025**. The South Korean government's commitment to shift the to Hydrogen with 729 Million dollars this year. A 30% increase from last year.

([https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/060120-asian-countries-accelerate-hydrogen-plans-with-policies-and-projects](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/060120-asian-countries-accelerate-hydrogen-plans-with-policies-and-projects))

*Now, whats the point of all this infrastructure? I understand the powerplants but is the future just going to be us driving in Amazon forklifts?* \- Says you, a dumbass who doesnt do DD and leaves it up to others in what is basically a Casino.

Sweet summer child..

Hydrogen fuel is going to be big in the automotive scene. Yes, Papa Musk hates it, so fucking what? keep buying one year out calls @ 50% OTM and tell Musk to fuck off with how much bank you're going to make.

GM may have made a statement that they are going for ALL hydrogen back in 2017, but they have since rescinded that statement. Their Hydrogen plan still remains though, Fuel-cell power-trains will be used in military and commercial vehicles. ([https://twitter.com/mikewayland/status/1283734665157922816?lang=en](https://twitter.com/mikewayland/status/1283734665157922816?lang=en))

Honda is already selling a vehicle with hydrogen fuel cell technology. The Honda Clarity. They plan on expanding on the line greatly as they seem to be extremely set on becoming green.

Hyundai is already selling a vehicle with hydrogen fuel cell technology, the Hyundai Nexo. **Hyundai Motor Group and its suppliers plan to spend of 7.6 trillion won (US$6.7 billion) through 2030 to raise production of fuel cells by more than 200-fold as the South Korean automaker targets to become a key player in the new-energy vehicle technology.**

So much money is flowing into Hydrogen fuel cell technology, why is noone capitalizing on it?

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The play: Wait for volatility to die down, PLUG has had a massive run up. Truly tremendous, and I'm glad to have been in PLUG for a long while. The hype is almost certainly blown up, and general market attitude is that it is a sell which I agree with.

TLDR: PLUG is going to return from low-earth orbit to refuel, my price target is 50 by mid-FEB before PLUG does a Hindenburg and the price fucking explodes. 🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

Position:

Wait for good entry: PLUG 70C 06/18. Yes its fucking expensive, wait for better entry and learn how to do spreads, dumbass. You bet big and win big.

If you have more than 6 brain cells or are straight up fucking broke: Buy LEAPS and Shares on the dip thats about to happen.

GM stock is gonna be huge over the next couple years. Their moving almost entirely to an EV lineup, we all already know about the green energy spending plan, ton's of cash on hand, good vehicle market share already, reasonably priced right now.

Their CEO also had a good interview on Freakanomics podcast a few weeks ago. She's completely upending their old stuffy corporate culture, getting rid of dress codes, focus on innovation.

NOW FOR THE REALLY IMPORTANT PART so try to stay with me

**GM** is 2 of the 3 letters in GME (that means it's 66.6666666% gamestop)  
**GM** makes electric vehicles now  
TESLA makes electric vehicles  
TESLA's stock price is $845 as I write this

66.666666666% multiplied by $845 is $563.33

Even Cramer's buddies don't get it yet - Why GME still will go higher,0.97,"You know how Cramer gave us a shoutout about GME on Mad Money? Yea turns out even his colleagues aren't on board. 

[https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/gamestop-s-charts-show-us-more-risk-than-reward-15540628](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/gamestop-s-charts-show-us-more-risk-than-reward-15540628)

This absolute 🌈🐻 starts the article off by saying oh, short squeeze is an ""investable"" opportunity, but then tells us how technical are bad. 

For those who can't access the article:

""Prices are above the rising 50-day moving average line and well above the rising 200-day moving average line. With the 200-day line around $9 and prices around $40 we can declare that prices are extended or overbought compared to this indicator.

The On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been strong since early August and the slow stochastic indicator tells us that prices are overbought. The upper shadows above $40 tell us that traders are beginning to reject these gains. 

Bottom line strategy: Right at this juncture in time, the charts of GME show more risk than reward. Stand aside. ""

&#x200B;

This absolute retard who supposedly had 43 years of experience and still believes technicals are king and actually matter something on huge news reports. As if Ryan Cohen being added to board of directors isn't a catalyst, as if the shorts having to cover isn't a reason for a short squeeze. Betcha that VW short squeeze had real good technicals and wasn't overbought, yikes. 

All this shows us is that boomers still haven't caught on and boomer retail ain't even dipping their feet in yet. While there's definitely less 🌈🐻s now, most people haven't bought into GME yet which means it has so much more room to grow. 

**TLDR**; The rocket hasn't left yet.

$BBBY - triple buy rating. 50% intrinsic upside + the next biggest squeeze potential,0.62,"Let’s face it, most of us missed gme. Of course gme will hit $500/share end of year, but for all other semi-retarded autist, lemme tell you why you should be buying $bbby right now before close. 

- Very well regarded Mark Tritton (former Target CMO) became a CEO just over a year ago. He’s the only the 3rd CEO and 1st outsider in the company’s history who’s very optimistic about a turnaround

- they’ve sold non-core assets and expect to raise additional $350mm-$450mm in cash from non-core that will be pushed towards digital sales

- Digital Comps up 94% YoY. Penetration online continues to grow drastically with a 31% annual growth rate

- More digital means wider margins. Gross Margins increased from 32.2% to 35.4% which simply means they make 3% more on every sale which is huge. 

- They’ve increased the planned share buy-back from $675mm to $825mm in the next 3 years. That’s 1/3 of the fucking float which signals the confidence of the management 

- Haters might point Net income was negative. True, but it was mainly due to $2.469 billion NON recurring  restructuring cost. If we omit that cost, the net income over the past three years is +$500mm. 

- EV/EBITDA is 10.01 vs conservative 12.7 industry average at the time of this post. So that alone should put us at a fair value of $35/share today. Based on forward EBITDA for 2021, that’s $39/share in the next 12 months. And that’s not accounting for share buyback.


Sounds good right. But wait, there’s more


-BBBY is the 5th most shorted stock over $1 billion MC with 68% of short float. You all know #1, the other 3 are garbage. Just like u/runrun8 pointed, Michael Burry is in, and YES, the fucking Melvin has the audacity to short this one too. 

-Our king retard Cramer is pushing it (by frequently interviewing the CEO and explicitly saying that $BBBY is the next squeeze)

"Get in LUMN before it’s too late, retards",0.62,"If you were a fan of GME, then you ought to be a fan of Lumen Technologies, aka Dr. Burrys next value play. 

This play is dirt cheap with little downside, and yet to recover to pre-COVID highs, even with the explosion in fiber and 5G. Lumen currently sits around $10, pre-COVID it was around $15, but it can run so much further. Simplywall.st has a price target of $45, I would say that’s crazy but with GameStops value correction lately, who knows lol

Lumen has a big competitive advantage thanks to century link, and that’s its 450,000 mile fiber network. That places it in the top 2 in the US. With fiber and 5G becoming more mainstream, expect this stock to climb.  It’s been shifting it’s business away from the dying business model of Century Link, working on a rebrand, paying off debt, and have had good earnings. 

As lumen moves further from century links business and starts benefiting from its Level 3 acquisition which will boost profits and cashflow for years, I don’t see this going any lower anytime soon. 

I may be retarded, but I can’t pass this one up.
Wall Street has a history of incorrectly valuing restructuring companies. This is one of those times. 



TL;DR : Lumn is a good value play with little downside and Burry thinks so too 

Edit: forgot to mention she’s 80% institutionally owned

Why There's No Crash Coming,0.93,"TLDR: stonks go up in 2021 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 

No doubt 2020 was an epic year for the market. A lot of people, especially ordinary Americans, made a lot of life-changing money, and that's good.

More and more people are coming out of the woodwork talking about 2000s, market crash, etc. Even though I am a moron, for the life of me I cannot see any reason for a massive market crash to happen anytime soon. Do any of you idiots see anything wrong with my DD on the subject, below?

1. JPOW, the guy with the money printer that goes BRRRRRRRR, confirmed this week that there is not going to be any adjustments to the massive bond-buying/QE program anytime soon
2. Interest rates will remain at zero throughout 2023, meaning the discount rate will remain at 0, driving up the present value of financial assets
3. Janet Yellen is known to be extremely dovish, which at the very least won't hurt
4. We're currently in what is likely to be the worst phase of the pandemic, meaning: the worst economic news is coming out now and the latest round of stimulus isn't reflecting yet in the economic data
5. While vaccinations are starting to pick up steam, by no means are they close to the point where society begins to reopen, which will likely begin happening in late March/April.
6. There's MASSIVE pent-up demand from 2020 that will be pulled forward to 2021: going out, dining, travel, nightclubs, bars, retail, entertainment, sports, seeing friends and family - this will provide an epochal stimulus to the U.S. economy, and we will see truly blockbuster GDP growth numbers after Q1 2021
7. The savings rate for Americans is at an ATH
8. Consumer debt is at an all-time low
9. Fintech firms like Robinhood, laugh at them as we may (even though most people here use them), simply have made equities and derivatives accessible for the average person. Trust me, you're not special for signing up for a TD Ameritrade account and downloading the Thinkorswim app - anyone can. The UI just sucks and most people would rather use Robinhood. The age of the retail investor is here - look at $BB, $GME, etc. What would be the catalyst for retail investors to pull out of the market? And in terms of RH making money on the back end, the reality is most people don't care if their trade gets filled at $10.48 or $10.46 as long as they see COMMISSION: $0. Why is this any different from a deli charging you $2.50 instead of $2 for a bottle of Poland Spring because they pay 2.5% to their cc processor?
10. U.S. companies are sitting on a record cash pile: [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-companies-cash/u-s-companies-sitting-on-record-cash-pile-sp-global-idUSKBN28I36I](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-companies-cash/u-s-companies-sitting-on-record-cash-pile-sp-global-idUSKBN28I36I)
11. Transformational industries like EV's, hydrogen power, big data, cloud computing, renewable energy - this is really happening, and happening now. And without Trump in the way, these trends will only accelerate (climate change, electrification, and so forth). Industries like clean energy have taken decades to get to this point. While DoorDash and Uber are cool, they're also just consumer conveniences, so people can spend $33 ordering pizza and wings to their overpriced apartment. While the story of the 2010's was consumer convenience, the market potential of the 2020's we will go back to major, earth-changing industry.
12. While there are certainly mini-bubbles, isn't that more healthy than one massive bubble? If investors overprice hydrogen power stocks and they correct by 25%, it doesn't ruin the economy like the dot-com boom, subprime crisis etc.
13. Rents went down in major metropolitan areas like NYC, San Francisco, etc. - which means people, specifically MILLENNIALS whose assets topped $10 trillion for the first time recently, will have more disposable income to save and invest. While rents won't stay low forever, this will provide a massive short-term stimulus for the millions of people who call these areas home. Moreover, incentives - like 1/2/3/4 months free - will put more money into savings of younger people, who spend more than boomers.

I see interest rates going up, inflation, and mispricing of future income from these new industries like EV's, renewables, and so forth (aka ""bubbles"") being the biggest counterarguments here, but interested to hear what the smart money on wsb is thinking

How did I come across this stock? Well, my mom and sister constantly, I mean constantly, go to Michael's. They want to purchase canvases, art supplies, and other activities to stay away from screens.

Not only that, it's incredibly easy to purchase and they have a great curbside experience.

DD: If you look at Michaels.com, check out their ""Alexa.com"" score. This gives a good indication of their website traffic almost doubling in the past year.

The market cap you ask? 2.47B.
2019 Revenue: 5B 2019 Net Income: 272.6M

The parallels are insane between Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) and GameStop.

GME: dying boomer Game brick-and-mortar retail store shorted to the ground and given hope by innovative activist investor Ryan Cohen
BBBY: dying boomer brick-and-mortar retail store shorted to the ground and given hope by innovative CEO Mark J. Tritton

GME: #1 most shorted high-cap company with 104% short float
BBBY: #4 most shorted high-cap company with 70% short float + $825M share buy back program (will further reduce the public float by ~25% which will put short float on par with GME)

GME: low of $2.57 in April 2020, has short squeezed 15x to $42 (Michael Burry got in under $5)
BBBY: low of $3.43 in April 2020, has short squeezed 8x to $28 (Michael Burry got in under $5). If GME can hit $42 by fucking shorts, BBBY can too at the very least.

GME: shorted to the ground by the infamous Melvin Capital
BBBY: yes the boomers at Melvin Capital are also shorting the hell outta this one

RC didn't join in to print a few billion, he wants to grow the company. Chads here don't seem to realize that companies with falling revenues get punished and see a contraction in their price to sales (P/S) ratio. Companies that do well are valued at a premium based on future sales growth projections. Now I'm no mathegician and can't tell you how long it will take to turn GME around and what growth figures we're going to see, but I played around with a few numbers just to see where the share price would end up at different P/S multiples.

Edit: For those that don't want to click link. Here is the 7th bullet. There are other special rules and exemptions listed in link. If unsure ask a tax expert.

Q: If I anticipate a sizable capital gain on the sale of an investment during the year, do I need to make a quarterly estimated tax payment during the tax year?

A:

Generally, you must make estimated tax payments for the current tax year if both of the following apply:

You expect to owe at least $1,000 in tax for the current tax year after subtracting your withholding and refundable credits, and

You expect your withholding and refundable credits to be less than the smaller of:

90% of the tax to be shown on your current year's tax return, or

100% of the tax shown on your prior year’s tax return. (Your prior year’s tax return must cover all 12 months.)   ",2021-01-15 12:43:05

GME Gang - A Word of Caution,0.85,"I'm not gonna lie, it's kinda fun to see Cramer and the Wall Street Journal talking up this place.  It's been even more fun the past two days racking up high scores on my account.  And I am so happy for DFV I could piss rainbows.

But (and this is going to be unpopluar)...

Just because we seem to be on top right now does not mean we actually are.  Almost all of us, myself included, got our DD from DFV and a couple of the other OG GME Gang, thought it made sense, and had the balls to back up their analysis with our money.  I don't know about you, but I sure as hell didn't plow through two years of 10-Ks to make my decision.  They found the chink in the armor, and we have been exploiting the fuck out of it the last couple of months.

I don't care what Cramer says: we don't control the market.  He's blowing smoke up our collective ass so we'll watch his show, and so the people who \*do\* control the market watch his show and get angry.  We don't even come close to controlling the market.  All I see us doing is pointing out that the analysts at Melvin and BoA have been lazy, and people there are gonna get fired over this.  The ones that are left will adapt, and they have much deeper pockets than we do.  And all the memeing, all the dancing-in-the-end-zone posts, all the declarations of ""I AM THE CAPTAIN NOW"" will not change that fact.  And seeing the rash of ""HERE'S THE NEXT SHORT SQUEEZE OPPORTUNITY"" posts should be a warning bell for everyone.

We are catching lightning in a bottle with GameStop.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime play, with a perfect storm of a severely undervalued company, an incorrect narrative about its balance sheet, really poor analysis regarding its viability, and a couple of high-profile investors who saw what DFV was seeing a year ago.  Ryan Cohen has played this perfectly since he got to 12% ownership; how many of you are willing to bet that the next bozo to buy a large minority position in an undervalued company won't do what Eddie Lampert did to Sears: tear the thing apart, sell its components off, and fuck the customers and stockholders?

**TL;DR:** Be careful, be humble, enjoy your tendies. Don't expect this to happen all of the time, and for Ghu's sake, don't believe the press.  Their narrative is not your reality.

14/01 GME Price Action,0.98,"Listen up, this is only just beginning. We all saw that gap up to $41.50 dollars from $36.92 in about 20 minutes. GME wanted to go a lot higher yesterday but the shorts used all of their firepower to keep it down, and they couldn’t even keep it below $39 at end of day. Profit taking also contributed to the drops throughout the day probably, but don’t take profits now, Jesus does this even need to be said. Do you want to be walking around in 3 months and see some guy in a Ferrari with a license plate that reads GME or do you want to be that guy.

So why are the shorts on the ropes, I went through why the shorts didn’t cover much volume during the 13/01 in my previous post and it is the same story yesterday. There was a general balance between buy and sell orders throughout the day (14/01) and there was less volume than the day before, THERE IS NO WAY THE SHORTS HAVE COVERED BUT THEY HAVE SHORTED MORE in the last couple of days.

Here are some details, link 1 below shows that the short volume is stills currently 137.51% of the float. We can have a lot of fun with that. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxhqo5/gme\_when\_evaluating\_potential\_for\_further\_short/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxhqo5/gme_when_evaluating_potential_for_further_short/)

Secondly, the short borrow fee at the moment is 45.26%, the highest it has ever been. I get better rates when I borrow money from my friendly local loan shark to yolo weeklies with. This means that there are very little shares left to borrow, we were down to 400’000 shares left to borrow at close yesterday and shorts are still borrowing shares to keep the price down. This is demonstrated by the 17 million in short volume on 14/01, in addition to 46 million on 13/01. Just opening these positions is killing the shorts, but they are doing it to keep the price down. All of this can be seen here: [https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)

Summary: Do not sell, tell your friends, parents, distant relatives, priests, drug dealers and doctors to buy more shares in this shit. The price action since the start of the week is just a correction to FAIR VALUE, this isn’t an inflated price at all. And it has corrected to that despite shorts pulling every trick in the book. This rocket is only lifting off.

The BBBY Short Squeeze (Little Sister of All Short Squeezes),0.95,"**TLDR**: BBBY Rocket Ship Emoji, Calls (3/19 25-35cs) and Shares

First, I like to reiterate my own retarded investing tenets to make sure any plays I make align with it: 

Overall:

1. I'm a retard and don't know anything.

Bull Market specific tenets (if you're a gay bear move on):

1. The market is undervalued, and 

2. Small businesses are getting crushed by governments to the benefit of big business, due to COVID.

What's that mean? Sure, stocks may be overvalued, but the entire market is UNDERvalued, so your own internal stock valuations don't mean shit. Ask yourself, ""where the fuck else would I put my money?"" If you put it in a bank, printer goes BRRRR and you lose value. The only option is real assets: equities, real estate, and then to a lesser extent guns/ammo/food.

So this play, a boomer ass retail chain, sounds dumb as hell when I say it. That means it MUST be good. It's a big business, which our government is bending over backwards to give free money to. Big stores have cash on hand, which smaller businesses it competes with don't. It has an online presence. Online presence sounds useless, except COVID is forcing the move to online quicker than even the most skilled executive could pivot those old store-based retail ships. And COVID/WFH means they get to drop their unprofitable stores, employee benefits, and dead weight faster without any blow back from consumers.

All of this is even BEFORE I look at [BBBY specifically](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/financial-information/sec-filings). Let's get into it:

* BBBY has cash on hand, $1.5B to be exact (+$0.5B since COVID began. See? What did I say?)

* They grew online sales by 77%, with over a third of them through in store deliveries (aka, customers in stores. If you're tarded, that means good).

* Margins are going up +3.1% (another side effect of COVID, less costs). They also STARTED to cut and streamline their inventory which hasn't even fully been taken into effect yet, since it takes months if not years to liquidate their old junk, but the costs are coming down there.

* Most importantly, the people. They hired Target exec Mark Tritton as their CEO and he's been doing really well pivoting them online, just like he did with Target (What do you think of when you think of Amazon competitors? Wal Mart and Target). He also brought a ton of improved private brands to BBBY, and if you're a retard like me, private brands = margin (that means money).  Sure, he's not Ryan Cohen, but [he's no slouch](https://www.retaildive.com/news/one-year-in-mark-trittons-turnaround-at-bed-bath-beyond/587680/).

Finally, this is one of the highest shortest stocks on the market, at [61.2%](https://www.highshortinterest.com/) and INCREASING.

So let's recap so far:

* New Exec with a proven track record.

* An actual profitable business and online presence.

* Tailwinds (gov and economic) pushing them to profitability (not even including their smaller inventory + private brands growth).

* Shorted out the ass.

Sound like GME? Nope, it's BBBY. It's not going to be like GME's almost infinity squeeze (praise be to DFV), but it could be the LITTLE SISTER OF ALL SHORT SQUEEZES.

Is it too late to get in on some $BBBY tendies? I think not!,0.86,"**TL:DR:** Get in, loser. We're riding this baby to Uranus. short positions most likely increased after ""shit"" earnings that were not bad at all. we've only seen the beginning of the squeeze as Technicals look unsustainable long term but primed for a rally short term, share buyback working in tandem with Cramer pumping the stock creates a bloodbath for gay bears. Buying stock is best just like GME because you wanna move that ticker baby. Calls for ballsy tendies

&#x200B;

This week has been **great** for bulls. First GME came through for us and fucked over Melvin and the rest of the boomers leaving us with all these sweet tendies to pick up off the ground and BBBY has EXPLODEDDD this week following a bad earnings call that led to a huge sell off and retreat to **$17** from **over $21**. But was the earnings call really as bad as everyone thought it was? Is the price movement just a result of a short squeeze that is already over?

I think not

1. earnings were **not** as bad as people acted they were, you bet your ass bears tried to short this shit in reaction to the supposed negative numbers while over looking these : **69% increase in digital sales, 150 million share buyback program to complete by end of Feb, continually trimming debt, pivoting to curbside/delivery/digital sales programs and increasing the value of coupons through membership programs to promote brand loyalty** (think Amazon Prime free shipping), **RECCURING REVENUE BUNDLE ( THIS SHIT IS CRACK FOR YOY GROWTH, think AMZN, NFLX, and even NIO now)**

2. **76 million shares in short interest out of 114 free floating.** this is self explanatory after GME but whats interesting is these numbers are from a December 31st settlement. This absolutely grew over the earnings on the 7th. making this potential for profit even more likely. our favorite boomer, Cramer, also pumped the fuck outta this stock on Mad Money TWICE recently stating the short interest is an attempt by bears to capture the stock despite strong promise from within the company.

3. **Active war between bulls and bears...and the bulls are winning.**

1. **TA looks incredibly solid.** Riding the RSI at 70 all day baby. MACD Signal line cross was never destructive, consolidates around support levels, then built up a climb over time, challenging areas of support and bouncing off of them to new highs and lower lows. Trending above 50 day MA, 25 day EMA, and using 10 day MA as support, testing multiple times throughout the day and later consolidating alongside it today until AH.

SPWR SHORT SQUEEZE TO THE MOON,0.67,"&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[\\""I imagine a future where SPWR panels are creating a dyson sphere around the sun\\""-Albert Einstein](https://preview.redd.it/tuzg186cneb61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=74fa8517a8517e1af2588662ec861e5c7c9712ea)

Edit--I'm in this play to the fucking moon bois. My whole portfolio is on 1/22/21 calls, so im putting my money where my mouth is.

**TL/DR for those with reading issues:** SPWR 45 strike 1/22/21, Or, if you're feeling like not being quite as degenerate and reckless as I am, SPWR 45 strike 1/29/21

Today we are all going to have a little fireside chat about SPWR (Sun Power), and the Tendies it will add to your wheelbarrow of money you are making off GME and BB. Lets start with the basics. SPWR is a solar cell and electric storage company.

**1) Overall Market Conditions--And how SPWR is set to benefit**

We all know how Biden is set on America entering a new era of clean energy, and now he has all the tools of government to do so. Biden is going to be pumping tendies into renewable energy, our goal is to pump our tendies into these companies first. With that being said, SPWR creates solar cells (solar panels and home renewable energy systems) that produce up to 360 W of energy, while typical panels only produce 250 to 270 W. SPWR actually has the WORLD RECORD for sunlight to electric conversion efficiency at 24.2 percent, as confirmed by the US department of energy. There is a high probability of this specific company getting subsidized by the Govt.

**2) SPWR is shorted to oblivion.**

We all love sticking shoes in the mouths of all those snuffy, ostentatious, snooty, wall street shorters who look at a company's P/E ratio and think that's all that matters. NOW IS OUR CHANCE TO DESTROY THEM YET AGAIN. SPWR has a short interest of **50.81 PERCENT.** The moment it squeezes, its going to make them have to sell their suits just so they can short the next stock we will collectively moon. Also shorts STILL HAVE NOT COVERED.

3) CHART: SPWR had a thicc line of resistance at 33. The stock got rejected from that key level twice, before just breaking out today to new highs at 36. She held 35's and is looking to make a short squeeze imminently to 40's and possibly higher.

**4) Basic fundamentals for those who give a shit.**

Revenues for SPWR are expected to grow 23.21% this year, and is expected to have an EPS increase of 184.2% for 2021. SPWR also has a history of beating earnings, beating earnings estimates the last 4 quarters.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In conclusion, lets become scientists and prove the multiverse theory correct by tendie training this stock to a parallel universe.

&#x200B;

Love you all,

**The Big Short Squeeze**

Michael Burry is analyzing through sheer brain power all of the shorts at GameStop, and how insane Tesla is. Gets laughed at for shorting Tesla and going long on GameStop.

But then GameStop starts going up and this group of traders on social media start building a huge position, founded on complete degeneracy and worship of Amazon rival Ryan Cohen. A YouTube with 100k and a dream posts about gme on his Reddit account u/DeepFuckingValue and people begin worshipping him. Then it happens. GME skyrockets. Major outlets take notice of social media traders and the short ratio. The price shoots up even higher as retail investors fight what they call the “gay bears” or 🌈 🐻. And they trigger the squeeze eventually, realizing millions of dollars entering the hands of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people.

My major fuck up in $GME and my comeback with $BB,0.92,"Now this is the history about an autist that got kinda lucky;

&#x200B;

Since last week, i've been watching out on blackberry, doing some posts/comments here to inform people that it was gonna be a good investment, because i saw a post about $BB comeback and did my research.

&#x200B;

Long story short, im a broke ass retard that is only able to save 240$ a month, due to low wages in my sector, so dont save much and my plan is to buy a house and cut my rent in half.

My savings were 1.3k in a JP Morgan technology fund, in 3 months i got a 15% return, but still not good enough. I knew something big was coming for blackberry, the settlement with Facebook, huge EV marketshare, new phone coming 2021 with OnwardMobility... so i took a fucking 7k loan, going balls deep in blackberry.

Loan proof:  [https://imgur.com/5fzUTch](https://imgur.com/5fzUTch)

&#x200B;

I was holding 1.3k shares about 7.20$ for 1 week, seeing no much movement, BB today at +1% and GME at +20%, expecting to be 60$ a share by tomorrow, seeing the fucking rockets at GME, i decided to sell everything at BB and join the GME FOMO, turning to -$1.244,79 in 5 minutes, i saw $BB at 4% and i asked wtf is going on, something must have happened. Took the loss of 1.2k at GME and instantly bought back at BB, but to get the money lost faster, i margin the fuck out of 3k, since i know margin is no joke and didnt wanted to get greedy, turning it into 15k and ride the BB rocket i almost missed out.

Its not much for many of you here, but for a minimum wage worker, 26 years old, being close to afford a down payment on a house, this is a huge fucking deal for me.

I know BB will have a bumpy road ahead, but this stock is 100% worth 100$, even more.

"GME: When evaluating potential for further short squeeze, should we be looking for short interest to be going down or up?",0.98,"Basically I don’t know whether it’s better if the short interest goes up because that means there could be a further short squeeze or if we want to see the short interest going down because that means the shorts are covering which agrees with our hypothesis that this is a short squeeze causing this crazy upsurge. 

I read somewhere that as old shorts cover, new shorts are just coming in on GME. Can someone confirm from a data source whether this is true or not? And is this likely to mean we will see further squeeze in the future? This could literally be *the* short squeeze of the century happening in front of our eyes.  (cries with my vertical debit spread -_-)

UPDATE: someone posted GME short Interest of the following amounts the last few days. The short interest has gone UP the last few days surprisingly. 

1/11  - 142.59% SI of float
1/12 - 138.16% SI of float
1/13 - 137.73% SI of float
1/14 - 137.51% SI of float

We are so dumb, we’re right about this.  If you’ve read anything on this sub, you know we can be irrational.  


If you know anything about investing, you know the markets can be irrational longer than investors can remain solvent.  


Well guys, we’re the most irrational I’ve ever seen.  And we’re friggin good at it.  
*Ain’t no way anyone can out solvent our irrationality*


But if you don’t believe me, here’s some actually talking points:  


GME is Not dipping.  The math just isn’t there.  This is not a normal rally/hype.  It was a momentum thing.  It’s now becoming a squeeze within the next week.  


This doubling in under 48hrs has made all shorts unprofitable.  It doesn’t matter where they entered.  


Short seller’s peak profit happens if a stock goes to $0.  No one expects GME to be at $0 even in the next few years.  But assuming it could a month from now, let’s do the maths. 


Most shorts got in around $15 or less.  That means the most they can make is $15, **IF** GME goes to $0 (it won’t). 


Now any time you borrow anything, you have to pay interest on it, this includes shares.  The current interest rate is 45% (or higher).  The interest is on the price of the current shares, not the price they bought in at.  


This means on a share price of $40, they are paying nearly $0.06 a day to short it.  Doesn’t sound too expensive right? Until you realize that in less than 28 days (if they allow it compound), they will have paid more in interest than they could ever gain, even if GME went to $0 in February. 


Keep in mind, once a short seller realizes it is literally impossible to make money, they just need to time their exit.  Since this is a stampede of short sellers, the best time to exit is right away.  They literally can’t wait 3 weeks, or else they might as well quite a few more dollars a share (from the interest they’re going to accrue).  


Keep in mind, this is all voluntary covering.  There are also tons of accounts out there that will now have to cover due to margin calls and such.  


Keep in mind that 71 million shares are shorted.  That’s more than are technically available.  


Keep in mind that 20% of shares are locked up by Cohen &amp; such, who cannot sell for a few more months.  So that leaves even less shares for the shorts.  


Once most of the shorts cover (within 3 weeks), the price won’t drop overnight.  They have to buy more shares than available and anyone left holding shorts will still be buying.  And by that time, a new base &amp; support level should have been established.  


*****
Thinking of FOMOing? You should be fine with shares.  Still could see upside of 50%+ 
*****
I recommend buying shares, cause IV is crazy high and if MM somehow finds a way to eff with people, they will.  Sometimes they are smarter than me (but hey, that’s their job, I’m just an idiot). 
*****


Positions: 

104 shares @ $20.15
Sold $22 call (much regret, didn’t know squeeze would happen so soon, I’m an idiot)
Bought $38c 1/15exp 
Hope to add shares tomorrow morning &amp; maybe a call for next Friday.  But ... I have a high risk tolerance and have made a nice chunk, so if my calls go tits up, don’t care. 


*****
Shameless plug for the next huge move: 
Cash out half next week &amp; dump it in Apple calls (1/29 or 03/21) any strike, can’t go wrong.  I have $200c, $160c, $135c, 75 shares.  
*****


TL;DR: 
50% upside for GME


Shorts have to cover in less than 25 days or they literally will lose more than they could ever gain from shorting.  


45% interest payments on current share price hurts shorts.  


20% of shares are tied up &amp; not able to be sold. 


Shorters need to buy almost 200% of available shares in the next 3 weeks (assuming they want to cap their losses at 100%). 


Not too late to jump in with shares. 


Don’t wait for a dip.

“GME up 100% in 2 days. Used video game disks is a disruptive business model and we think this has a lot more room to run.”

“Speaking of hot new tech, remember Blackberry? They used to make those walkie talkie cell phones, now they’re making tech for EVs. That sector is so hot right now, we have a buy rating on this one too with a price target of $1000. We got this by taking TSLAs current price and adding 150 bucks to it.”

Tell me why I'm a Gen X Dip Shit (GME),0.87,"Image speaks for itself.  

Bought GME (to do my part to support the WSB brand and hold the line) and sold the 4/16/21 $50 dollar call for an insane $8.66.  Some of you probably bought them.  Yes, I miss out on upside above $50 but that won't last if it even happens.  Perhaps it does, even then I'm making $58.66 a share on a three month play and reloading.  

More likely we get a break towards $20 and I can sell the 3/21/21 $40's to another bag-holder for $9 a share.  Rinse, repeat.  One more time after that and I'm sitting on 1000 free GME shares and riding it to Valhalla for the final squeeze.

 🚀🚀 FDA Approval has until 1/22  💎✋ 

""Conditions given by FDA for voclosporin's APPROVAL was “ If 23.7 mg taken twice daily significantly improves complete renal response rates and there’s no significant side effects”. Voclosporin met both of those conditions in phase 3 trial and that’s essentially the reason Aurinia submitted NDA. Data from a total of 534 patients from AURA-LV and AURORA was integrated and presented, demonstrating that 268 patients with LN treated with voclosporin in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and low-dose steroids achieved statistically superior and faster Renal Response rates compared to 266 patients treated with MMF and steroids alone. The effects were also observed in Hispanic patients, a high-risk lupus nephritis population. Treatment with voclosporin resulted in clinically meaningful and a statistically significant higher Renal Response rate of 43.7% compared to 23.3% in the control arm at one year. The Company also presented PK data analyzed from the AURA-LV and AURORA studies further supporting the potential to eliminate the need for therapeutic drug monitoring.The AURA-LV and AURORA studies were of similar design and conducted in comparable patient populations. The data from both studies for subjects treated with the recommended voclosporin dose of 23.7 mg twice daily (AURORA n=179, AURA-LV n=89) or with matching placebo (AURORA n= 178, AURA-LV n=88) were therefore pooled for an integrated analysis. The data presented at ASN Kidney Week 2020 was submitted as part of voclosporin’s new drug application (NDA) to FDA as well. Based on potential patient population sales of voclosporin have been estimated from more than $1 billion to $2.2 billion. My prediction- Voclosporin will be approve and conservative price target between $35-50 upon approval. Good luck to all. ""

Hello everyone! Again, thanks to u/extraegg and his solid DD before battery day back in September. Like everyone else, I got rid of all of my VALE positions in disgust after battery day. However, the DD just made so much sense that I found myself returning back to it over and over. I eventually bought right the fuck back in.

200 shares bought at different times for a cost basis of $15.67. I had $12, $13, and $16 strike prices earlier in the year, but sold those to use the gains to take positions in MT, TECK, and a rather large position in GME (these last 2 days have been amazing).

Hope this gives people inspiration. VALE seems like too good of an opportunity to pass up this year, and probably for the next few years too.",2021-01-14 22:48:51

Evidence to suggest Apple just had a good quarter

\-The iphone 12 (released oct 2020)  had 2 million pre-orders within 24 hours which is massive in comparison to the 800,000 preorders of the iphone 11

\-28.9 billion in sales from macs in 2020 compared to 21.2 billion in 2019 (roughly  25% revenue growth in the sector)

\-iphone 12 sales have outperformed the iphone 11 by 21%

Recent history of how Apple’s stock reacts to their earnings reports.

&#x200B;

||Q4 2019|Q1 2020|Q2 2020|Q3 2020|Q4 2020|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|quarterly revenue|$64 billion|$91.8 billion|$58.3 billion|$59.7 billion|$64.7 billion|
|Increase from 1 yr quarter|2%|9%|1%|11%|1%|

|share price change (1 day)|3%|2.7%|2%|9.5%|\-6%|

&#x200B;

As far as I can tell as long as you don’t buy short term expiry calls it literally cannot go tits up. Although there is evidence to suggest Apple just had an outstanding quarter lets assume that they only see a share value increase of about 5% (a little below average) by Feb 5. With a 2/19 $130.00 c position you would still net about 25% in gains. With AAPL shares being down recently there’s more room for growth.

Position:

AAPL  2/19 $134.00 c

Today I sold all of my individual stocks and half my VOO shares, this along with all of my GME tendies will all be going into this speculation, if I’m being completely retarded please say something.

Here’s what Biden calls for:

Direct payments of $1,400 to most Americans, bringing the total relief to $2,000 including December’s $600 payments

Increasing the federal, per-week unemployment benefit to $400 and extend it through the end of September

Increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour

Extending the eviction and foreclosure moratoriums until the end of September

$350 billion in state and local government aid

$170 billion for K-12 schools and institutions of higher education

$50 billion toward Covid-19 testing

$20 billion toward a national vaccine program in partnership with states, localities and tribes

Make the Child Tax Credit fully refundable for the year and increase the credit to $3,000 per child ($3,600 for a child under age 6)

The plan is the first of two major spending initiatives Biden will seek in the first few months of his presidency, according to senior Biden officials.

#The second bill, expected in February, will tackle the president-elect’s longer-term goals of creating jobs, reforming infrastructure, combatting climate change and advancing racial equity.

Overall, I’m confident the squeeze will happen within the next month or so if not tomorrow/next week because melvin fucked up buying 54k puts expiring tomorrow. April calls will buffer you in case it doesn’t cause this shit will squeeze like nothing we’ve ever seen before.

"Reeeeeeeeecap of today and recent market driving news (Jan 14, 2021)",0.98,"* 76% of WSB who's still in GME collectively orgasmed yesterday as GME pushed to the stratosphere with the stock soaring as high as 90% during intraday high. Profit taking and volatile swings brought the shares down to a modest close of ""only"" up 57% at $31.40. u/DeepFuckingValue, who has titanium alloy diamond hands (now known as DFV hands) posted an update and to the surprise of no one, is still holding his 1,000 contracts of Jan 15 $20c on Wednesday afternoon. (Note: He took gains on the contracts today though I'm not sure at what point in the day while keeping his April $12c).

* The pump action resumed for GME this Thursday morning with premarket pushing the underlying back to $38 once again and commenced to another wild session of large movements. Initially trading around $34 to $36 in morning, GME started to rip once again when noon struck and ran as high as $43 for the day. GME closed the day up 27% to $40. If you're STILL not in GME, these back-to-back days have pushed IV to new highs and even OTM contracts months out will be commanding large premium (~160%+ IV for April and 140%+ for July). Proceed with caution (who am I kidding just go all in).

* Morning economic numbers: jobless claims continues its dismal trend, with first-time claims hitting 965k last week vs the consensus of 800k (oof). Last week's total was 784k. As with before, market did not react to the numbers cuz its PrIcEd iN. Import prices rose 0.9 in Dec vs 0.6 expected.

* Jpow spoke at 12:30 PM today in a Princeton Uni session and reaffirmed what everyone has largely expected: rates will continue to be low and while the Feds will raise rate eventually, Jpow says that its ""no time soon"" given economic situation.

* Are they big tech or big cuck? The market reversed course and big tech continues their sell off, with MSFT, AAPL, NFLX, and AMZN all retreating more than -1% as yet another sector rotation commenced. Payment providers got an extra dose of sell-off with V closing at -3.43% and MA closing at -5.25%, despite both having positive PT from Deutsche Bank today with V having a PT increase of $270 from $220 and MA PT increase of $420 from $383.

* Small caps performed strongly today as money flow throughout the day into ""value"" grabs. RUT/IWM closed the day up 2%. Notable underlyings beyond GME are BBBY (up 18.77%), MIK (up 9.6%), M (up 5%), WSM (up 4%), and KIRK (up 9.58%).

* In WSB meme stock land MT continues in its channel, gaining 2.95% today to close at $24.81 PLTR got hit with another downgrade, this time via Citi as the analysts believes the stock is vulnerable to a few upcoming catalyst, including lockup expiry and an deceleration in growth. PT for Citi is $15 (don't worry tho surely WSB is ""in control"" with this stock too). PLUG drilled more than -5.74% during intraday low as JPM initiated with a neutral rating and downgraded sector competitor FCEL. PLUG closed the day down -4.26% to $64.63 while FCEL closed the day down -8% to $17.60, fending off intraday low of more than -12%. ICLN, the clean tech ETF continues its range bound trading and will likely require a clear catalyst in terms of what the $2 tril stimulus actually entails to move further. Buckle up, loser.

* Despite being green most of the day, major indexes retreated to red as power hour neared. Indexes went red and lost all its morning gains as the sell-off accelerated into closing hours. DOW closed the day down -0.22% or -69 pts, IXIC closed down -0.12% or -16 pts, SPX closed -0.38% or -14 pts, and RUT closed up 2% or 43 pts. While the retreat was modest compare to yesterday's close, the intraday reversal was quite jarring esp if you're trading FDs (and let's face it, you definitely were loading up on those Jan 1/15 calls).

* Earning season will soon be upon us and the first wave are starting later this week. Tomorrow morning financials kick things off as WFC, JPM, and C are all reporting before market opens. If banks shat the bed, expect a pounding for the Dow given how large of a component they are still to the stupid index. Expectations are fairly high as JPM has had a flurry of upgrades in the past few days with PT of $150 from Piper Sandler, $152 from Jefferies, and an upgrade to buy from neutral at BofA.

* Biden will unveil his $2 tril stimulus package/plan in a speech later tonight at 7:15 PM ET. Please pump those green tech cuz I have an embarrassing amount in SPAC/EVs.

Until today, there were no options available higher than 40calls. If you look at this image you will see an astounding amount of calls were purchased on the first day that these options were made available. In total they represent 480 million dollars worth of calls. This could easily trigger a squeeze to 47. With some luck, we can hit the 55 calls of which there are an astounding number. If this happens, the sky is the limit. 480M$ represents nearly 20% of the total GameStop market cap. As a final note, most shorts have NOT yet been margin called, we can do this Game gang.

Could GME shorts be hedged up with calls?,0.75,"Think about it: everyone always asks ""why didn't the shorts cover at $3?"" From the outside it looks like pure greed but as another one of the endless GME posts pointed out, these institutions aren't fucking stupid. They don't just 💎👐 their profits and watch them go to 0 like we do. And if they actually were getting fucked, they would have covered a while ago.

My theory is that when GME went to its lows, the shorts essentially saw this as a gift from the gods. They were expecting GME to go to 0 in the next 5 years, not in 1. So they most likely saw that there was immense upside and instead of simply covering, they leveraged themselves to the tits with calls just like u/deepfuckingvalue, essentially creating a hedge for their short position. They knew GME would have a rebound in this covid economy and they basically shilled it on retail to make fat stacks. Once their calls print, they will own millions of shares which they can use to cover. After seeing Cohen's plan for the company they might even short it the fuck down again.

Analysis of Massive Potential GME Forced Selling Friday (Up to 1/3 of total float),0.81,"There was some action in another thread about this, but thought I'd summarize my math on possible dealer/MM forced selling friday. **At present, it appears that  as many as 15.3m shares of GME will get dumped between now and the close Friday, and GME has float of 46m shares. This is essentially the reverse of yesterday, when I believe banks/dealers/mms essentially bought a good fraction of that, or maybe even a bit more using longer option exposures, on the way up, causing the huge melt up we saw.**

**I'm not saying GME is a bad or good stock, and I'm not saying Cohen's plan is good or bad. I'm not saying there isn't a future further short squeeze. I'm just saying that a massive block of selling may occur Friday on dealer hedging behaviors. And I am saying congratulations to all the longs who made a ton of money here (I certainly did earlier).**

I went through and counted all of the open interest of all options expiring on GME Friday - calls and puts - and then multiplied that by deltas when GME stock at $40. It's changed a bit since then. I used yahoo finance data, which may be slightly stale and cause some inaccuracy here.

Assumption: 90% of all calls and puts have a dealer on the short side hedging. If there are more named thetagang sellers, the implications are lesser, but I find it unlikely these aren't mostly dealer options.

Findings:

Assuming the 90% hedging, total shares to hedge options expiring on Friday is as follows: calls is around 15.85m shares. Total shares SHORT to hedge puts is around 525 thousand.  This means total shares or equivalents being held long by dealers/banks/mms to hedge right now JUST FOR FRIDAY (does not include longer dated options) is long 15.3m shares.

When Friday is ending, a few things happen:

1. If options are held to close, they get GME stock settled. Those won't affect price, assuming those who get the GME stock hold. But most people would not do that as option traders.
2. If you dump your massive tendie bearing options, you dump them to a dealer who in turn uses that call to neutralize their exposure, so they sell the delta exposure of your stock. If you sell a $20 call right now, a dealer is going to immediately dump 99.5 shares of GME stock.
3. OF course, if you do #2, then promptly buy new GME options, you offset some of this, but you won't offset most of it. A massively in the money call has a delta of 1, while a decently OOM call has a delta in the .1 to .3 range, which means net selling of 70 per contract , unless you buy a LOT more contracts, and options are getting more expensive. Of course, while a lot of us will roll to other GME calls, I'm sure some of you will take money out for taxes, or go buy other options on other things, or even take the put side of this trade.
4. And here's the kicker. Brokerages start forcing liquidations on these options as the close on friday approaches. If you would be out of margin compliance on the exercise of your massively appreciated options (by having a ton of GME stock and a huge negative cash balance after exercise), they'll simply force you to sell your options at the bid the MMs are offering. That then starts the cascade I just outlined in #2. You can then roll that into 3 if you want.

Be really careful here. This could entirely moon even higher next week. And there's a ton of longer dated OI I did not analyze. But Friday (if there's a lot of call monetization and thus share selling) and early through mid-day Tuesday (for those who accept stock settlement then dump it Tuesday) looks really scary in terms of dealer de-hedging, and the massive run we had these past few days looks like a gamma squeeze where these banks/dealers/mms had to accumulate shares to hedge all of their short options. Remember, there’s a huge gamma ramp in the 20s and low 30s that shot this up yesterday. That same ramp can shoot this stock down too.

**This is one of the largest dealer unwinds we've seen in any stock, and really anything could happen. More importantly, there's not currently a lot of gamma ramp above this, in part because it was hard to buy options at higher strikes until basically today. The fact the stock is levitating up today is in part because there’s no share supply due to how much dealers are holding to hedge options. It is also because near the money options are gradually converging on delta of 0 or 1, and most are in the money, so they are converging on delta one, and thus the net effect is slight to moderate buying today and early tomorrow, until people start selling those calls to not auto-exercise.**

edit after close thursday: looks like delta convergence of ITM options to 1 did drive a little bit of the same effect as yesterday, which means that dealer inventory probably increased slightly from when I wrote this.

edit 2 after close: I think you could see morning meltup as those options continue to hit 1 delta from .9 or whatever. I do think the selling should pick up by half way through. One commenter pointed out the surge in oct had similar mechanics on the option expiration, which started around noon NY time. I will likely exit much of my position if I don't see selling tomorrow, and exit the rest if I don't see it early tuesday. If this thesis plays out, I'd flip long at some point, but probably not until near end of day tomorrow.

Edit 3 - 1 1/4 hour after open Friday - looking like what I said though the market being on fire is pushing. I suspect a lot of the initial selling was dealers de hedging those 45, 50 and 55 calls they sold yesterday when open was weak and now we are sliding into puts that need hedging. May accelerate as people monetize calls, though people will be selling day calls too - but those are much smaller positions than the old calls. I am honestly surprised to see it down this much already.

Edit 4 - 2 hours to close. Has been flat around -10% for a while. Big selloff most likely to occur from here to close. If it doesn't, it means the buying force at play here + rolling of options offset enough of this. I won't be holding my puts into next week, and am red at this price level from buying too early yesterday. I'll be green at -15% though.

Edit 5 - 1.5 hours to close, I don't like how this is moving, so I exited my positions. Took a 15.5k loss. I may re-try next week if Tuesday is adequately green.  Shares avail to short went up a bunch (1m from one site, so its more than that) so it looks like some short covering was supporting today and absorbing this. There's also a lot of NTM call volume for next week, so presumably some of these ITM calls being dumped are being rolled. We may still see surprises in final 30 mins, but I'm less hopeful now. It seems like the dealer rebalance happened to a degree, but the lower volume than expected suggests the call rolling stopped a lot of it.

Edit 6 - 10 min to close- According to twitter (not 100% sure if true), IBKR Schwaab and others are removing or greatly tightening margin allowance on GME stock, which is going to cause some forced selling when they do. I estabslihed a new in the money put position into next week, despite taking a bath today. The fact they are doing it means they are very nervous about their risk management of those positions in their brokerages, which implies it's held by a lot of retail accounts on margin. That's a different thesis than this, but that makes me more OK with holding risk over the weekend since that's forced selling to an extent tuesday, that should crush some of the calls that are hedged into next week.

Edit 7 - At the close. Didn't play out in the end as violently as I thought, though below my 'bull' case of $37 ($35.50), but above my expected value of like $32. Stock out-performed what I thought it would with -11% down.  Short borrow fees went down, shares avail went up today, so at least a million shares of short covering happened today, maybe 2 or 3 million. Option volume was high, it appears a lot of calls were rolled into near the money options for next week, which would tend to reduce the amount of selling dealers need to do on exits this week. We thus have a big gamma ramp going into next week, so the stock will be volatile again. Eventually, there won't be enough new money to move the stock up, and since people are usually mostly OTM calls, as time approaches, those get de-hedged if the stock isn't reaching them, which can be selling if the momentum doesn't continue. I ended up taking a smaller at the money put position into next week after losing 15.5k on my original position and 5k in bad day trades. Logic on next weeks trade is that it's a lot of OTM calls and a gamma ramp, and the brokers increasing margin rules will cause some forced selling of stock on Tuesday since apparently a lot of retail traders are over-extended (otherwise there wouldn't be that margin rule). I'll likely dump these if I don't see that tanking the price fast on Tuesday.

Disclaimer: I did buy deep oom puts targeting NEXT week, and would make a ton of money if this came to pass. I put in about $100k in capital mostly in Jan 22 $28 puts.  This week makes more sense, but I'd get liquidated too by my broker if GME pukes Friday, so the trade won't work. I may very well swing hard long if the sell off is furious enough then ride this up again to $40 🚀 🚀 🚀",2021-01-14 18:13:36
Best decision ever still results in worst trade of my life.,0.99,"Long story short I've been trading GME both-ways for a while with lots of success. Shorting the initial morning pop and covering later in the day. Also gone long for for periods of time when I felt a pop was coming. I believed in the short squeeze and the play but got caught holding a massive bag after Cohen announced he was joining. I definitely didn't realize how powerful the retard strength of this sub is.

Ending up covering roughly \~600kish in shares yesterday morning. Lost roughly \~300kish. Crazy to think if I somehow slept in or went on a morning run that I would have blown up my entire account and actually owed my broker money. I've gotten burned on crowded trades before and definitely learned another valuable lesson with this ordeal. Trying not to think about how much I lost and how much I could've made if I would've been long.

Congrats to the guys who killed it. I'm legit happy for you. On to the next play!

Likewise, to my fellow GameStop/GME GANG BULLS: The longer we wait, the bigger our reward. **Let me explain.**

Let's assume shorts haven't even covered yet (and many analysts say they haven't), then the bigger our initial investment capital to be multiplied to theoretical infinity, and that's not even counting our call options (juicy gamma squeeze, anyone?). Now, let's do some math.

**Assumptions:**

• Assume C(n) is 'zero point', prior to squeeze; where 'C' is initial capital, and 'n' is all the compounded multiplier *prior* to the deadly short squeeze. Basically, it's just your total capital multiplied by organic % growth. It's some king shit. Let's say that C(e) is ending capital. Remember the 'compound interest is king' worship on subs like r/investing? Well, my fellow retards, this is compound interest on fucking steroids so scientifically advanced it hasn't even been birthed yet.

• Assume days-to-cover is about 6 as per avg. daily volume and number of shares shorted needing to be unwound, under a 100% of float shorted scenario (which, in our case, is actually 250%-300%+. Who knows how that shit plays out. (I like to play conservative: positive surprise is better than negative.)) (edit: some folks say that the average volume in the past few days has risen by 'x' amount. Might be true, but it could also die down to an averaged baseline since the volume spike was more organic buying imo. Also, consider that the *current* short % of float is **260.91%\*\*\*\*** as of writing (Yahoo! Finance, Dec. 20, 2020 data). That's good for Longs, *absolutely fucking terrifying* for shorts given current circumstances. Take from that as you will.)

•Assume 50% increase in share price (SP) per day during short squeeze panic. (Even that's probably conservative, but, who knows. I'm not a fortune teller.)

Then;

**MOASS (conservative) Price Target (PT) = (SP)(1.5)\^6**

**and C(e) = C(n) x ((SP)(1.5)\^6)/SP)**

Think about that for a sec.

Now, let's assume shorts will start to cover for their **goddamn souls** by **SP=$50**. Then;

**Price Target (PT) = ($50)(1.5)\^6**

**Price Target (PT) = $569.53.\*\***

Let's stagger this down to steps by change-per-day so it's easier to visualize, following above assumptions:

>Day 0 (D0): $50 (+0%, zero point)  
>  
>Day 1 (D1): $75 (+50% from D0) = 1.5-bagger  
>  
>Day 2: $112.50 (+50% from D1) = 2-bagger  
>  
>Day 3: $168.50 (+50% from D2) = 3-bagger  
>  
>Day 4: $253.125 (+50% from D3) = 5-bagger  
>  
>Day 5: $379.6875 (+50% from D4) = 7-bagger  
>  
>Day 6: $569.53125 (+50% from D5) = 11-bagger

**Literally an 11-bagger in a matter of 6 days by conservative day-over-day 'squeeze' growth estimates.** (edit: I'm adding a variation factor, or randomness factor as I want to call it, of +-$200 on the 11-bagger mark, just to cover our bases. I've read more on other people's MOASS PTs, and the 11-bagger seems to be on the upper end (I will not retract the PT though, and I am confident in the mathematical power of exponential compounding, esp. in this historical short squeeze data on GME). I enjoy the fact, however, that by consensus, we all agree on the whopping potential multiples this short squeeze can generate.**\*\*\*\*\*\***) (edit: There's been comments about the massive sell-walls at $420.69, hence, it could curtail any share price growth beyond that point. If it even reaches that point, that would be fucking hilarious. Even funnier at $694.20.)

**$TSLA performance 1-yr to date is an 8-bagger.** (Shoutout to our TSLA brothers, we love you and shit. GME gang will join you in tendie-land soon.)

The legendary **VW Short Squeeze** was a little under 5-bagger over the course of several days, and even then,

**I will quote DOMO Capital\*\*\* on a recent example:**

>it took [$APRN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24APRN&src=cashtag_click) 3-4 days to squeeze.  
>  
>Day 1: Up as high a 86%, closed up 68%  
>  
>Day 2: Up as high as 96% closed up 71%  
>  
>Day 3: Up as high as 198% closed up 148%  
>  
>Day 4: Up as high as 77% closed down 12%  
>  
>$2.25 to $28.84 at peak  
>  
>That was without >100% SI

**You read that right. That was without >100% SI. And in this example, $APRN was a 13-bagger (+1281.77%) over the course of 3-4 days.** **Meanwhile, our hypothetical GME scenario above yielded an 11-bagger (+1100%) after 6 days, on (imo) conservative day-over-day short squeeze spikes of 50%.** I know that +1000%+ looks almost impossible on paper. Sure, maybe as an isolated, singular event. But stretch that over to multiple days with compounding interest overwhelmingly in your favor, and you can get there in no time (if you're still confused about that, re-read the visualized step-by-step change-per-day above). That's why you can have small initial capital amounts grow into millions of dollars after many years of passive investing, but, that's for r/investing to talk about.

[+7&#37; YoY index investing growth until age 65? We don't do that here. 1000&#37;+ or bust bitch](https://preview.redd.it/hkz8itzf3db61.jpg?width=1046&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74375f3871fc0664f10d154d404a03eae1f6a339)

GME right now is like a lottery ticket, where the statistical impossibility of winning it big has been replaced by the function probability of time, where time decay is in your favor; inversely proportional to shorts. They have to cover eventually, and the water boils hot by the second. 

What catalysts can be 'surpriseful' enough to lead shorts to cover to their deaths, you might ask? Who knows. What I do know, however, and something which has NOW BEEN PROVEN to be validated by (at the very least) recent price action alone, is that sweet sugar daddy Ryan Cohen and our CHWY daddies Alan Attal and Jim Grube *know what they're doing.* Who knows what kind of walls they'll be breaking in these coming days, weeks, or months. And each and any of them can become the flashy red nuclear button to send this bitch running. (edit: Jim Cramer had a segment on Mad Money today about the ripe-ness of GME to fucking SQUEEZE INTO MOASS.\*\*\*\*\* You read that right: GME + MOASS potential + CRAMER. He also seems to love WSB, and probably jacks off to our gains. Hi Cramer! See link below: thanks to u/CPTHubbard for sharing the link.)

Then again, I might be retarded as fuck, take these assumptions with a grain of salt. Long live WSB, and long live GME gang.

**Bonus:** ""but u/fieryskyes, how do I know when the tip has topped?""

*My* answer: Who knows. Feel free to set yourself a limit sell, or not. Just remember that MM's and many other advanced traders can see your limit sells (e.g. $420.69) via Level II data. If (and that's an if) and when the MOASS starts to happen, you will know. WSB will be going apeshit about it. With regards to my own *personal* strategy, I'll be watching the price spike *actively* over the span of the days it squeezes. No limit sell, no stop loss.. I'd rather see the price peak to the highest peak, knowing it has maxed out, and then catch it as it freefalls, than SELLING too early without having even seen the peak yet. Seeing the glorious green dildo peak is ejaculatory enough for me, and I'll be ready to unwind shortly \[pun intended\] as it falls. *But then again,* that's just my personal preference on the play. There could be better plays, in which I'd be open to exploring.

**TL;DR: Under the assumptions written above, GME MOASS Price Target is potentially an 11-bagger on conservative estimates over a 6-day period, and the short squeeze (reportedly) hasn't even begun yet. GME right now is like a lottery ticket, where the statistical impossibility of winning it big has been replaced by the function probability of time, where time decay is in your favor; inversely proportional to shorts. Join now, or die in FOMO forever.**

\*\*\*\*\*\*: possibly final edit: I've been browsing through other MOASS Price targets, and seems like my range is up the upper end so far. For that reason, I'm including a variation range of +-$200 on the 11-bagger mark, to account for randomness, and just to cover our bases. The key thing to note is that MOASS price targets are in whopping multiples of current SP. I will not retract the 11-bagger PT, as it just shows the power of exponential compounding interest in a once-in-a-lifetime MOASS scenario, given our current data on GME and its boiling rocket fuel.

STOP SLEEPING ON AMD,0.95,"AMD is currently trading at a 10% discount thanks to the Intel bulls (AMD bears) who believe their new CEO can make their stock move - except this loser couldn't even make his previous company (VMW) move during the biggest bull market of our time. VMW has traded side ways for the last 52 weeks! (wtf)

Just days ago AMD hit an all time high of $99, today it's at $90. 
I'm sure some of you remember the massive rocket ship 🚀 SuBae gave us back when everyone was praying to her before their mother tucked them in at night. Well, it's time to start dreaming of Dr. Lisa Su again because the only place AMD is going IS UP until at least until 2024. While Intel are crying about getting hulk smashed by SuBae, AMD keeps stealing massive market share, and the corona has increased the need for computers so much that TSM (the foundry who makes the chips for AMD) are at max capacity and will be for several years. The only other company that can compete with TSM is Samsung who are also at max capacity. Meanwhile, Intel's fabs are several years behind.

I know you guys don't like to read so here's the CliffsNotes version:

* AMD growing at rocket speed🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

* 20% of server market by EOY (Currently at 10%, up from 1% 2 years ago)

* Notebook market share growing by 50% (Lisa just announced this at CES a few days ago)

* Most products are constantly sold out - just look at all the people crying over at r/AMD and all those people that still can't buy PS5's. 

* AMD powers both XBOX and PS. PS5 sales topped 3.4 million units in the first 4 weeks. Sony has had to increase production by 50%!

* TSM are trying to build new fabs asap to increase production of CPU's - Today they reported a 23% increase in profits.

* PC shipments climb 13% in 2020, marking highest increase in a decade.
 
* The gaming PC market is set to grow 25% by 2024

* Intel's competitive advantage (their own fabs) is so useless that they are trying to buy space at the already full TSM fab. 

* Intel are 2-3 years behind AMD. 

* r/intel = 205,452 users, r/amd = 765,440 (hmmmmmm)

* Lisa Su always delivers the promised numbers every quarter 

Oh yeah, and mad lad **CRAMER** [just told everyone to load up during this buying opportunity.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/intel-shakeup-creates-buying-opportunity-in-amd-jim-cramer-says.html)

Right now the boomers who don't understand the PC market are shorting AMD and buying up Intel just because it's the only name the recognise from the dinosaur age. These are the same losers who just got wrecked by GME. Let's show these fools again. **Stop letting boomers control the OG WSB rocket ship!**

**TL;DR -** AMD is an undervalued sleeping giant currently on sale. Most analysts predict $110, some $120. [235/384 people](https://www.reddit.com/poll/kwthxy?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=AMD_Stock&utm_content=t3_kwthxy) on r/amd_stock believe it will be $150+ in Jan 2022.

"Short PSA: During a short squeeze, don't play the lotto (OTM Weeklies)!",0.94,"TL;DR: Weekly Calls during a short squeeze cost 60-90% of what the same calls for a few months cost. If you're gambling on the stock going ballistic, making 1000% on ATM monthlies is the way to go versus spending almost as much trying to hit 10000%.

&#x200B;

I just want to shout out /u/MikeThePutz for being the original short squeeze maestro during the BYND meat days of 2019. If you were out of the womb back then, you would have seen the same circumstances as we see now with GME; every single call that you can buy is going to cost several hundred dollars. Here's a chart of the BYND squeeze from May to August:

https://preview.redd.it/njj0i7t0sbb61.png?width=1844&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbed1890ff88d7503988f9fe6b8bcbd932ee4c23

I'm not saying the same huge drop in GME is necessarily going to happen, but if you buy 1/22 calls and it does, you are going to lose all your money.

I'm going to repeat that because you didn't hear me the first time: **IF YOU BUY WEEKLIES DURING A SHORT SQUEEZE YOU ARE ASKING TO LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY**

For an example I'm going to use the 1/22 35c and the 4/16 35c:

https://preview.redd.it/7j64t74vsbb61.png?width=1077&format=png&auto=webp&s=97ae2396a28828fc8c059b9a9906c6e87eec7ce2

As you'll see, you're paying damn near 70% for 5 trading days of expiry as 65 trading days! And you get the same amount of delta but with a fuck ton of IV to dick you down

GME, has the equivalent of 7x 4 for 4$s. Extrapolating the data, we can easily see how GME is 28X tendies.  When multiplied times 4 gives us a price target of $112 per share.

$GME: Learning from the journey,0.82,"Hello brothers and sisters in GameStop. My sermon today is an examination of why some of our fellow autists have become millionaires while I continue to live in a cardboard box. 

I was an early-ish follower of the $GME faith, but when tribulations came my faith was shaken. I still went to church, but my heart wasn't in it like those we look up to. We must reflect on our failures to grow as followers in Cohen. 

This testimony is long (sorry). I needed to force myself to actually examine things so I don't fuck up the next opportunity for tendies. This is my penance.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**: Retard examining why I made small gains off $GME despite being in months ago. I keep track of all my trades. $GME has been a rollercoaster of emotions and opportunities in a very short time, so lots to learn. 

&#x200B;

# Takeaways

1. I never truly committed or believed in the position. It remained a small % of my portfolio and I was always hedging because being down even a couple % hurt, let alone -20% swings. To find 20X return you have to invest in companies that have significant uncertainty (and volatility). That  means persuasive arguments on both sides. If you lack conviction you won't be able to stay in.  
2. Follow those charts and imagine you don't know where we end up. Put yourself in that moment. Holy fuck. **Am I buying the dip or catching a falling knife**? This has been bumpy and uncertain. We can all pretend this was a sure thing, it wasn't. It still isn't.
3. We've all heard Fear and Greed rule the market. Its one thing to say that. Its another to feel it and observe it in yourself. My mood on $GME has flipped from ""This motherfucking boomer CEO is burning all my $"" to ""Fat FIRE, this year, motherfuckers"" 4 times in as many months. I felt intense emotions (still feeling them during the current run). W/o acclimating to balance that out I think its impossible to make good decisions. 
4. I'm very glad I kept detailed notes on what I was doing. Write down your thoughts and reason for taking a position. Revisit these. We're all retards. But that doesn't mean we can't learn our bad habits and improve. I'm stunned looking back by how often I was paralyzed and couldn't take action. 
5. None of this was obvious. There were strong cases that the business was undervalued. It was a good bet. But it was a bet. (Blasphemy you say? The true prophet, RoaringKitty said on yesterday's stream that as June turned into July and August and no PE firm or other investors stepped in he began to wonder if he was right). The business was bleeding cash, it just wasn't hemorrhaging like bears thought. The management is out of touch. COVID could have been worse. The broader market could have sold off, offsetting anything $GME did (and probably making sentiment even worse). 
6. I believe at $30-$40 the core business is reasonably priced and the value thesis is proved out. There are other stories (short squeeze and the business transformation) that remain. IMO these are far less certain, but in this market a good story might be worth $100. 

# Charts + comments

[Entering via CCPs](https://preview.redd.it/kyuu2rh4rab61.png?width=2769&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ce9dc1dc310e756ff294b88061557fad2726a50)

I hear about $GME. The business model of buy kids consoles for pennies on the dollar seems lucrative, video game sales in general are good, but COVID + things going digital are big question marks. The stock is up a lot from lows, but only liars buy at the low and sell at the high. Still seems reasonable, I sold weekly $10P (felt good about this).  Put premiums were good (3.6% for 3 days) and I figured I could get write for a couple weeks before being assigned. 

Also, picked up some 1/15/21 $30C (retard FOMO, I even noted as much ""Getting in w/o doing full research based on Burry and Ryan Cohen + extremely high short interest. Very speculative at this point. Console refresh upcoming + GME while not vibrant is healthy balance sheet wise"").

[Assigned... Ok, time to wheel](https://preview.redd.it/8746byjkrab61.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=c210980355934995c97ea8151066f07a9d449b48)

Assigned on the first set of Puts. Fuck. Down 3-ish%. No worries, I'll collect more of that sweet premium w/ CCs at $10. 

&#x200B;

[MSFT News hits](https://preview.redd.it/8x1iv0kesab61.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=791ec4aec2a3929bc6622a3427539f11c6a0c42a)

MSFT news released. No real details. Some people are mocking it saying it is just an agreement to buy MSFT products. Yeah, that's one way to read it. (We're 3 months past this date and still don't know the specifics...). Missed a 40% jump that settled around 20%. The wheel gave me a 7% return instead. $30C bounced up. Continue to do option writing strategies (purchasing for CCs or near the money Puts). Unsure whether I'm being an idiot and should just go long, but things feel speculative and I like the idea of generating returns now (even lower) to buffer against the downside. 

&#x200B;

We rocket again! Can't even remember their being news. Shorts are getting squeezed for sure. I'm missing out.  I buy 1000 shares at $15.06. I kind of feel retarded so I hedge it by selling CCs against half the position. Weekly at first, but then $16C 6 weeks out. 

$30C still have massive bid/ask spreads but have gone up nicely (150%)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d11ov8twuab61.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=c822ab096d7312bde938adfac6de41ed6ffe2b16

Jesus fucking Christ. So glad I sold those longer dated CC, but still took a bath. Really wondering if I'm just an idiot buying in at the top. I also really start considering longer dated $10 Puts (20% for 2 months was available), but pussy out. 

I dump the $30C as well on the way down ($1k profit off a $1k position)

Cohen sends a letter to the board. Market doesn't seem to care. The embarrassment of holding GameStop grows in me. I do a bit of buying to sell ATM CC's. 

&#x200B;

Shit runs up again. Intense FOMO. Feeling like an idiot for not buying when things went back to \~10. I'm doing the exact opposite of what you're supposed to do. A week ago I thought $GME was shit. Now I want to back up the truck... I held off buying at $13 (It'll pull back), $14, $15 (c'mon). I finally buy at 500 shares @ $16.01, 300 shares at $17.22, 700 more at $19.10. Watching this run up while holding a small position is ruining my Thanksgiving holiday...

Feeling like a sucker I hedge w/ CC's. IV is thru the roof going into the Earnings call. I expect some detail on the MSFT deal. Hopefully the terms they got were good. Ideally they talk about similar deals w/ Sony and Nintendo (They got Reggie on the board, that's got to be a layup, right?). 

&#x200B;

[Sherman gives a terrible CC](https://preview.redd.it/o8xq3fmiwab61.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d93203eea9a8e1a1ed17f6087cffaa7f22e3dd9)

Jesus. The numbers weren't that bad, but it'd be hard to shit the bed more if he tried. 

\- No earnings guidance

\- No partnership deal details

\- $100M in possible share dilution via a Shelf offering. 

\- No discussion of Cohen or other large holders who have presented suggestions for a turnaround (but we got ""Omnichannel"" boys!)

I go from feeling like a moron for not having more to feeling dumb for holding any of this POS. How is this stock going to go up when the management has its head up its ass? I'm fucked. Holiday #s are the next big news item and these idiots will downplay them. Fuck. FUCK!

&#x200B;

[Cohen ups to 13.1&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/ubwu5lkbyab61.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffb32464ea1644732caba3752a03921d2cc1a55a)

There was serious talk of Cohen walking away. He had a low enough cost basis to make a good profit.  He re-affirms and ups his share. 🚀 back on the menu. Why don't I have more of this? I missed another golden opportunity...

&#x200B;

[Random drop](https://preview.redd.it/u398ihwbzab61.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce4aa76f4c7b0fb3dd3cd19cb6b7a14fb81f8de5)

I sold some CCPs near the top, pretty far out of the money. Would have been assigned at $18. Instead, I close the position for a small profit on the premium, don't want to up my $GME holdings. Already feels like too much exposure. 

&#x200B;

Cohen and the board were added Monday. Mild move up (10%). TBH I'd barely processed that news when the 60%+ day occurred. 

I had 1500 shares w/ only 3 CC's written against them. Proceeded to sell CC's (8 contracts) at $25, $26, $29. I was expecting the move to stop at 15-30%. Obviously misjudged that but that's been my experience. I also really wanted to do the smart thing for once and take profits (relax, not selling shares, just writing contracts) on the upswing vs my normal retarded MO of buying high hoping to sell higher. 

Was eye-balling selling the $40C when it hit 600IV ($6 premium for 3 days...), but by that point I was so gunshy (every call I'd written to that point was blown by) and convinced this was going to infinity. I'm resisting the urge to buy, but its hard. Instead I sold some CCP's at $15k worth of $25 (4% return over 3 days). Those 1/15/21 $30C, even w/ massive theta decay, are selling for 3X what I got. 

As confident as the market re-affirming my beliefs makes me $GME still isn't turning a profit yet. Details around the turnaround are scarce. I'll ride it up since my cost-basis is much lower, but I think I missed the opportunity for obscene gains.",2021-01-14 14:41:41

#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/14/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-14-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Wall Street looks to start another mixed session

> * Dow and S&P 500 futures rose but Nasdaq futures dipped slightly Thursday, a day after a mixed session left all three stock benchmarks less than 1% from their record highs. Shortly after Wednesday’s market close, the House impeached President Donald Trump for inciting an insurrection at the Capitol last week. Premarket stock reaction was relatively muted because the House vote was widely expected.

> * Investors will also focus on the Labor Department’s weekly jobless claims data at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists are calling for a rise to 800,000 in weekly new filings for unemployment benefits.

> * Delta Air Lines cut in half its cash burn and narrowed its losses in the fourth quarter as the coronavirus pandemic drove the carrier to its worst year ever. Shares in the premarket rose more than 1%.

> * Shares of BlackRock were higher by more than 1% Thursday after the New York-based firm reported better-than-expected profits and revenue in the fourth quarter. BlackRock’s assets under management surged to a record $8.68 trillion at the conclusion of the quarter.

*****

> # 2. 10 Republicans vote for Trump impeachment

> * Ten Republicans joined all of the House Democrats in a 232-197 vote to impeach Trump. GOP Sen. Mitch McConnell, majority leader until Georgia certifies the Democrats’ two runoff election wins, said the Senate won’t start Trump’s trial until Tuesday. That’s one day before President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration, which is expected to be locked down with unprecedented security. In a video released Wednesday, Trump sent his clearest condemnation yet of last week’s Capitol riot. However, he took no responsibility and made no mention of impeachment.

*****

> # 3. Biden to unveil Covid mitigation plan

> * Biden is expected to unveil Thursday a coronavirus action plan, centering on a mass vaccination program and closer coordination among all levels of government. The Biden plan comes as the U.S. battles another surge in Covid cases and deaths.

> * Mainland China on Thursday reported its first Covid death since May as authorities try to control a spike in cases just outside of Beijing. The flare-up unfolds as a WHO team arrives in Wuhan, where the coronavirus was discovered in late 2019, to investigate the origins of the virus alongside Chinese scientists.

*****

> # 4. J&J’s one-shot coronavirus vaccine safe: Study

> * Johnson & Johnson’s one-dose Covid vaccine is safe and appears to generate a promising immune response in young and elderly volunteers, according to trial data published in the New England Journal of Medicine. J&J is expected to release results from its 45,000-person phase three trial later this month, which could then lead to a third vaccine approved for emergency use in the U.S. by the FDA. J&J is using the same technologies behind its Ebola vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna employed a new approach for their respective two-shot vaccines.

*****

> # 5. Petco, Poshmark set to debut on Nasdaq

> * Two initial public offering are debuting on the Nasdaq on Thursday. Petco priced its IPO at $18 per share, above the expected range of $14 to $17, valuing the pet products retailer at nearly $4 billion. Poshmark priced its IPO at $42 per share, above the expected range of $35 to $39. The offering gives the online secondhand goods seller an initial valuation of more than $3 billion.

"Stock Market News for Today | GME Squeeze | BABA, INTC, TGT, AFRM & other Stock Market News [01-14]",0.98,"**GameStop short squeeze is ON! Alibaba continues to push into the EV world. Intel spikes while AMD & TSM suffer. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news!**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market finishing mixed, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/qybhmjC) gaining .43%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/YL4XS6m) also gaining .23% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/YTFwLcx) lost just 8 points to close out the day. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/0r28dsT) dropping almost 5% again, continuing the downtrend after that huge spike with the Georgia elections, as it sits at similar levels to the ones before Christmas.

Despite the positive gains for the broad stock market SP500, [OVERALL](https://ibb.co/PrDh7DD), we saw about 57% of the companies declining yesterday, with most of them trading below average volumes, as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average still sits over 70%, which is pretty high. Yesterday we saw 6 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/wJH4B8C) finish in the green with Real Estate and Utilities posting gains of more than 1% while the laggards were Energy, Industrials and Materials, as we saw large-cap growth companies finally [OUTPERFORMED](https://ibb.co/kKtRY96) for once in 2021, with small & mid-caps giving up some of the big gains they have posted in this short year, though, Large-Cap Growth companies are still underperforming by 3% compared to the next factor group in 2021.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/Ms0qkCh) from yesterday, which shows pretty mixed results as expected, with most of the big tech companies posting small gains like Apple, Amazon, Google, Netflix and the rest of the bunch, with Alibaba posting a 4% gain after some EV news popped up and Intel also gaining almost 7% and pushed the rest of the Semiconductors down with TSM and AMD both down over 3%.

We also got a lot of economic data yesterday as the US [DEFICIT](https://ibb.co/QXXDBrc) fell by $2B to $143B in December compared to the previous month, but is up 10 fold from the $13B deficit from the same period in 2019, and this doesn’t even include any of the $900B stimulus packaged that passed late in December, while the December consumer price [INDEX](https://ibb.co/n1Jr9G2) increased by 0.4% m/m and Core CPI also increase by 0.1%, coming in-line with expectations, as the Atlanta FED business inflation expectations [ROSE](https://ibb.co/t2v98jw) to 2.2% in January compared to December, though sales and profit margins compared to normal, decreased since the last month, while one of the FED’s Vice Chairs [RESTATED](https://ibb.co/WtNxQKM) that the FED won’t raise rates until the average long-term inflation stands at 2% for a year.

[Today](https://ibb.co/C79879d) we get lots of important economic data with Jobless numbers in the early morning, which are expected to come around the same numbers as the previous week and end with the Money Supply and FED Balance Sheet while the stock market will also turn its eyes to see what the FED Leader Powell announces in terms of the FED keeping the money printer going, and of course to see what Biden announces about a further stimulus packaged that is expected to be as big as $2T.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Intel](https://ibb.co/9bHNxrx) spiking yesterday after the company decided on a change in leadership, this move put some selling pressure on rival companies like TSM, AMD & others, but I think this is more of a “hype move” right now. Intel has still fallen behind it’s competition and it will take massive Capex and R&D investments to catch up, so the selloff in other players should rather be a buying point, especially for AMD.

We also saw [Target](https://ibb.co/Phk4N4s) reporting huge comp sale increases with a 4.3% increase in traffic and a massive 12.3% increase in the average ticket, as comparable digital sales more than doubled. 

We also saw, their same-day services post an impressive growth of almost 200%, as they remain one of the best plays in the consumer discretionary sector, as 95% of their sales were fulfilled by their 1600 store that are within 10miles of ¾ of the US population.

Also, guys, these small cap companies keep on giving me reasons to come back to the same points I have been making in the past weeks, with company after company issuing shares, with the latest ones being [Nano](https://ibb.co/qDRKJ7Y) Dimension which are diluting their shares by about 20% while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/27StT0c) has also increased their stock offering by another 300.000 shares.

While in another kind of news we saw [GameStop](https://ibb.co/pLMSXrb) soar yesterday finishing the day up over 57%, after a huge short squeeze pushed the stock up as high as 90% at one point. This has happened after GameStop has [PUSHED](https://ibb.co/F3S2XTT) for a change in leadership with plenty of experience in the e-commerce and online marketing world, with 3 veterans from Chewy, which has been an impressive performer in the online e-commerce business. The [STOCK](https://ibb.co/y8XVnd7)  Is up another 20% in pre-market right now as the short squeeze keeps increasing the pressure on the bears.

We also saw [Alibaba](https://ibb.co/vjKdwKW) making a couple of headlines yesterday, which helped push the stocks 4% higher, after the Wall Street Journal reported that the US is expected to continue to allow investments in Alibaba, Baidu & Tencent, while also continuing their charge into the [EV](https://ibb.co/0tVsJSS) world, with a new electric sedan that features wireless charging in cooperation with China’s state owned SAIC Motor. This is their latest push into the EV world, as Alibaba is also an investor in Xpeng. This news, might help the stock see a recovery, that could be boosted if Jack Ma finally appears and the Ant Group IPO eventually receives the green light.

And one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/Z8RSWQL) is that Affirm went public yesterday and started trading at just over 90$, more than 80% above the IPO price, as the IPO mania keeps on pushing any recent IPO to big pops on the first day of trading, but unfortunately, retail investors do not benefit from this, as the actual return for people who manage to buy right at the open price, is under 10% while also risking a severe drop in the next days. Hopefully more companies will move to direct listings IPOs which will allow retail investors to get part of the action, which will benefit most of the people, not just the “big players” who get in at much lower prices.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/T8wRNxc) Markets are in the green while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/LkrrWtc) are also pointing to a good open.

GME 13/01 price movement analysis,0.97,"  

The company is solid fundamentally so who cares about fundamentals now.

## Price movement

· Up to 39 dollars within the first two hours of trading.

· Sharp dip to 30 dollars.

· Consolidated a bullish pennant at 32 dollars. Seems to be a strong floor at 31 dollars.

· Up 5% intraday (17% as of 1031 GMT).

## Price movement causes

### 9am to 12pm

· Enormous volume buying the stocks. Total volume on 13/01 was 140mil total orders \[1\] through the whole day which is 20 times greater than the average 7mil daily volume. Leads to very volatile price movements.

· Large institutional buying, Blackstone and Vanguard have massive positions in GME and likely bought more yesterday to force the short squeeze, retail investors can’t fund that volume of shares.

· Market Makers got gamma squeezed massively. During the entire run up in the first three hours all call options with a strike price below 39 became increasingly in the money which leads to a large increase in delta. At the start of yesterday, a 1/15 $25 call had a delta of ≈0.3-0.4, by the end of the day the delta would be 1. This meant that the market makers would have to buy an additional 70 shares per call option they sold to keep themselves net neutral rather than net short. This created a positive feedback loop during the first hours as more calls became in the money and market makers had to hedge more leading to a subsequent increase in price.

· Likely some shorts covering their positions, there wasn’t the volume to mean that they fully covered their positions, if they did try to cover their shorts in 3 hours it would have led to a far greater price movement \[2\].

### 12PM to 12:20PM

· Likely that Markets makers switched to selling shares rather than buying shares to stop the gamma squeeze. To stop the positive feedback loop of the gamma squeeze market makers switched to selling shares rather than buying more to force the price down and reduce the delta on as many calls as possible. This can be seen by the large selling volume at the start of the dip.

· Additional short pressure to stop an infinity squeeze. There was an additional 48 million short volume yesterday \[3\], which would most likely be short term short positions from Melvin capital to push the price down and stop the price movement seen in the first 3 hours.

· Profit taking. Due to the large amount of retail investors in GME there would have been a large amount of profit taking once the euphoria of the initial pop wore off.

### 12:30PM to 1pm

· Shorts maybe unwinding their 1/15 $25 Put positions and covering their short positions while the price was stable.

· Additional buying after the dip, decreasing volume as time goes on.

### 1Pm to close

· Price consolidating in the $31 to $35 range, Day traders taking advantage of volatility in the price, even though the movements during this time were small compared to the first 3 hours the share price was still jumping up and down 10%, making it attractive for day traders.

· Large buy and sell walls set at $31 and $34 dollars keeping the share price in this range.

· General balance in buy and sell orders, if shorts did cover any of their positions during this time it would have been a very small volume.

## Conclusions and outlook

· Institutions and GME board are heavily invested in this stock with an increased cost basis after yesterday, the large amount of buy orders in the $25 to $30 range creates a strong support that the stock is not likely to go through again.

· The price movement was mainly caused by market makers hedging the large option flow, not shorts covering.

· Shorts used more of their fire power to keep the price down by opening additional short positions.

· Melvin still have 22915 put contracts \[4\] open which they need to close or let expire worthless.

· Given the small float of available shares at open on 13/1 (27mil) and the large short volume (75mil as of 12/01) it is unfeasible that shorts covered a significant amount of their position. There is likely at least 60mil shares short outstanding that need to be covered. This could take a week to fully unwind.

· New short data will be available on 15/01 and the exact short volume will be known.

· Up 17% intraday as of 1100GMT 14/01,this could either be short sellers creating pre market activity to cause a sell off or it could be the beginning of a second pop, time will tell. 

· It doesn’t appear that shorts have a path to profitability from here, no reason why the price should not go up more. 

This is going to moon so buy more shares.

GME iGamma Squeeze : Its just the beginning.,0.87,"*Disclaimer : I'm not into GME but Im def getting into 1/29 55C at open and here is why* : 

**GAMMA SQUEEZE**

1. The squeeze can begin when a large investor, typically referred to as a whale (*thats US*), buys short-dated call options in a frenetic pace of stocks that they typically own.

2. The banks or brokers that sell the call options will typically buy the underlying stock so that they have net exposure. The more call options the investor buys, the more shares the brokers that sold the options will have to buy to ensure they are net flat. Brokers and dealers are motivated by the commissions and do not want to hold a trade either long or short.

3. The option purchases force the dealers to buy the underlying stock, which can push the share price higher. If pulled off, this creates a positive feedback loop, thus can drive underlying stock(s) price higher for a period of time. In a roundabout way, the dealers must buy more and more of the underlying. All said and done, this is the Gamma Squeeze.

[sauce](https://www.swfinstitute.org/news/83341/what-is-a-gamma-squeeze-in-the-context-of-stock-trading)

NOW watch GME option volume/flows and open interest... what do you see ?

**TLDR: Forget the short squeeze. This is the gamma squeeze and its just the beginning. The short squeeze hasn't even started. This is a LITERAL PUMP AND DUMP: As long as /r/wallstreetbets keeps buying calls, GME will see +20% daily gains. GME 1/29 55C**

GME Options Update: Melvin Put Positions and Volume,0.98,"**TLDR: The shorts didn’t get out. Melvin Capital is only half out and there’s enough fuel to keep squeezing for days.**

On Monday I wrote a [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kvjbuk/gamestop_melvin_capital_put_positions/) on Melvin Capitals put positions being completely underwater and MM hedging, predicting upward pressure this week. Some of the math was skewed since I suck at coding but still correct enough. The top was blown off of short selling pressure and we rocketed to 91% intraday.

**Volume**

Total volume for today Jan 13th was 144,501,736, an insane 14x Avg. Vol. There was some fear going around that the massive volume of we saw today was all shorts covering and they are completely out. I believe that is quite wrong and would be surprised if +50% got out of the door. A wall of positive news came out regarding Ryan Cohen and the long term viability of the business. Telsey raised their rating to buy on Tuesday among others. Big buying blocks came from institutional investors and other hedge funds opening [long positions](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-13/house-set-for-impeachment-vote-as-republicans-break-from-trump). Other analysts were skeptical the price surge was primarily shorts covering.

**Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners**

>“There is a GameStop short squeeze, but no the squeeze is not the major force behind the price move,”  
>  
>“We will not be seeing a massive drop in shares shorted over the next few days, more like a 10%-20% drop which would mean 7 to 14 million of shares covered, which is nowhere near the almost 70 million shares traded this morning”

A huge driver in the volume today was [high frequency trading (HFT)](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2012/high-frequency-trading-behavious-and-its-impact-on-market-quality-evidence-from-the-uk-equity-market.pdf). These guys pay indexes for their order flow and front run orders to BTFD. They make millions of trades with algos faster than your FD's go to zero and make their tendies pennies at a time. With such volatile action HFT traders were certainly in the mix, front running orders and boosting liquidity. HFT doesn’t affect the actual number of Longs/Shorts since they never hold those positions in the books. They are mostly a non-factor but were padding the volume.

**Options Activity**

Melvin began exiting their 51k 24 put contract midday after the price surged. Volume on 15 JAN 24 Puts which is entirely owned by Melvin capital started with a series of block orders followed by smaller lots and another block order to end the day. Through the day they closed 28,110 contracts at $0.5-0.8. Currently, some Ivy League cuck is looking at an overall P/L of -$45 **MILLION** on their puts alone. Carry on when you finish jerking off to that loss porn.

There are still 22,915 contracts left to be dumped so they're not done losing their shirts.

**Delta Hedging**

\*\*Think about Delta as the chance an option goes ITM. Higher = closer to printing.

Market Makers aren't the Master Manipulator people make them out to be. [They provide liquidity and write all these options](https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/trading/trade-options-market-maker-16805). To avoid taking directional trades, they hedge their positions. This is called delta hedging. Delta\*# of Contracts\*100= shares needed long or short for neutral exposure. Every MM does this when you buy an option.

On Monday the Market Makers were net short due to outsized put volume. Overall MMs hedged delta exposure of about 1.4 Million shares short. A portion of the hedging is done through long OTM puts especially in a hard to borrow scenario for the stock.

After todays 60% rise, negative delta exposure went though the floor and positive exposure 🚀.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mbtwftlu9bb61.png?width=1556&format=png&auto=webp&s=691aedc57f91512859a831ac5c2790ba4e0f0729

Just to clarify, Market Makers will not and cannot buy 14 million shares and will have to hedge a portion with calls. However this change may be one of the greatest gamma squeezes of all time ([Definition for unawares](https://www.swfinstitute.org/news/83341/what-is-a-gamma-squeeze-in-the-context-of-stock-trading)) This is the ""top blowing off"" that I speculated would happen. Calls that were 0 Delta are now 0.38 and some MM is buying 38 shares or a call to hedge. This pushes the price higher.

**Shorts are still in**

There is no feasible way for all 71 million shares to have been covered with such a small float. I believe the Short Selling Analysts estimate of 7-14 million shares covered. Other violent short squeezes took multiple sessions to settle with a smaller short interest. All of the shorts are deep in the red currently with GME at 5 year highs. I believe these catalysts could push GME far higher.

**Positions**

Shares and more shares. Some 1DTE calls since I haven’t yolod in awhile

IV is quite high but this is a Casino. Higher strike calls should be added too.

Shares are the most important. Lock up the float and set those GTC orders to $420.69

Bunge $BG - The Easiest Free Money You'll Ever Make In 2021,0.93,"First post here but I have some very solid stuff on BG (Bunge) stock, and I know you guys are gonna make me big cash on GME so I'll share.

What alerted me on BG: I have a machine learning tool that predicts stock movements decently well depending on the quality of the indicators.

I was recently alerted that $BG's Forward P/E hit a low point around Jan 8.

This has happened on 10 distinct occasions since 2004 covering 866 trading days after the Forward P/E lows happened - 87% of those days after the forward P/E hit a low, the stock rose over 6 months. Chart of price movement prediction:

[https://preview.redd.it/k240kvsoo8b61.png?width=1618&format=png&auto=webp&s=192fc25ee4abfcd7890e5caea89440360a5033ba](https://preview.redd.it/k240kvsoo8b61.png?width=1618&format=png&auto=webp&s=192fc25ee4abfcd7890e5caea89440360a5033ba)

Other bonus: It has a quant rating (uses a ton of metrics to calculate if the stock is undervalued or overvalued) on Seeking Alpha of ""very bullish"" at 4.85 (stocks with very bullish quant ratings have produced *1000%+ returns* over 10 years VS 300% for the market itself), Wall Street analysts are bullish and SA analysts are bullish which is pretty rare.

[https://preview.redd.it/4sgqcls2p8b61.png?width=2776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d8bb61b7ce72d2a2bcb009464ad5074dfafb86a](https://preview.redd.it/4sgqcls2p8b61.png?width=2776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d8bb61b7ce72d2a2bcb009464ad5074dfafb86a)

It's already gone from $45 around October to $70 today, but it's just the beginning. Why?

BG is a big agro business, which is obviously not the ""trending"" stuff of the day, probably explaining why it's so undervalued. However, BG has already started paying a dividend and it's also a solid business overall. A lot of regular investors will be comfortable buying it as a long-term asset - but it's also a big YOLO play because the current market environment makes undervalued stocks like this super likely to explode.

$BG is trading at around $70, but using some fundamentals and TA I believe it will hit at the very least $80 within 3-6 months. However, given the current market environment (nonstop stock growth), I can easily see this momentum carrying it to $120-150+.

I have 2 plays here:

July calls $70

Buy standard $BG stock, hold for 6-12 months

I recommend a stop-loss at $64 for both plays, that’s what I have (corresponds to the forward P/E low).

**TLDR**: $BG is a super undervalued agro business. Machine learning models predict it has an 87% chance of rising to at least $80 within 6 months. It has a 4.85 quant rating on Seeking Alpha. A bullish trend could force the stock to rise to $100+.

**Mega lazy TLDR for retards**: $BG 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Extra chart for proof of link between low P/E and price movements:

EDIT: For those who have questions about the machine learning model - it's quite simple. It's simple a model constantly looking for correlations/links between key stock indicators and stock price. In this case, for 10 incidences of a drop in forward P/E, on average over the next 6 months following those drops, 87% of trading days resulted in an increase in stock price. Here's a P&L of the results of trading solely based on this metric since around 2004:

https://preview.redd.it/1l4l9gjz1ab61.png?width=1617&format=png&auto=webp&s=e25f6f8fd437e7a720c4c634ba2243b374191a0e

The tool that I used to gather this ML insight is called [toggle.ai](https://toggle.ai). It seems simple, but it's actually important to understand the ML models behind their recommendations to actually get some solid stuff worthy of YOLO plays. And it's important to cross-check their recommendations with other trackers like Seeking Alpha's quant rating, etc.",2021-01-14 06:15:42

GME short interest was 75.9M+ on 12 Jan according to ORTEX's estimates. It would be interesting to see what that turns out after today.,0.96,"&#x200B;

[GME short interest till 12 Jan\(export of ORTEX estimate data\)](https://preview.redd.it/92j84sffd8b61.png?width=1733&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ab7b82585bd8b08c324551cbbf66103f06ea7af)

I don't think shorts have covered much. As S3 Partners' Ihor Dusaniwsky(whose firm also specializes in such types of data) said, it was mostly due to bull mania. Still, today was the end of the first phase(or day) of the short squeeze.

Those institutional investors are smart. They would try to avoid triggering any panic related to short squeeze, they don't want another day like today, if they succeed, we will see a slow but steady rise, like TSLA. Regardless, today was a panic day.

Let's see how thing turns out.

Hear me out, value stocks have gotten shit on because the retards that make up this sub broke the system, but that might not last forever. So what if you took that million dollars(a fraction of your portfolio, you rich bitch) and invested it in the high dividend yield, super cheap turnaround tech story that is LUMN w/ DRIP and forgot about it to go eat dirt and flip weeklies for the next 25 years.

Here is what would happen:

Ending Balance

**$63,428,555.59(+6,000%)**

Avg Annual Return

**249.08%**

Annual Dividend Income

**$7,496,186.47**

RISK FREEEEEEEEEE!!!!!! Compound Interest motha fuckaaa! For real risk free, it trades at 0.52 Price to Sales. Even if it goes down your DRIP buys you more. They lay pipe(fiber). People need internet, heck you're using it now! It will be used as a 5G backhaul.

At the end of the day I know you wouldn't be able to keep your grubby little hands off this stack once $PLTR hits $100 and you need more capital to FOMO in, so at least ride the short term and buy the dirt cheap calls

MarketWatch: $GME Short Covering Far From Over,0.99,,2021-01-13 22:57:54
GME short squeeze,0.98,"Just to put some context on today's events the short squeeze has yet to actaully begin. Assuming an average short entry of $18 the short positions would roughly be underwater a billion dollars assuming they weren't frantically hedging by buying calls all day. 

Daily short volume is posted to Finra daily (http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html). 

SHORT VOLUME: 46,075,278  (53%)
TOTAL VOLUME: 86,578,862

TLDR: additional shorting was used to mitigate an immediate infinity squeeze.  Net result is short interest increased today.

"It's time for some real talk - of what you've all become, the stock of the year, and how much power you actually wield (don't worry, the TL:DR is ""Autism good"")",0.97,"Investing is my industry, though not directly Wall Street (I own a VC), and one of the studies we commissioned last year was an examination into just how much power retail investors have in an era of $0 commission trading and social media.  We also wanted some metrics on how, if any, that could counterbalance the power of the HFT machines that exploit liquidity and volume to move markets and the role of traditional hedge funds in the digital era.

&#x200B;

I'll spare a lot of the one-off items and deep examination that came back (both because you shouldn't care, plus nobody has the attention span to read 173 pages).  The summary is this:

&#x200B;

# SUMMARY HERE:

Some of you realize it, many of you don't, but you're officially a major market mover, on par with or even more powerful than HFT's in some regards because you've essentially found a way to break the system.  I've seen a lot of posts take about GME's launch and people claiming they don't understand how it happened or people who have an innate sense but perhaps don't grasp the nuts and bolts of it, but it's something you should probably get used to, and something you've been causing a while.

# Maths:

This sub has about 1.5 million subscribers.  It's estimated there's another 300,000 or so people who read it but aren't subbed to it.  It's estimated a full 1/3 of the people who read this sub don't actually invest at all, so they can be removed.  But of those of you who remain (removing outliers such as myself that would skew the numbers irrationally), conservative estimates on your AUM (assets under management) is **somewhere between 5.5 and 7 \*\*BILLION\*\* dollars**.  Which would put you in the top 4% of all hedge funds if that money were all thrown in a pool (only 7% of funds have over 1bln).  Except you have an inherent advantage in that you aren't regulated like a hedge fund and don't have to follow any rules.  You can just do whatever the fuck you please because it's funny (GME).  And the more you do it, the more powerful you become as a collective.

&#x200B;

What does this mean?

&#x200B;

# (TLDR HEREHEREHERE)

It means that, when you decide to act collectively, you can effectively overpower the machines and institutional investors and move a small or mid cap  stock in a direction the rest of the market doesn't want to take it as a herd.  And you can do it whenever you like.  Or, in the case of a large cap stock like TSLA, even though you couldn't latently overpower the market, if you decided to move in the direction of momentum (as you did last year), you effectively function analogously like putting a supercharger on an engine.

&#x200B;

# What should you do with this information?

Well, I suppose you start by giving yourself a tuggie while thinking about it.  But then understand that you've already determined 2021's stock of the year less than 2 weeks in by sheer force of will.  Just like TSLA was last year in spite of the numbers making absolutely zero fucking sense (there's no logical reason why TSLA is worth  more than every other car maker combined when they don't sell shit), you've made GME the 2021 stock of the year that you can just keep making go up and up no matter what the numbers or fundamentals say...just because you fucking want to.  As long as you guys stay in the herd and just keep holding the line, you can essentially push that stock to whatever price you damn well please (hell, this sub probably owned 6% of the company this morning).  You guys bullrushed this so hard that, at one point today, THERE WEREN'T EVEN SHARES AVAILABLE TO SHORT.  By brute force, you essentially made it so the stock HAD to go up.

&#x200B;

It's an interesting phenomena.  I myself gave it a run around Christmas and bought a bunch of 1/15 options @ 19 late last year which I just exercised today, honestly expecting them to expire worthless.  Fast forward to today, and I'm sitting on 60,000 shares of a company I don't even believe in after exercising those today.  But what I have come to believe is the power of you glorious retards, so I'm riding shotgun for this one.

&#x200B;

Just keep that in mind when you start seeing the herd here start to move in a direction.  I read a lot of comments today about people who didn't hop on the train because they didn't believe or because they pussed out, and this was an interesting test case of you dudes being able to do whatever the fuck you want when you unify, so just put on the cap and start chanting One Of Us...

PSA: 40$ is the magic short squeeze barrier and here is why (another short squeeze prediction by friday if we go beyond this number),0.97,"of course i am talking about GME for you fellow retards who did not get it by the title

however if you pay attention to the leader it's the ridiculous 40c 1/15 which is by FAR dominating the rest

let's be serious for a moment. the bears are fuked. however if we have this kind of day tomorrow or on friday they are tremendously fuked because the short squeeze will happen WAY earlier than we expected.

History lesson DD: VW & GME🚀🚀🚀,0.94,"Hey retards, first post in here. As we're all jacking off to today's gains, let's take a moment to look back at the history we're trying to re-create. Back when you all had even less hair on your balls, Porsche quietly bought up 70%+ of VW. They told the world on Sunday, Oct 26 and the day after............**🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** 

OK thanks for the history lesson, but who cares? Two takeaways

1. There were 2x considerable drops before the squeeze. Who truly has BRASS BALLS will be known here.
2. The squeezed price stayed high for several days after because the estates of the  hedge fund managers who shorted VW had to go through very complex wills to figure out WTF to do after the manager jumped out the window. The second part of that may or may not be true. 

&#x200B;

tl;dr GME has NOT squeezed yet. Buy SHARES now!  It's not too late, but this is likely your last chance. You'll have plenty of time (days) to cash out at tendie town. **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**

Our time has come but GME isn't fucking done yet. 🚀🚀🚀🚀,0.97,"It's happening. Melvin is soft sucking our tips right now. Unfortunately, he is actively trying to spit it and quit it. The real swallowing and squeezing of every last drop hasn't even begun. I have been with you bunch of retards on our worst days and you can fucking bet that I am going to be here on our best days. 

&#x200B;

First off, congratulations to those that actually had the brain power to shove taint deep into GME. You are all heroes and deserve every tendy and spoil you earned from pillaging Melvin's guts. This train isn't stopped and it hasn't even hit second gear. We are taking these bitches to the slaughterhouse and we are going to margin call them so hard that their kid's credit suffers. THE WAR IS NOT FUCKING OVER!

&#x200B;

Secondly, to all you brain dead idiots that messaged me on your lunchbreak while at your full time glory hole jobs just to say that I was retarded and you're buying puts, I hope you were lying. If not, you are likely gonna be homeless next week so get used to living in the backseat of your broken down car. I can't imagine being as stupid as you and broke as shit. We get it, you hate making money and prefer to lose it. Whatever floats your boat I guess.

&#x200B;

We can't stop, won't stop GAMESTOP. You all need to remember that shorts have not covered. Some have, maybe. Most have not. This party is just getting started. If you want to earn your wife back and make her stop seeing her boyfriend then listen here because as mentioned earlier this week, I have been giving you guys the mother fucking SCRIPT and you just have to follow it. For those that missed out on gains today, I feel you. Unfortunately, I sold my Jan 15 calls for 600 dollars just a few days ago. 100 of them. Let that sink in. While it wasn't my entire GME position, it would have changed my life. I missed out on so much money taking care of personal stuff that honestly, it's going to take a long time to recover from it. OH FUCKING WELL, I'm going to make it back and you smooth brains are going to make even more. This roller coaster isn't fucking over. Grab your cocks and socks because it's fucking money time. We have at least a week to watch these retard shorters scramble to cover their positions and we are gonna be jerking it all goddamn week while we ride our green dildos. This army is mobilized and we aren't stopping till we are at the fucking bank with all of Melvin's money. I know some of you guys are getting ""fuck you"" levels of money and I could cry I'm so proud.

Edit2: It's hard to interpret this but there are new big put positions open for 25p and 30p. So they might have rolled up the strike. But probably just digging themselves a deeper hole.

Why GME is going to $100-200 (or much higher),0.95,"So Jimbo Cramer begged today several times to GME management to issue more shares to repay their debt saying they should do it, as not doing it would be irresponsible.

So think about that for a moment. He is asking for more shares.

Why is he doing this? so that his 🌈🐻 friends could have an exit different than the short squeeze that is going to happen.

Bears are so fucked they told Jimbo to help them because they do not have a way out.

So please just 💎 ✊🏻 because price can only go higher and we will all end up making much more money. Heck u/DeepFuckingValue can even buy a fucking island if gme goes to $100.

A $100 price is in fact quite conservative as it would be a market cap of roughly 4-5 billion for a company whose revenue is going to be at least 5-6 billion in a superconsole cycle.

Papa cohen just needs to make this profitable and generate some hype for this to go to a 10-20 billion market cap, which would position gme stock on a $100-200 range.

Dow Jones:

""A long-buying tsunami ... is the primary factor for the price move,' short-selling expert from S3 says  


GameStop Corp. (GME) shares soared Wednesday in an apparent short squeeze, but one analyst who specializes in information on short selling doesn't think that's the case.  


GameStop shares surged more than 60% Wednesday -- which would be its largest one-day percentage gain ever, according to Dow Jones data --more than a week after short interest on the videogame retailer's stock exceeded the number of shares outstanding. At last check, more than 125 million shares had traded hands in the day's session, compared with a 52-week daily average volume of 6.5 million shares.  


**While GameStop has 69.8 million shares outstanding, short interest on the stock rose to 71.2 million shares on Dec. 31 from a previous 68.1 million shares, according to FactSet data.**  


On Monday, GameStop shares finished up 10% (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestops-stock-shoots-up-after-reaching-agreement-with-activist-investor-2021-01-11) after it reached an agreement with activist investor RC Ventures to add three of its members to the board, and advanced less than 0.1% on Tuesday. Also, on Monday, the company said holiday same-store sales rose 4.8% and that digital sales had jumped 309%.  


**While noting that shorts definitely were a part of the buying binge, Ihor Dusaniwsky -- the head of predictive analytics at financial technology and analytics firm S3 Partners, which specializes in analyzing data on short selling -- said he doesn't agree that GameStop's price surge was the result of a squeeze.**  


""GME's board shake-up and stronger holiday sales is causing a long-buying tsunami, which is the primary factor for the price move,"" Dusaniwsky said in emailed comments. ""While I agree that we are seeing some shorts squeezed out of their positions due to massive mark-to-market losses today, this is much like the chicken-and-egg question -- did long buying lead to short covering\\squeeze or short covering\\squeeze lead to long buying?""  


Dusaniwsky believes it's the former.  


**""We will not be seeing a massive drop in shares shorted over the next few days, more like a 10%-20% drop which would mean 7 to 14 million of shares covered, which is nowhere near the almost 70 million shares traded this morning,"" the analyst said. ""Long buyers are the primary force driving GME's stock price up. ""**  


GameStop shares have skyrocketed more than 500% in the past 12 months, compared with a 16% gain in the S&P 500 index and a 42% rise in the Nasdaq Composite Index .

$GME Gang - THERE HASN'T BEEN A SHORT SQUEEZE (yet) - Ihor Dusaniwsky,0.99,"Comments from Ihor Dusaniwsky today indicate that today was more of a sign of ACCUMULATION rather than short covering. Remember, Ryan Cohen can increase his stake up to 20% of the company and there are rumors the shelf offering might get cancelled.

Ihor Dusaniwsky commentary below:

**'A long-buying tsunami ... is the primary factor for the price move,' short-selling expert from S3 says  GameStop Corp. (GME) shares soared Wednesday in an apparent short squeeze, but one analyst who specializes in information on short selling doesn't think that's the case.**     

**GameStop shares surged more than 60% Wednesday -- which would be its largest one-day percentage gain ever, according to Dow Jones  data --more than a week after short interest on the videogame retailer's  stock exceeded the number of shares outstanding. At last check, more than 125 million shares had traded hands in the day's session, compared with a 52-week daily average volume of 6.5 million shares.**     

**While GameStop has 69.8 million shares outstanding, short interest on the stock rose to 71.2        million shares on Dec. 31 from a previous 68.1 million  shares, according to FactSet data.**     

**On Monday, GameStop shares finished up 10% after it reached an agreement with activist investor RC Ventures to add three of its members to the board, and advanced less than 0.1% on Tuesday. Also, on Monday, the company said holiday same-store sales rose 4.8% and that digital sales had jumped 309%.**     

**While noting that shorts definitely were a part of the buying binge, Ihor Dusaniwsky -- the head of predictive analytics at financial technology and analytics firm S3 Partners, which specializes in analyzing data on short selling - - said he doesn't agree that GameStop's price surge was the result of a squeeze.**     

**""GME's board shake-up and stronger holiday sales is causing a long-buying tsunami, which is the primary factor for the price move,"" Dusaniwsky said in emailed comments. ""While I agree that we are seeing        some shorts squeezed out of their positions due to massive mark-to-market losses today, this is much like the chicken-and-egg question -- did long buying lead to short covering\\squeeze or short covering\\squeeze lead to long buying?""**     

**Dusaniwsky believes it's the former.**     

**""We will not be seeing a massive drop in shares shorted over the next few days, more like a 10%-20% drop which would mean 7 to 14 million of shares covered, which is nowhere near the almost 70 million shares traded this morning,"" the analyst said. ""Long buyers are the primary force driving GME's stock price up. ""**",2021-01-13 20:42:44

A theory on why GME rose 94% today,0.87,"First off, stop hailing wsb for causing this, i believe that we make barely a drop. If not for Cohen’s activisim, we would probably be in the 10s. That said, congrats on all who were finally rewarded. 

&#x200B;

I believe that our daddy Ryan Cohen is behind this, although not purely by buying. 

&#x200B;

Firstly, notice how his tweets got more and more frequent leading up to today. 

&#x200B;

Next, compare the circumstances of today with the +25% day on 22nd - mooning on a day with no news, after news related to cohen. Note that the mooning came 1 and 2 days respectively after the news, indicating that the news wasn’t the cause. 

&#x200B;

In conclusion, Cohen, being an insider, recalled his shares, starting off the short squeeze.  This also explains how during these 2 rallies, shares available to short remained constant on iborrowdesk, indicating that those shares cannot be shorted anymore.

edit: an analyst from s3 has came out saying that this is primarily long buys driving the price up, is that common for institutions to accumulate by 60% days?",2021-01-13 20:11:53
"GME and the Past Tense, aka selling now is a fucking smoothbrain move",0.96,"I've been seeing some disturbing things in comments and the daily discussion today -- people talking about selling GME, taking their current gains and shoving them into their little piggy banks and patting themselves on the back. People talking in the past tense about the moves GME made today.

This is the biggest, dumbest, most stupidest smoothbrain move of all time.

The action on GME today was a **correction.** Market cap is currently at 2.13B (share price $33.13). GameStop made **$1.77 billion** in revenue in the **holiday season alone.**

There's really only 1 question you need to ask yourself when thinking about if you should stay in GME:

**Do you believe Ryan Cohen can turn GME around and turn it into a growing company?**

If you answered that with a yes (which you should), then I can't stress enough how stupid it is to sell today. Half of the fucking boomers out there still probably think GameStop's going to go out of business because they don't believe in daddy Cohen and his ability to print tendies for shareholders. GME will 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  

Successful, established companies trade at a P/E of like, what, 20? Walmart is 20. Amazon is 91. Shopify is 724. Verizon is 13. Bank of America is 16. EA is 31. Tesla is fucking 1621.

If you think Ryan Cohen can turn GameStop around into a profitable, growing company, you should see that the real upside of all this shit isn't a 60% leap, or, fuck it, even a 100% leap today -- this thing's got long term value. We'll see the share price fucking triple when the market at large sees RC get these guys on track. Fucking hold that shit.

Paper handing isn’t just selling for a loss,0.98,"In this case paper handing is selling GME today.

Just a friendly reminder that this stock is worth $50 on fundamentals alone without even accounting for what Cohen brings to the table. The short interest is still larger than life and this is just the first of many squeezes. Naked short selling still exists and is GME is still on the list. There is more internal buying taking place by Cohen and his benevolent goons. Melvin has 01/15 24P and we will not let this shit touch $24. 

The shorters know there will be paper-handed profit takers on the way up and they will wait for steadiness and dips to keep covering trying to average down their price point. HOLD! Do not let them. The harder the squeeze, the heavier the pressure is on the those filthy non believers. This squeeze will continue and will last weeks, don’t even try to set limit sells unless they’re at $500, no one here has any idea what the peak is if we keep the pressure on Melvin. And for any doubters that are laughing at $500 limit sells, let me explain with a retarded ELI-autistic thesis.

If every single share of GME was put up for sale at once and there was no buy interest, the price floor is $0. Now imagine the opposite where we have buy interest larger than shares outstanding (i.e. all shorts were to cover at once), what is the ceiling? Who the fuck knows, especially any of us retards.

Now we know the two extremes, reality lies somewhere in between depending on how many shorts cover, get margin called etc and how many paper-handed pussies choose to sell early. 

TLDR: fuck Melvin, hold GME shares like your wife holds her boyfriend

$GME-When to sell if we MOASS - Lessons from Volkswagen,0.99,"TLDR; 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Everyone wants to know when to sell. We know the real squeeze hasn't started yet. So this post is to address people wanting to sell at the peak when none of us know the peak.

Using Volkswagen's MOASS for some historical context.

Months leading up to MOASS, stock price doubled and there was a big dip the Friday before the MOASS ( € 65 Euro drop).

Monday - At start of trading day jumps to  € 348, up 66% from Friday close b/c of weekend press release by Porsche. Closes the day up 149%.  
Tuesday - Starts lower than Monday close but then goes up. During day it hits the high point at  € 1K . It closed at  € 945 that Tuesday.  
Wednesday - Porsche jumps in and offers shares to help the shorts. And price starts going down.  
Friday - Closed at  € 495.

Lets be honest, most of us don't hold enough shares to make any kind of dent in the squeeze if it happens. And 99% of us are 📃👐.  If you learn anything from Volkswagen, if a MOASS happens, it won't be one day and you have to 💎👐 through the dips if you want to sell close to the peak. Even if you miss the peak, you will still be able to catch it on the way down, which is higher than you 📃👐 can normally hold and sell for.

**My plan**: Sell 1/3 of my shares (4,200 shares) @ $100 to take profit.

Wait to see a real drop before selling the rest. **Remember the market puts on breakers when a stock drops a certain % from the previous close. It will slow down how quickly the price drops.**

"VALE: Iron Ore, Infrastructure, Inflation and Brazil",0.87,"First of all, it's pronounced Val-é, like valley. Make sure before you go pitching this, know it's not ""vail"". You will get laughed out of the boardroom or bus station depending on when you meet the MD.

TLDR: VALE $25 Jan 2022.

&#x200B;

**Iron Ore**: Like MT, which was the hottest meme stonk of 2 weeks ago before all the retards went back to trying to see who mark the top on GME, VALE is driven by iron ore and resource prices. However instead of the prices of finished steel products which is what MT deals in, Vale deals in the dirty stuff out of the ground.

1. So why not MT like a regular autismo? Well, finished steel products have already had the extended run due to demand far outstripping inventories from 2019/2020. Yes you can make the argument that the supply/demand issue can become more problematic, but you might be buying something very extended. Plus, these kinds of price shocks are called ""transitory,"" meaning that the extra demand is unsustainable (it's just all the orders hitting at once). Plus, we're dealing with steel here, not something precious and supply-constrained like gold or girlfriends.
2. Honestly, why not MT? Well, their input prices (iron ore and energy) might start heading up.
3. If anyone here has taken basic economics, this is the start of a curve shift (instead of moving along the curve) as everyone country in the world starts building with newly printed/borrowed money (more on that later). Demand from mills will drive up prices of the input goods, which in this case is iron ore.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fvb6o60ms4b61.png?width=1194&format=png&auto=webp&s=01fc39ce24539fc23244d154826d976d8dd9b0e8

**Infrastructure**: Everyone who can borrow is borrowing. We're in year 12 now of massive monetary loosening, and it's not really working because all the new liquidity is going straight into stonks and financial assets which yield more than building bridges or improving that road.

1. Why isn't this just lip service again? In the US especially, we have the return of Mama Yellen. Her economics is pretty classical Keynesian, or that you need fiscal (government) spending instead of monetary easing. As Keynes said, you can't loosen a bag by pushing on a rope (you can slow the economy by increasing rates, but you can't always improve it by going the other way). She has had first hand experience in this during her term as Fed Chair: rates are still dragging near 0, but inflation was still nonexistent. Who has control of fiscal spending now? The Tax and Spend Democrats who will definitely at least listen to what Mama Yellen has to say. This is also the main driver of green stocks (we're going to ~~print~~ ~~borrow~~ tax so much money and build so many chargepoints). But before that, we're going to build new highways, roads, buildings etc.
2. What about overseas? Infrastructure bonds are easier to issue than other types. Basically, the borrower would usually be a government (slightly more trustworthy). These countries which formerly borrowed at nosebleed levels in US dollars has suddenly seen their interest rates drop, with the ability to borrow in local currency. Are they going to spend on infrastructure? Well, that's what their bond is backed by. Even though 80% of the money is going to go to an oligarch, at least a bridge will be built.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2sogh48qu4b61.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=f40170cacd8c1f20fda16238720c51c77132791a

**Inflation**: this is my weakest point, but a helpful one. I expect inflation to start heading up these next few years, especially in the US because of where the money is going.

1. Wage increases. Biden's has repeatedly said he will raise the federal minimum wage to $15. Yes, you can argue that will move towards more automation and lower the actual amount of people working, but this section is not going to argue about that. One of the main reasons why goods inflation (not asset inflation) has been so low is because those who benefited from lower yields do not automatically spend more. How many burgers can Bezos eat in 1 day? With higher wages hitting a larger part of the population who will actually spend it, inflation is expected to go up, driving up the prices of everything else.
2. Central Bank tolerance of inflation. The fed has already said they are moving more towards long run inflation averaging. This means higher inflation will be tolerated for longer, because the years before that had low inflation. This view, coupled with the fed's view that any spike in prices after we get out of the pandemic will be transitory, means that we have the prefect mix of powder and oxygen to spark runaway inflation. What benefits during these times? Good ol' usable metal.

**Brazil:** Everyone and their ~~mothers~~ idiot wealth advisors are clamoring for emerging markets again. This time, there are a few different drivers:

1. Cheap liquidity, and even cheaper dollars. Go read about the carry trade here. The dollar will be weak in the next few years because of additional borrowing and spending, but also even more because everyone will be selling dollars to buy overseas assets. Why? Well, there's higher return overseas, like the Bovespa vs SPX chart below.
2. Higher tax rates in the US. You know that's what's going to happen. You know corporate taxes are going to get bumped up to 28% from 21%. Tech companies are smart enough to move their profits overseas, but not so much for domestic manufacturing. Vale is incorporated in Brazil, which last time I checked wasn't the US.
3. Brazil is super cheap right now. That also has to do with the fact most Brazilian companies are involved in natural resources and agriculture, which doesn't have the shine of tech. This is also why Vale is so cheap and doesn't move as much (more below).
4. Regulation? Brazil doesn't have them. You want to blow up half the Amazon? Well, does it make money?

&#x200B;

Note: Vale does not move as quickly as tech companies. It's a damn mining company. Fortunately, the IVs are also relatively low (40% for $25 Jan 2022, at about $1 a contract). I do not recommend playing anything before June.",2021-01-13 17:45:49

$GME DD for the average Autist. Why 35$ is cheap for GME.,0.97,"Ok retards. Listen up. Papa cohen and his 2 migos (the same 3 guys that got Chewey to a $46 Billion market cap) are about to take you and every autist to the moon.

Without getting too technical, a group of fucking assholes called Melvin Capital or some shit are knee deep in Puts. They were suppressing the price at 22$ for the past month. Today the price shot up 60% and Melvin is probably having a stroke right now. They will have to eventually buy these shares back from us Autists, institutions, and every other lucky fuck who has a GME share to sell. 

Problem for these boomers, is that the board of $GME holds 20% of the overall stock. On top of that, institutions like Blackrock, Vanguard hold another 20% or so, they will NOT sell. Wall Street Bets has 1.8 million users. Dont underestimate our power. On top of that, Cramer is going to shill this to every boomer today/tommorow. Look at his twitter.

So basically Autists, if we keep buying up GME, Melvin and his boomer friends will be fukt. GME at a $25 Billion market cap means that GME is valued at ~300$/share. 35$ is a STEAL. 

3 Step TLDR for the ultimate Autist: 
1. BUY GME STOCK NOT OPTIONS. 2. HOLD FOR 3-6 MONTHS. 3. BUY LAMBO FOR YOUR WIFES BOYFRIEND.",2021-01-13 17:40:43

INTC vs retards,0.32,"i will spare you with any sophisticated DD cause it would only be throwing pearls before swines. so i try to feed you the mud that all of you degenerates so desperately desire.

i know that 95% of ppl here enjoy self humiliation more than anything else, but listen:
instead of losing vast amounts of money to trades on companies that are either completely overvalued or something that even cocksucking trevor milton wouldnt consider a company, why not try something else.

during your raging browses through the internet, rapidly shifting between ""research"" on some of the usual random shit companies and granny midget porn, you might once have stumbled upon a company that weirdly does not have a ""-"" sign in front of all its financials. 
financial expert that you are you think ""OmG i OnLy inVeST iN gRoWth CoMpAniEs, FuNdaMenTals arE fuR CuCkz"", let me tell you something:
there is a company out there that is making huge amounts of money while at the same time being the very backbone of all your ""growth"" memestocks. basically the skeleton where all the degenerate limbs of companies that you like so much are hanging on to.

so here is the deal:
instead of buying GME at 30$ because you think this can not in any way go tits up, you will buy INTC instead. calls, shares, whatever, you dont understand what this means anyways. with the money you save you can finally pay someone to fuck your ugly wife so she finally shuts up. if you buy shares, every quarter you will receive some additional money that you can re-invest in getting the latest STDs from your local crackwhores.

you see, this is the opposite of what you are used to: a so called win-win situation. i will finally get the money i deserve for putting money in a vastly undervalued company. you will get the first proper fuck since that one time where daddy told you not to speak about this anymore.

positions: 25k INTC shares @ ~49$

Day 3 discussion on the dollar and a market correction,0.86,"Today Goldman Sachs chief economist warned of a coming correction in the market. We’ve been discussing the dollar bouncing and this possible correction for the last couple days. This is my 3rd post on the subject. 

I’ve come to understand from some of your comments that many traders here do not view the market in periods longer than a day. Certainly not in weeks or months. When I say that the dollar is bouncing, it isn’t going to happen in a day. So when you see the dollar rising and falling over the next couple weeks, save the “This didn’t age well” comments and wait, because moves in the dollar happen over weeks and months - not hours and days. My outlook for the correction is late Jan/Feb So don’t read this and think that the market is gonna sell off tomorrow. Personally I still think we have one leg higher to go in the SP500 before the correction. 

Goldman coming out and also warning of a correction today, increases my conviction about what I am saying. I don’t like big trading firms, I think they are market manipulators with criminal rapsheets. That doesn’t mean I ignore them when they say these things, especially when it reinforces my own thesis on the market which I developed independent of their analysis. 

Anyways, hope some of you find value in this. And on a side note, watching GME blast off today put a huge smile on my face. Nicely played WSB... ya did good kid. 👍🏻",2021-01-13 16:45:33

For those who doubted $GME.,0.96,"You’ll be seeing a lot of gain porn throughout the entirety of today. For those of you who paper handed, I’m sorry. Although maybe it opened your eyes to realize that WSB runs the market. We’re bigger than investment firms, hence why there’s still a play to be made.

PLTR. Yet to explode, yet held on by all the same diamond hands of $GME. There’s a presentation at the end of this month for Palantir and it’s for showcasing their technology so shareholders and people who haven’t gotten in yet can better understand the product they’re providing. Although you don’t want to get in after the presentation, you need to get in before. If you think that $GME is exploding, just wait because $PLTR is known by everyone. I’ve even heard random idiots at bars talking about it. The amount of diamond 💎 hands 🖐 in PLTR is catastrophic, there’s no doubt that this company will succeed in the future. 

Lockup.

Lockup period is coming to an end, and shareholders will be selling their stakes. It’s inevitable, but that’s why you make a play on PLTR now because the drive up before lockup will be something extraordinary since shareholders will try to maximize their gains upon lockup ending. Take those GME tendies and put them straight back into the market with good ol’ Palantir.

Make some money now, sell before lockup and screw over the shareholders by forcing them to hold their shares once again. The amount of volume upon lockup ending will be tremendous and quite possibly the biggest shit show of 2021. I’m in for the ride and hope you guys are too.

TL;DR: Presentation end of month = Drive up in stock price. Lockup in early February = Drive up for shareholders to capitalize their gains.

This makes you realise how deep the shorts and puts are right now and despite our huge run how massively more they have to cover. Remember our calculations that it takes a few days for shorts to cover because of massive short to float ratio.

I am not a financial advisor and explaining why the run has not been stopping since the morning.

"Thoughts on Buying GME in CASH accounts , on stockloans and segregation",0.94,"Listen fuckers,

My actual work function is outside equities. But I can walk you through some technicalities of how borrowing of shares work and the technicalities behind short squeezes.

&#x200B;

Try to not buy GME on margin, the more GME is bought in cash accounts, the more buyins are forced on shorts.

&#x200B;

Buyins are done on the open market to source shares and or to close out short positions for which there are no shares to pair against (DTC participants do not like allowing naked shorts and violating REG SHO). DTC participants will also not go into negative share segregation either.

&#x200B;

Basically: If Morgan Stanley requires 30,000 GME from GS, GS could have 100,000 but if it is segregated, it will not be able to make delivery to MS. Over time, MS will force GS to take action to source shares. If it cannot a buyin can be executed and the burden (mkt cost and position closeout) will be passed to GS. This illustrated example can happen regardless of a long or short market bias on a security. A stock could be un-sourcable, even if a huge majority of participants are long. It just means a lot of the float is tightly held,and held in cash accounts-- you usually only see this in grandpa stocks, or thinly traded stocks for the buy and hold camp of people.

&#x200B;

So, if there is a huge rush of cash account buying, there will be more shares held in segregation which will force closeouts of short positions (smaller ones not huge insitutional bets). These buyins are always literally market buys and the  burden is passed from the investment bank to the short.

&#x200B;

Now in theory, this is only sustainable for a short amount of time because you autists will have to sell and realize gains for those sweet tendies, but in a world of sunshine and rainbows, this buying could continue day after day and the whole thing becomes a positive feedback loop.",2021-01-13 16:01:05

What happens when a company's shares short is more than the outstanding number of shares and the company then announces dividend? Will shorts have to pay more in dividend than the actual amount of money that will be spent by the company for dividend? GME gang,0.91,"Let's assume there's only 5 GME shares in total.

Let me make my question even more clearer.
Suppose A has 5 share. B sells short the 5 shares. Now C buys those 5 shares. Again D short sells those shares. E buys it.

Now, A, B and E must receive their dividend of $10 for their 5 shares. So in total they receive $30. Short sellers must pay them $30?

But there were only 5 total outstanding shares in the first place. So the company only spends $10 in dividends whereas the short sellers have to spend $30?
Is this true?

I have been asking this question in Quora, reddit etc. Everyone seems to be giving an answer that's opposite of the other persons answer. I have posted in daily threads, r/investing etc.

Hope wallstreetbets can actually give me a clear and concise answer.

GME - EndGame: DTC Infinity.,0.98,"Hello again folks. I’ve taken some time to do my own DD on GME and sharing it with you, in addition to all the other great DD out there. I’m going to cover shorts, debt, and what I think might accelerate GME’s mission to Mars.

**TL:DR;** GME is a ticking time bomb. Shorts R Fuk. Buy shares, Sell puts to acquire shares cheaper. Buy leaps on red days. No idea what's gonna happen in the very short term but 2021 will be massive.

# About the Shorts

So, updated short interest came out today. If you haven’t seen it, shorts **increased** their positions through the end of the year:

&#x200B;

[12\/31 short position update](https://preview.redd.it/k66xyn1oq1b61.png?width=781&format=png&auto=webp&s=a61c48086c09a509fe4a7152db90ba4a3c082323)

What. The. Fuck.

I really can’t figure out the macro logic here because from the outside it looks like they’re digging their own graves.

On the day-to-day scale, I think I understand how this is happening. If you look at the days with a high short volume ratio, the narrative is clear: Shorts are actively trying to defend GME crossing 20 significantly, and coming in hard when threatened. Shorts also took advantage of general market selloff on Jan 4 to push GME down.

&#x200B;

[Days with heavy shorting activity](https://preview.redd.it/dir3ss9sq1b61.png?width=1175&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d0859c5aff4dce709a27b945786507ba9c4de18)

This is also why GME ended up ***only*** \~12% after the recent RC announcement. Short volume was a whopping **4MM** shares on that day.

The problem is shorts are doing all this active shorting to defend their existing short positions, but they’re either not able or not choosing to close all of the intraday shorting, so it’s accumulating. As of 12/31 the **total short positions (71.2M) exceed total issued shares (69.75M).**

# The precarious position of the shorter

Shorts find themselves in a very precarious position. Let’s talk about the float and DTC (days-to-close). **The DTC number you see above is a lie.** There’s an argument to be made that **DTC is infinity.**

There are a total of 69.75M shares issued by GME. According to [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kw0djb/gme_floatshort_data/) who has a CapIQ subscription, insiders hold 22.8M shares. I was able to verify using this [nasdaq source](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/insider-activity) that the top insiders hold about 20% of shares:

&#x200B;

[Top Insider Holdings](https://preview.redd.it/id7ppwjvq1b61.png?width=781&format=png&auto=webp&s=abc9f4103776787f435ebbe719f5420c776d7ad1)

The thing with insiders is that they can’t easily sell due to lots of restrictions so they’re not considered part of the “actively” traded part of the stock. I.e. They can’t just sell on price action.

In addition to insiders, [**institutions now own 110% of GME shares**](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings)**.** (Thanks shorters!). Some of these institutions may actively trade, but the top holdings (FMR, BlackRock, Vanguard, etc.) *will not trade based on price action* as they are generally holding for their ETFs / index funds that hold GME.

&#x200B;

[Institutional Holdings](https://preview.redd.it/de46p98yq1b61.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b3b9332efb259e72eae6209a3ce1743ed0b462f)

Now, thought experiment. What happens ***if*** shorts decide to cover? They have to buy back 71M shares. Who are they going to buy it back from?

1. They can’t buy them back from insiders.
2. Let’s be conservative here, and say that Fidelity, BlackRock, Vanguard will hold on to their shares, but all of the other institutions will paper hand when shorts start to cover. This is very conservative because there are other institutions that hold GME for their own ETFs.

So, 69.75M shares - 22.8M for insiders - 23.43M held by BlackRock/Vanguard/Fidelity = **23.52M shares left.** So fuck all other short-to-float ratios out there, the **short % of tradable float is at least 300%.**

[Investopedia ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daystocover.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways-,Days%20to%20cover%2C%20also%20called%20short%20ratio%2C%20measures%20the%20expected,for%20the%20company%20in%20question.)tells us that days to cover is *“calculated by taking the* ***number of currently shorted shares*** *and* ***dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume*** *for the company in question.”*

GME’s [20-day average daily volume](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/technical-analysis) is about 10.4M shares, so that’s about 6.83 days to cover. This, however, is **a lie.** *The DTC definition listed by Investopedia stops making sense when short interest exceeds purchasable float.*

Math whiz’s out there… if you have to buy 71M shares from a pool of 23.5M shares, and GME’s daily volume is 11M shares a day, how many days will it take to cover?

Answer: **Infinity. You can’t. You can never cover.** There literally are not enough shares to buy to close your shorts. You can only buy-to-close 23.5M shares, and that’s even if you can convince all of them to sell (i.e. $$$$$). **True DTC is Infinity.** This is part of the reason shorts haven’t covered. *There’s no way out of the burning building they’re in.*

# How it gets worse part 1) Institutional Buying

Here’s how it gets worse. Besides all the retards like you and me buying GME b/c of Lord Cohen and u/DeepFuckingValue, GME is about to cross some serious thresholds that make it attractive to more institutional buying.

First, in the recent [Q4 numbers](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results) release:

* “The Company is continuing to suspend guidance, however, unless further unforeseen COVID-19 related impacts occur, it expects to realize positive comparable store sales results and **profitability** in the fiscal fourth quarter.

So, GME is about to cross into the positive EPS category, which in addition to the debt story below is going to potentially **unlock** **more institutional buying** that is currently blocked by rules like not investing in companies with negative P/E.

Second, let’s talk about debt.

## Debt

Businesses leverage debt to scale; particularly true with retail businesses that have to pay for inventory in advance of selling it. High cost of debt -> lower profits -> lower ability to pay debt -> higher debt costs, and the cycle continues. On the flipside, if GME was able to increase its credit rating, you get lower debt costs, higher profitability, which leads to higher credit rating, etc.

I believe we’re seeing a campaign from GME to pay down debt to reduce a) restrictive covenants in the 2021 notes (preventing things like more share buybacks) and b) upgrade their bonds to investment grade.

Not only will a credit upgrade lead to cheaper debt, it will **unlock more institutional investment that are currently restricted against buying equities with below-investment-grade debt ratings.**

## Debt

* Debt was $472MM up until July 2020

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l87lqgtwr1b61.png?width=1069&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c897cd39f4b8874839fcdf602802cf015d78b22

* GME announced a voluntary pre-payment of $125MM of debt ([link](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2124246/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Voluntary-Early-Redemption-of-Senior-Notes.html)) that will happen 3 days after the earnings call (earnings Dec 8, debt repayment Dec 11)... “**using cash generated from operations to reduce our outstanding debt”**

## Debt rating:

* First, take a look at GME’s bond pricing. GME’s bonds were significantly impacted by the March crash. However, GME’s bond pricing has recovered and is now **trading at par**, meaning the market believes that GME will pay back its debt (i.e. not a bankruptcy risk).

&#x200B;

[GME Bonds trading at par](https://preview.redd.it/cu6rpvpur1b61.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cd2fd2376d717c198e65aa7d9f22ed4ec77b853)

* Now, look at its Moody’s rating history. First, for context, anything under a Baa3 rating is considered junk (ratings chart here) and greatly affects who can buy your bonds and what types of rates you get.

&#x200B;

[Moody's debt ratings. GME currently sits at B3](https://preview.redd.it/56e3ba82s1b61.png?width=867&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1f56f076c11f01204a1086b43670a5a48ab7f30)

Here are Moody’s actions on GME ([source](https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/GameStop-Corp-credit-rating-808528072)). In particular:

* Downgrade on 5/2019 to Ba2
* Downgrade on 1/2020 to B2
* Downgrade on 4/2020 to Caa1
* Upgrade on 7/2020 to B3

&#x200B;

[GME upgraded to B3 in Jul 2020](https://preview.redd.it/menraih6s1b61.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=da868433f2546ffe1c5ce3294e48559d9f03e256)

## Speculation on debt:

* GME is working with Moody’s & others to get credit rating back to Investment grade. Showing **positive earnings/profitability** and **paying back debt early** is key to this. I believe we should see an upgrade soon to at least Baa3 (the lowest level of investment-grade debt).
* The market is not generally considering GME’s debt as risky as Moody’s credit rating would suggest. The market can move faster than Moody’s.

Positive EPS + Debt ratings upgrade = massive institutional buying = shorts further in the hole.

# How it gets worse part 2) Passive Buying Feedback Loop

GME is part of [62 ETFs holding about 10.7M shares](https://www.etf.com/stock/GME) in addition to a whole bunch in index funds (not ETFs). I couldn’t get a number for index funds but am going to estimate around 10M for them as well given the Vanguard/Fidelity numbers above.

More than 50% of these holdings are passive, **market-cap weighted funds**. Now here’s the feedback loop that really fucks the short story up.

1. Institutions buy GME ->
2. Price goes up ->
3. Market Cap Goes up ->
4. Weight in Funds Goes up ->
5. ETFs buy more GME for every $ of inflow ->
6. Price goes up -> return to step 3

At $20, GME is already up >5x from its low of \~$4 in 2020. This means that for every $1 thrown into IWM, for example, Blackrock is putting 5x as much of that $1 into GME as it was back at GME’s lows. As GME’s price goes up, **any market-cap weighted fund puts more money into GME for every $1 of inflow.**

The passive feedback loop has already started. It will really kick into high gear with institutional buying.

# Other speculations:

1. I believe RC is already slated to be CEO, and this will be announced in the June 2021 annual shareholder meeting.
   1. This is why the ICR presentation was pulled. RC didn’t want the content in the ICR presentation to be the market-adopted story on the GME strategy.
   2. 3 board members are retiring. I believe this is part of a pre-negotiated deal where RC is taking over. The 3 that are stepping down didn’t agree with the mgmt change.
2. GME is due for a re-rate of price/sales. GME is currently trading at a P/S of 1 - if you ONLY include the ecommerce revenue. From a total revenue perspective it’s closer to .2. **GME is currently worth less than its quarterly revenue.** From the [Q4 sales pre-release](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results):
   1. “Net quarterly sales were $1.770 billion”
   2. “E-Commerce sales, which are included in comparable store sales, rose 309% and represented approximately 34% of total company sales, with total worldwide E-Commerce sales year to date reaching over $1.35 billion, far exceeding the Company’s $1.0 billion growth objective;”

At this point, it’s really the endgame for shorts. They have to find a way to exit before Cohen is CEO.

2023 a TSLA GME story,0.86,"Elon is a believer in gaming. He thinks that in autonomous vehicles, entertainment is crucial and that gaming is the most preferred form of entertainment.

[The first hint](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1343608530998153222)

At this point in time, TSLA will be . . . well the same, huge and in a class of its own (sorry NIO).

GME will be fully recovered and have shifted into mobile gaming (phones, cars, busses, trains, planes, waiting rooms, not quite in the age of functional contact lens entertainment . . .).

We can only hope to imagine what the sit down between Elon and RC would entail.  My best guess is that they meet for a private game of battleship (Elon not a big fan of chess) wearing short shorts.  Out of respect, RC only lets one nut dangle out of his shorts so that Elon can have the two nut seniority.

They realize VR is out of the question - too many lawsuits, but then realize they can just add bullshit to the terms and conditions and go full VR.  I'm talking VR racing (ironic isn't it), VRcations to Ibiza, and unfortunately the dreaded VR work meeting.

Some less innovative but nearly as rich asshole companies, will immediately hop on board to milk the bonus productivity from its employees.  Think about it, company cars that take employees to and from home, meetings, conferences, etc. that track in vehicle activity.  This pressures employees to work from the car as often as possible, and the best part for the company is the car drives itself back after dropping off said employee at home.  Every large company will be forced to order their own tesla work vehicle fleet to compete with the productivity.

GME Short Squeeze Additional Plays,0.79,"I'm a moron, and was trying to think of some additional plays should the GME short squeeze start to occur. The first thing that comes to mind is that shorts may have their long positions closed as they get margin called as GME rises - which could cause sell offs in other seemingly unrelated equities. Is this an absolutely stupid strategy?

I went to see what Melvin Capital was holding and what I would liquidate if I was in such a crunch. They seem to have quite a few EXPE calls that are could be deep in the money, they also appear to own approximately 5% of EXPE's shares and 5x of it's average daily volume. As a best guess, they are up 40-50% on this position, so it might be one they would close to cover - and could possibly cause a selloff as a result. They also own a fair amount of FISV and FISV calls, but figure they'd liquidate the calls before they sell any shares. There are a couple other positions I was looking into but wasn't sure it was worth my time.

However, other than puts, I did not see a short position listed on on the information I was getting (I just googled Melvin Holdings and checked the first site that didn't charge me to see some of the info from a 9/30/20 13F). Is there some place to confirm MC has short positions and not just puts? Is this a complete waste of time, or is a sell off probable for those that get caught with burnt shorts? Lastly, are there any strategies that would likely be used by a company like MC that would indicate which positions they might close (i.e. FIFO, biggest gain, worst performing, whatever would likely affect prices the least, etc) that might not be something a WSB moron like myself might be aware of?

TLDR: Should I spend time trying to find stocks that might sell off as a result of GME shorts losing leverage as the squeeze takes place, and if so - any recommended (preferably free) websites for accurate information that an ignoramus could use?

Because my rabid attention span jumps around like a coked-up kangaroo, **use** **bold words** so that I can skim and don't have to stretch my brain around comprehending complete sentences. 

Because I am financially illiterate, when you say ""technical analysis"" I hear Tech, $NKLA, and anal cysts. I'm confused. I hurt myself in my confusion. I choose $NKLA. Bad call. For proper direction, I need a big ass arrow and in a three to fours words description, **tell me where to allocate my two brain cells.**

Here's a list of trades [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cZ2rNqW123eTj7rapyWNWC-zHEaLs79njlHEIJRY1\_U/edit#gid=199204529](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cZ2rNqW123eTj7rapyWNWC-zHEaLs79njlHEIJRY1_U/edit#gid=199204529)

My ROI from swing-trading over the last 45 days is almost 50%. Small peepee, I know, but gains is gains.

If I just kept adding more GME shares to my portfolio over the last 45 days (buy and hold), my ROI would be less than 15%.

***I don't know about you, but I want 50% more money, not 15% more money.***

So, if we ignore the short-term taxes (pain in the ass), there's a case to be made for ***some*** swing trading AKA paperhanding. Especially with such an obviously manipulated stock like GME (no doubt it's getting suppressed. Fuck Melvin. Fuck BofA.)

But, it gotta be done smartly. Let's quickly go over some examples

**SCENARIO 1**

Monday, January 11 2021 - the awesome news of Daddy Cohen joining the Board of Directors, paired with the really meh holiday sales report was an obvious signal the stock is gonna experience some drastic moves. We all know what happened - solid volume, but we slammed into that $20.6 wall, then we took a few steps back only to get stuck at $20.5 again and then it was over. Solid 12.7% green day in the end.

But, nobody really knew what was gonna happen, before it happened. This is the time where you 💎👐, because there's way too many variables to predict where the price will go and where it will end. if it goes $2+ up, you don't sell, if it goes $2 down, you don't sell. Just hold and let the dust settle. Stonk will eventually go up anyway, so no need to rush anything.

I personally held 312 GME bags since December 31 - that's a lot of painful red days before yesterday for me.

**SCENARIO 2**

Today, Tuesday, January 12 2021 - Not the best day for 🧻👐 swing trading, but pattern got established early on... After getting rejected at $20.6 and $20.5 the day before, [it didn't even manage to break $20.4 today](https://prnt.sc/wm5r8u), then it was [followed by the $20.25 ceiling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kvwpxg/gme_autists_preparing_to_break_the_2025_ceiling/). I sold at $20.17 (bought at $19.01 on December 31, remember?). The price was pretty bouncy after I sold, but volume was low, so the price wasn't moving up or down too much despite big swings in RSI. Therefore, I concluded it was not gonna fall much below $19.78 for the rest of the day. It fell to $19.73 IIRC, but I bought at $19.78.

***Without spending a single extra cent out of my own pocket, I now own more GME shares than at the start of the trading day.***

Tomorrow, I will observe if the price upswing gets rejected again and look to sell at $20.3, maybe $20.4, immediately in the first trading hour after market opens. Then, I'll watch and see if we get a massive sell off like today and buy the dip.

If the price upswing doesn't get rejected, instead it continues climbing above $20.4 and breaks the $20.6 wall tomorrow, I will not sell, instead I will 💎👐. However, unless we get some good news, tomorrow will probably be meh like today.

**SCENARIO 3**

Monday, January 4 2021 - You're an idiot like me and you buy at $19.01 on December 31 2020. Come Monday, the price plummets all the way down to $17.1 or whatever it was. Red day, bloody as fuck. Do you 🧻👐, or do you 💎👐?

The answer is obvious, ***you wipe your ass with diamonds until your ass and the shit coming out of it bleed as well.***

That's what I did. It hurt. But I didn't sell, I held. Reward finally came today when I sold for a decent profit, and then used that profit to buy the dip.

More shares, more gains.

POSITION: europoor 318 shares at $19.78 as of today

The stock is poised to rally back to october highs with guidance, buybacks, and a SHORT SQUEEZE**   


* **Short interest is still extremely high at 76% and earnings were honestly strong**
* **Jim cramer - ""shorts are trying to control the price right now"" but he talked with the CEO and the company looks great**
* **He thinks it has much more room to grow and is AMAZING value**
* **150 million in buybacks coming before february 29th**
* **strong guidance from earnings**
* **Bigger stimulus from biden**
* **YoY growth was HUGE with a gain of .08 EPS vs -.38 EPS last year**

**Buybacks:**

**With an accelerated repurchase program, BBBY is buying back 150 MILLION dollars in shares (7 million shares) before February 27th.**  

**Strong earnings and buybacks will kill shorts over the next month, and BBBY will continue climbing.**

**""Failed"" Earnings:**

**Here's an excerpt from the ""failed"" earnings calls that shorts want you to believe was horrible**

**Mark Tritton:** 

Simply put, we're delivering on what we said we would do. We said we would put a team in place that would have the right talent and expertise to execute our new vision and inject new ideas and that we will create the right organizational structure to facilitate more streamlined decision-making, and we've done that. We said we would lean into the digital space and make it easier and more convenient for our customers to shop with us, and we are doing that. We said we will reset our cost structure, modernize for growth, and refine our organization, and we've done that and continue to focus on gross margin improvement.

We said we had a clear mandate to reestablish our authority as the preferred omnichannel home destination and that we would use customer-inspired and market insights to develop our new customer value proposition, and we are doing that. We said we would evaluate our asset base and how best to optimize its value to the business on a go-forward basis, and we have done that. And finally, we said our mission is to ensure that Bed Bath & Beyond is well-positioned for long-term success, and we're doing just that. 

**- EBITDA up 300% YoY**

**- Digital sales up 69%**

**- Debt lowered**

  
**BBBY gives me GME vibes after earnings. Belittled by shorts before it moons.**

The stock still has tons of room to go. Christmas earnings and stimulus checks are coming and shorts are panicking. Ride this stock to 25$ or even higher

GME P/S Ratio 🚀🚀🚀 to $90?,0.95,"This is going to be a quick example on only one ratio why GME is still undervalued and could theoretically be valued at $90 a share.


Let's me start with this quote.

 ""Price to Sale (P/S) ratios between one and two are generally considered good, while a P/S ratio of less than one is considered excellent.""  - [source](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032515/what-considered-favorable-price-sales-ratio.asp#:~:text=Price-to-sales%20(P%2FS)%20ratios%20between,can%20vary%20significantly%20between%20industries.)

So if we look at GME, it has a market cap of 1.4 billion.

To get a P/S ratio we divide market cap by 2020 Revenues (6.466 billion) 

1.4 / 6.466 = .21

Like the quote says anything under 1 is excellent and anything between 1-2 is considered good so to get a P/S of 1 you get a market cap of 6.466 billion well if the market cap was 6.466 billion each share would be valued at $92 instead of the current price of $20.

To get a P/S ratio of 2 you would double that and the price would be $184.

Cathie Ark-Backed Tech Innovator Kratos Defense [KTOS] Will Moon After Tomorrow’s Conference. [Free Crayon Bonus Included] [THICC Fundumendals] 🚀🚀🚀,0.96,"**TL;DR** on the bottom unless you're into masochism cuz I took Adderall for this and it's long as fuck.

I called GRWG, I called RAVN, now its time for me to take Mommy Cathie’s hand and lead my fellow WSBautists to the moon once more. KTOS makes rockets, and there's one with our name on it. 🚀

**Quick Wikipedia Introduction:**

&amp;gt;**Kratos Defense &amp;amp; Security Solutions, Inc**, (NASDAQ: [KTOS](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/ktos)), headquartered in San Diego, California,specializes in directed-energy weapons, unmanned systems, satellite communications, cyber security/warfare, microwave electronics, missile defense, training and combat systems.   
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;Customers include the U.S. federal government, foreign governments, commercial enterprises and state and local government agencies. Kratos is organized into six major divisions:   
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;Defense and Rocket Support Services   
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;Microwaves Electronics  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;Modular Systems  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;Public Safety and Security  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;Technology and Training  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;Unmanned Systems.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;Some of Kratos' newest products are part of a Pentagon effort to partner with innovators and incubate technology-focused businesses in Silicon Valley  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;Kratos has primarily an engineering and technically oriented work force of approximatively 2,700 with a substantial number of the Company's employees holding national security clearances. Virtually all of Kratos' work is performed on a military base, in a secure facility or at a critical infrastructure location.

**Why You’re Really Here**

**October 8th, 2020**, ARK Investment Management LLC filed a 13F-HR form disclosing ownership of **558,726 shares** worth $8,733,000.

**November 30th, 2020**, ARK Investment Management LLC filed a 13F-HR form disclosing ownership of **1,106,685 shares** worth about $21,337,000 USD—representing a 98% increase in shares and a 144% increase in value in under two months. GUH 🚀🚀🚀

ARK recently doubled their stake in KTOS, and they're are not alone in their confidence. 

Smart money loves KTOS, as illustrated by their 89.86% institutional ownership: 

* Blackrock has a 6.83% stake in the company at 8.3 million shares
* Vanguard has a 6.55% stake at 8 million shares
* Fidelity has a 5.36% stake at 6.6 millions shares. [Source](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=KTOS&amp;amp;subView=institutional)

I'm no genius, and neither are you. But I have made myself good money riding the coattails of those with billions at stake and teams of researchers behind them.

That said, institutional ownership comes as no surprise as far as defense companies go. Instituions love to own them. They’re safe investments. The military's got deep pockets and smart money knows never to bet against America. 

However, Kratos is not just any old Defense and Aerospace company. There is a reason that ARKQ [added 153,098 shares to their fund just last week.](https://cathiesark.com/ark-combined-holdings-of-ktos)

**Like GRWG, Kratos Defense and Security Solutions has spent the last ten years gobbling up their competition.** Six acquisitions and one merger later, the frequency of their contracts reflect their place as a leader in military tech development:

* December 8th, 2020: [Kratos Receives $37.7 Million Skyborg Program Contract Award from USAF Advanced Aircraft Office](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kratos-receives-377-million-skyborg-program-contract-award-usaf)
* December 10th, 2020: [Naval Air Systems Command Exercises Option for an Additional $38.7 Million for Full Rate Production (Lot 2) of the BQM-177A Subsonic Aerial Target System](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/naval-air-systems-command-exercises-option-additional-387)

* December 29, 2020: [Kratos Awarded Contract Modification Valued at $22 Million to Provide Satellite Command and Control System Sustainment](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kratos-awarded-contract-modification-valued-22-million-provide)
* December 30, 2020: [Kratos C5IS Business Receives $10.5 Million in National Security Related Program Orders](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kratos-c5isr-business-receives-105-million-national-security)
* Januray 4, 2020: [Kratos Receives $11 Million Development Contract for Next Generation Satellite Program](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kratos-receives-11-million-development-contract-next-generation)

Kratos’ acquisitions have allowed it to develop proprietary technologies that are sold as products. Not only that, but as many of the above contracts show, they are also being paid 🚀 buku bucks 🚀 to maintain and service the products and tech that they sell.

But ok yeah, sure, they produce: disposable missiles made for aerial target practice, small sUAS swarming drones, satellites, radios, and augmented reality simulation training systems and microwave electronics—but that is not what grabbed my attention and surely not what grabbed the attention of Cathie Ark. 

Ready for the kicker? Say it with me now:

**Ground Vehicle Automation**

&amp;gt;The Kratos Multi-Platform Appliqué Kit (M-PAK) is the next generation of Ground Vehicle automation. The system can be used to quickly and easily convert your existing fleet of standard human-driven vehicles into optionally-manned systems that can be driven in manned or unmanned modes. M-PAK is a scalable system that can be used as a stand-alone vehicle mobility kit or sensors can be added to offer various levels of autonomy… M-PAK allows for a semi-permanent installation in a vehicle, which releases the user from committing to one vehicle platform or a particular vehicle.

These two developments are why Cathie bought up KTOS for ARKQ. These vehicle conversion kits also represent Kratos’ foray into the commercial space. Their ground vehicle automation kits, originally used to safely lead military convoys, are now used to man impact-absorbing trailers behind slow-moving highway construction vehicles. Up until recently, the job of driving the impact truck was filled by some poor employee. Now, with Kratos’ product, this job can be completely automated, with the GPS-guided computer safely trailing whatever work vehicle it is instructed to. [Source](https://www.kratosdefense.com/systems-and-platforms/unmanned-systems/ground/autonomous-truck-mounted-attenuator)

Basically, you can turn any truck into a completely independently acting, simple, autonomous vehicle with the installation of this semipermanent kit.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Sea Surface Vehicle Automation** 

&amp;gt;Kratos \[has also\]developed a number of vehicle control systems that are easily installed and quickly convert most human-driven seaborne vessels to unmanned systems.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;The Kratos C2 is currently in use and supporting mission operations for the U.S. Navy and Army utilizing the High-Speed Maneuvering Surface Target (HSMST), which was developed in response to a requirement for a 40+ knot target to represent littoral threats encountered by the fleet and which would retain 35 kt capability in advanced sea states. [Source](https://www.kratosdefense.com/products/uav/land-and-sea/sea-surface-vehicle-automation)

So they’re making boat drones too. 

Militarily, these unmanned sea surface vehicles can be used against seaborne targets and mine hunting. Commercially, the tech being developed by Kratos may have applications in cargo shipping, seaweed farming, and data collection.

**Most Importantly**

In terms of the fundamentals, **tomorrow, January 13, there will be a virtual conference during which time they will be exhibiting some more of their new tech.** I believe that they will play into the recent EV/AI hype and focus on these automation kits and their potential foray into the commercial space. With some good media coverage, I think this could be a very positive catalyst for the stock. I tried calling investor relations to ask some questions, but they dubbed my calls. **Big dick energy. Bullish.** 🚀🚀🚀

&amp;gt;President &amp;amp; CEO, Eric DeMarco, and its Executive VP &amp;amp; CFO, Deanna Lund, will present at the 23rd Annual Needham Virtual Conference on January 13th at 11:30am Eastern. [Link to webcast.](https://wsw.com/webcast/needham103/register.aspx?conf=needham103&amp;amp;page=ktos&amp;amp;url=https://wsw.com/webcast/needham103/ktos/2276742)

**NOW ON TO MY FAVORITE PART: THE TECHNICALS!!!!!**

Very simple, very bullish. Consolidation on an upwards trend. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

[MACD\/RSI Bullish. Beautiful technical setup](https://preview.redd.it/uvhok3mnmwa61.png?width=2004&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=339ee0941d924979ad9345a82d07760a7693843f)

Breakout above the channel and a retest of resistance becoming support. Super solid buy wall at around $25.69. Anything around these levels I would count as buying the bottom. Set a stop loss slightly below the support to minimize downside risk. 

This morning January 12th, premarket action suggests a moon mission. They were [just awarded another 12 million dollar contract a few hours ago](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kratos-awarded-127-million-task-order-complete-cost-optimized). 

**TL;DR: : With its powerful acquisitions, sticky government contacts, consistent revenue growth, institutional backing, THICC technicals and TOMORROW'S imminent positive catalyst, KTOS cannot go tits up. Not to mention Blackrock, Vanguard, and most importantly—Mommy ARK are on our side.**

You've lost half your account on TSLA puts and PLTR calls. You don't have any steel stocks because the other half is in GME shares, bought at 20.50 since Ryan Cohen and his best buds joined the board of directors.

But apart from news of GME pulling out of ICR, there hasn't been any news from GME since January and its now trading at 12 bucks a share. You hear a noise behind and and turn around to see your wife and her boyfriend pointing and laughing at you before they go into her bedroom and close the door.

Dejected, you sell your GME shares and head over to [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) to find some boomer stock that pays you 5 bucks a year in dividends.

While browsing, you get a notification about a new tweet from Ryan, the man himself. Its a singular rocket emoji with a link to GameStop's website. Curious, you click the link.

Fake SIGNAL higher market cap than GME,0.88,,2021-01-11 22:32:59
Weekly Update: Selling the most popular options contracts on Reddit 1/15 EXP,0.85,"I am back this week with some really interesting data to share.  As expected the amount of stocks / contracts picked up massively from last week. For the expiration of 1/15/21 there were 838 contracts  and 1826 mentions of these contracts.  Compared to last week this is a huge jump and really something to talk about.

For those that are new here is a quick introduction: I have been analyzing comments and posts on reddit to determine what stocks/contracts are mentioned the most. This week I am looking at the options contracts that have been mentioned on the subreddits we track. Specifically, I am looking at contracts expiring this Friday 1/15/2021. The data collected for this analysis was collected from 1/1 – 1/8.

The goal here is to track what reddit is following and to see how reddit preforms. There is this notion that retail investors often fail to beat the market. This is why financial advisors recommend that you buy into the major ETF’s such as SPY. As historically there have been few people that manage to beat the major Index’s year over year. My hypothesis going into this week is that I should bet against the trends on reddit as typically the retail investor is wrong.

Current Results: 

1. Week 1: +$1710
2. Week 2: -$2610
3. Week 3: +$45

Total: -$855 

Though we are in the negative out of the 8 contracts our data suggested we sell 7 of them were profitable.  I think the loss so far is mostly attributed to position sizing, but thats something I will work on in the future. 

I just want to emphasize it does not matter if I am right or wrong. More importantly this research is to identify if there are any trends worth following. Please do not argue below that I am wrong or right this is research and I am sharing the results. 

# Call Data

* Out of 838 Contracts 648 are calls (77% Calls)
* 56% of the calls are out of the money
* The out of the money calls are on average 25% out of the money
* The in the money calls are on average 20% in the money (probably because of the huge pump last couple of weeks)

# Put Data 

* Out of 838 Contracts 175 are Puts (23%)
* 86% of the calls are out of the money
* The in the money puts are 25% in the money
* The out of the money puts are 29% out of the money 

Just based on the above data is is clear that reddit is leaning heavily bullish into the 1/15 expiration.

"For all the 🌈🐻 s saying GameStop (GME) will go bankrupt due to gaming moving away from physical discs to digital sales, Daddy Ryan has already thought of this",0.93,"We all know that the 🌈🐻s are calling GameStop (GME) blockbuster because the gaming industry is going digital away from physical discs, etc. However, these peak autistic retards (and not in the good way) think that our lord and savior Daddy Ryan (RC) has not addressed this issue. RC has indeed addressed this problem. In fact, that's where the ***greatest*** opportunity lies.

First off, let me start with some speculation on where RC will be taking GME. There's a lot of speculation that GME will now become the Amazon of the gaming world as the one stop shop for all things gaming. Even if GME is unable to capture gaming sales due to the transition to digital sales, GME is still massively undervalued. GME's collectible business alone generated *737M* in 2019. Fucking action figures and shit. GME's market cap is roughly *1.35B.* Theoretically, GME running solely an online collectibles business would be undervalued right now. Don't forget, these  🌈🐻s are betting on *bankruptcy*, ie the stock going to 0. GME just needs to produce a sustainable business model to beat the shorts. Not only that, there's always going to be gaming hardware and supplies sales like consoles, controllers, headsets, gaming chairs. GME also sells TVs, monitors, gaming PCs, etc.

From the holiday sales update, we saw GME's E-Commerce sales are up over 300% and now account for 34% of company sales. This is exactly what RC is looking for. GME is already involved in the digital sales business by selling digital games, digital subscriptions, digital gift cards, etc. If GME were to truly becoming a one stop shop for gaming, people would use GME instead of buying directly through their console or PC because while they shop for PS/Xbox games using GME, they can also shop for games for their PC, all while buying gift cards for their friends or purchasing gaming subscriptions like PlayStation Plus.

But here's the real reason why people will use GME for purchasing digital games. *Online trade-ins.* Say it with me, you beautiful retard. ***Online trade-ins.*** In RC's open letter to the board, he wrote:

"" Significantly upgrading e-commerce can provide for greater revenue capture across larger gaming catalogs, digital content and community experiences, ***online trade-ins***, streaming services and Esports. ""

[https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC\_Ventures\_Letter\_to\_GameStop.pdf](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf)

GME's highest margin revenue stream is physical disc trade-ins. However, if GME is able to create a digital ecosystem where its customers buy all their digital games through GME across all platforms (PC, PS, Xbox, etc), they would be able to trade in their digital games for store credit to buy new digital games. For example, if someone trades in a digital PS5 game, they could use that store credit to buy a PC game. This would keep customers coming back for the same reason people go back to GME today. Furthermore, RC addresses the move towards digital by specifically pointing out ""digital content and community experiences"" and ""streaming services and Esports"". Daddy Ryan is here to transform GME, not just make what it's currently doing better.

Positions: 2000 shares at 18.64 (1300 purchased this morning after RC news), 1 LEAP ($25 strike, Jan 2023) - all positions purchased on margin like a true degenerate retard

TLDR: GME creates an online platform for customers to buy all their games digitally across all platforms (PC, PS5, Xbox, etc) and RC plans on giving customers online trade-ins for store credit to buy new digital games to keep them coming back.",2021-01-11 21:14:45

So if this agenda from ICR conference 2021 is correct, GameStop is no longer participating in the event this afternoon. Part of the reason why I think they pulled out last minute is because they don't want the bears to use this event as a catalyst for another manipulation attack on $GME.

GME already got a big boost from the Ryan Cohen board of members announcement and holiday sales release. This was probably going to be covered during the ICR event but since they released this info already they probably didn't have anything positive to say during the event so they would be just repeating the same thing. Just based on the consensus of WSB retards, if they went through with the event it may discourage the hype that was built this morning and gay bears might attack the stock due to their put options expiring worthless this week. This is probably a 9001IQ play just to fuck with the bears. If anyone else sees this in a different view please comment

Edit: Also, on iborrowdesk this morning the shares available to short was at 100. Yes fucking 100 shares left to short. right now it's at 10000 which is still very low compared to other days. https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME

Deeper look into Ryan Cohen's strategic GME move,0.95,"At face value, today was a great day for GameStop. However, upon a deeper look, its AN EVEN GREATER DAY for the long-term health of the business.

Let's talk about the current board makeup. Including the 3 new members added today, there are 13 members on the Board. Now, as was indicated in the 13D, ""the Board will be reduced to nine members following the Annual Meeting"", which is in June 2021.

Here's where it gets interesting. For a simple majority, there needs to be 5 members voting in a certain direction. Now, the 3 new members are obviously on Team Cohen. Who else?

Well, we have Kurt Wolf,  Managing Member and Chief Investment Officer of Hestia Capital Management. Given his Hestia's history with GME, he is most definitely going to be on Team Cohen. That's 4/5. So who else? Well, we still have Carrie Teffner, a director who has been on the board since 2018. At first, not much to see. Former CFO of Crocs, who cares.

Well, here's the great part. Before Crocs, she used to be the CFO of Petsmart. Who cares right? Let me ask you this. Who sold their business to Petsmart in 2017? You guessed it - YA BOY COHEN. Granted, she left before the business was sold. BUT, Petsmart had been looking at Chewy for years, and she clearly knows how good of an operator he is. That's 5/9. Game, set and match.

So there you go - a MAJORITY ON THE BOARD. Could things change? Sure. But this just goes to show how GME's long term health is in much better shape.

The above sentence seems to refer to the last quarter of 2020, of which the results are expected to be released this upcoming March. 

If they have actually managed to turn a profit in the last quarter of 2020, for the first time since several years and thus coming back from a position of structural losses, WHILE THERE IS AN ONGOING WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC, that is in my opinion quite substantial news! 

This means that even without Ryan Cohen (actively) involved management is steering the ship in the right direction!

&#x200B;

Alright GME Gang,

The haters are out in full force today, but remember that this is just the beginning. Think back to the numerous posts about RC and all the DD that was done. He has spent the past year cultivating and refining his personal brand with numerous articles for a particular reason and it's important not to lose sight of the long game here. The reason you love him so much is because of the halo effect that he's created.

&#x200B;

The RC campaign bus is just leaving the station and if there's one thing RC has proven is that he has the ability to get big money on board. Outside of a handful of funds, there isn't really any big money in GME at the moment and now with RC on board, you can bet your ass that smart money is going to take a closer look. Don't sell yourself short, play the long game if you don't need the money and watch as RC reinvigorates the Gamestop brand with all his youthfulness. I really wouldn't be surprised to see him become ***the*** brand ambassador, making headlines and TV appearances. GME is going to be the story of 2021.

&#x200B;

Remember, there wasn't a whole lot to bet on with GME, but there's a hell of a lot to bet on with RC. Smart money is coming your way. Bears...watch your backs.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Smart money will bet on RC turnaround. I'm on desktop so you'll have to imagine the rockets.

For you GME paper handers 🖕,0.95,"Literally the worst thing you can do to your stock is sell it at its lowest because you are likely to miss out on future upturns, especially when this is the week for Cohen to announce his big moves (not really but I'm sure he'll file a form 4 this week since he has to if he's been buying these shares in the last 2 weeks) 

If you don't believe me (fair enough I am on WSB) read this article by investopedia https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/021116/3-reasons-not-sell-after-market-downturn.asp

This stock is not going to be your friend who provides you with gentle comfort each day and quietly gets on with things. This stock is a friend who tells you that you're a lazy fuck and shouts at you till you get your shit together. It's the stock that makes you a successful bastard. 

If you're on margin trim your position fine but then buy at any dip. If you're holding stock then good work 👊 and if you're on calls then maybe start seeing if you can exercise your stock this week to help push this stock further and get rid of these theta gang twats.

This rollercoaster is about to begin and you better hold on for your dear life because you'll never forget it 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Quick DD for who ever wants to listen and make you quick tendies,0.77,"TLDR: SRPT 🚀

Ok, retards. So SRPT dropped 51% last week because they did not reach a main goal in one of their clinical trials. BUT this shit is normal for genomics and does not warrant a 51% drop. People got scared and sold and it’s looking to gain a minimum of 20% this week for a few reasons.
1. The JP Morgan Healthcare conference is happening this week and they will be there. The major point of this conference is to get institutions to buy invest. During this conference they will show how it’s normal to not meet main goals and will show their pipeline success which means they will land new investors plus old will buy on discounted price. 
2. All genomics go through this. There will be goals not met through the process. What is mainly important is how successful their overall pipeline is and their future work. You can check it out on their website. All indicators are great.
3. I invest heavily in this field and actually do research which is why I don’t throw my money at GME and PLTR to lose it.
4. A company just doesn’t lose half its value because of one goal not met in one of many on going clinical trials. 
5. 🚀

Just buy the stock and thank me later.

Edit: forgot to add there’s another class action lawsuit filed on Jan 7th. This happened at the end of 2013, which they bounced back from really quick.

Edit: CATHIE WOOD bought a shit ton of shares after the drop. And if you don’t know who she is just delete your accounts.

GME On That Moon Shit 🌝 - Technical Analysis 🖍,0.93,"https://www.tradingview.com/x/uiiqdYve/

You’ve seen every post talking about Cohen and the GameStop employee’s opinion on how business is going, cool cool. However, y’all MF’s need to understand why the chart is bullish AF!!

1.	Golden Cross - 50MA (green) crossing the 200MA (red) up
2.	The bottom is in, where do we go from here? MF UPPPP - that chart doesn’t show it, because I didn’t scroll back enough but it was on a downwards trend since Nov 2013. Then from Aug 2019 - Jul 2020 it was going sideways in an “accumulation zone”. Big money here was collecting all those shares from weak 🌈 🐻 paper hands. The accumulation zone is designed to break those hands and transfer those shares.
3.	Trajectory set to the 🌝 - GME started going up and then formed a beautiful upwards channel and we’re approaching the bottom support AKA THE YOLO BUY ZONE!!! 

At the time of this post, price on GME is $17.69. Smaller time frames show that it could still go a bit lower, but I’m no bitch and I’ll start accumulating my shares early tomorrow and average it out.

Short term price target at about $24 = 40% GAINZZZZZZZ

Long term, 🌝 🌚 🌙

The Real Short Interest of GME and other Details,0.3,"All you frickin autists who have no idea have been reading yahoo finance and shit to say that there is a 130%+ short interest in GME. I have spent a few hours looking into all this shit

1. The short interest is like 60%.

https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1346561814956552193?s=21

2. Legally, the passive investors have to recall their shares on a “material vote”, practically I think material isn’t defined. They didn’t recall their shares when there was a proxy battle between permit/hestia and the board. Only chance they recall their votes is if there is a go private, even then they might not. Not sure about this.

3. Don’t underestimate how long shorts can and will hold out. Look at Tesla. The passive investors DO have a handshake agreement as you can see in the blackrock PDF. Read the examples of Dell and Telecom Italia. Incidentally other

"They'll have to prize my GME shares out of my cold, dead, perfectly formed hands",0.96,"I want to add to the GME backlash-backlash by explaining why I'll never sell my shares as long as Ryan Cohen is in. I'm a bit older than a lot of you weirdos, and us Gen Xers might have an extra perspective on the GME saga that I haven't seen mentioned that often.

I remember **Pets.com,** and there's no reason why I should because I was busy going to raves and dropping E or whatever (i.e. studying). But I do remember it, because it was hard to miss. In 1998-99 it exploded as this dazzling symbol of everything that was vibrant and excitingly fucking totally mental about the dot.com boom. Amazon threw money at the startup, it had an enormous media presence and apparently a great online store, and it raised over $80 million on the NASDAQ (I looked at Wiki for that).

And then Pets.com so entirely and rapidly collapsed that it became a laughing stock for years. FOR YEARS. The parody ad that was aired during the 2001 Super Bowl was only the start. I don't live in the US (we couldn't even buy from the company over here), but I remember everyone laughing their heads off over the mess that was Pets.com.

And in the following years, when people were still wiping their eyes from crying or laughing at this god-awful lesson, Ryan Cohen was thinking about setting up.....a fucking online pet store. It should have been the last thing anyone would have wanted to touch. From my own limited DD, the granddaddy of US pet companies, Petsmart, had been a B&M store for about 15 years already, and the difficulties it experienced from 1996 meant it wasn't exactly a guiding light either.

So the 25-year-old Ryan Cohen decided to open Chewy and was abruptly - and logically - turned down by 100 investors. They smiled politely and ran a mile. But according to Cohen, he **'moved forward and never changed his business strategy'** despite having 100 doors closed in his face. Eventually, one of those investors got back to himself and cofounder Michael Day and said they liked the numbers and would throw a bit of money at the new company.

Cohen and Day proceeded to turn Chewy into a behemoth. Less than one year after being founded, Chewy had revenues of $26 million, though it was losing money, and then from 2014 to 2015 it grew from $205 million to $423 million, due to its focus on customer service and emotional connection etc. We all know about Petsmart buying the outfit for **$3.5 Billion** in 2017, only six years after starting up.

This whole story is the thing that sticks in my head, more than any hope of a squeeze or the likelihood of a slow, long turnaround under the current board.

And Cohen's latest tweet about the roller-coaster only adds to my possibly demented thinking, because in his keynote speech he gave to the Florida Venture Capital Conference in 2018, he compared growing a business to having a child, saying,

'It is a huge act of selflessness and dedication and if you are ready for it, **it is going to be a crazy,  crazy, crazy roller-coaster and it will be the journey of a lifetime.'**

So, to people looking at the excellent but pessimistic technical analysis, the gloomy outlook over the upcoming earnings and the conference tomorrow, and the hit pieces that are popping up at the moment like wildfire, you can shove them up your hole.

Ryan Cohen has a screw loose, and I'm betting on that beautiful screw.

GME gang need to prepare for a possible bloodbath next week and a long drawn out battle over at least 3-6 months,0.75,"Dear beloved GME gang, some of you might have read my bull erotica and although I'm not as chad as some of our dearest OG gme bulls, I'm afraid I turned bearish for the next few weeks. Here are a few reasons as to why

1. Everyone expect positive news coming from the ICR conference, however, given that management has failed to excite shareholders in the past, we really shouldn't expect anything different. Someone else posted that RC is not expected to attend the conference so I wouldn't expect anything spectacular. Sherman and gang will probably repeat the same thing they said during the last earning call.
2. We are also expecting console sales to come out this week, as  Uberkikz pointed out in his models, sales are likely not as strong as they should due to the ongoing shortage. Spoke with some random GME employee today and it sounds like shortages will continue until spring at the very least. This will hopefully just delay profits to later quarters
3. MM /Dealer option hedging flows. This is IMO the most important reason as to why GME will dump. The below is a combination of tidbits of things I learned over time so take it with a grain of salt, but know this.:[https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original\_271543791.png](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_271543791.png)yes I know it's from stocktwits, but this tells us something very important actually. Look at the overall put open interest. GME has a put/call ratio of 2.78,  total puts numbering at 19.359 million.  I've yet to see confirmed reports of exactly how much shares hedge funds like melvin capital actually shorted but I think the answer isn't as much as you think. Yes, they have bearish positions but they are executing on that with put options, meaning the actual short holders are the market makers themselves. (MM short shares as hedge based on delta of the puts they sold to these hedgefunds). If this is true this is gonna really fuck with our short squeeze thesis because MM has pretty deep pockets and they're not likely to be squeezed as they have  a huge margin, any expenses/loss they incur can be compensated for by selling high IV options, and quoting high bid-ask spreads on both options AND shares when transacting. I've been noticing that bid-ask spreads decrease substantially when we pump up into strikes with heavy put option interest and increase when we dump below those put strikes. Longs are getting double fucked by heavy put buying.
4. Looking at point #3 but in more detail, the options positioning for next week looks bearish af. On the call side we have pretty much all YOLO 30c bought at \~150% IV  + a bunch of other OTM calls. but on the PUT side we have concentrated 24P with OI of 51k, no doubt from our enemies at Melvin Capital. There is no question that all options are going to get IV crushed, the problem is that
   1. OTM call getting IV crushed will lead to a dump due to MM selling the shares the bought for hedging (decreased IV on OTM calls = decreased delta hedging = dump)
   2. ITM Puts getting ""IV crushed"" will lead to a dump due to MM shorting more shares (decreased IV on ITM calls = INCREASED delta hedging with short  = dump)

So yea, we gonna dump. Now before you retards go screaming to SEC about market manipulation, just know that we do this on a daily basis but with call options, driving shit up every day and getting stupid meme returns. This will be a long drawn out battle, and I suspect the GME squeeze might take much longer than anyone expect. Management will have to prove over time (hopefully soon) that they can turn the business around and generate consistent free cash flow, then one day be able to receive credit upgrades and reinstate dividends.  I hate boomer shit like dividends but it is my belief that dividends will actually cause a pump and short covering rally for the stock, because shorts are responsible for paying dividends.  If you look at historic short interest for GME, it pretty much went vertical when GME announced dividend suspension (check it on ortex around april - july 2019)

&#x200B;

Anyways, I think I wrote a bear erotica, but GME gang needs to understand this and if you're not ready for the long run you should GTFO. I REALLY HOPE I'M WRONG for next week. I really hope management can announce something exciting next week but the writing is on the wall for me. So I am making the following trades.

1. taking profit on my april 20c
2. Keeping my shares (small measley 500shares) but I'll be waiting for a pump on monday then sell ITM covered calls, then BUY ATM puts EOD monday.
3. As someone else pointed out, there's a gap down from 16ish - 14ish. I'll be selling puts at the $13 range in the hopes that I'll be assigned those shares.

godspeed retards

Update: You're free to keep your bull positions,  like I said, I could be wrong and I hope I'm wrong. In fact, if  you buy enough OTM (or ITM depending on IV) calls and pump us past 24 we'd probably start a huge rally.  But if you have shares you should probably hedge. If you got profit, nows the time to take some and re-enter at a lower price.  ",2021-01-10 08:07:20

FUCKED ON BBBY EARNINGS? WE WILL FLY AGAIN 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,0.84,"You have all corrupted my mind. My perception of the outside world is now filtered through the lens of stonks. So naturally when this appeared in my advertisement inbox, I knew this had to be shared with my fellow self-proclaimed autists/retards:

https://preview.redd.it/iqtb7uzhlea61.jpg?width=1036&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ccb6da014901b16a8cbaf11ddb1535e280e39019

My first thought after seeing this was ""fuck, I could outpace $29/year"". You'd only have to spend $145 a year? Easily done at BBBY.

Quarantine still going on and can't make it to Ashleigh's wedding? Beyond+ sub.

Virtual gender reveal for Carleigh's future POS kid? Beyond+ sub.

Kayleigh is about to go off to college for her first year of getting reamed by WSB autists? Beyond+ sub.

All no problem for BBBY Beyond+, now cheaper than using AMZN prime. And once quarantine is over people are about to go even harder for these exact life events. 100x more weddings, thousands of rona babies, and all the freshman about to fail out of college. Only a matter of time until we are back in the full swing of things and this subscription is fully utilized by the masses to ""save people money"" aka encourages them to spend more.

Edit: Take a fraction of how many people subscribe to amazon prime (as of December 2019, there were an estimated **112 million** U.S. Amazon Prime subscribers). Maybe a million Karen's? Cool. That's an easy $29MM, now say half do the math and spend the $145 to recoup the subscription cost. That's an easy $72.5 MM. I know you have to subtract shipping but still.

The Pot/Weed/Cannabis DD that WSB has been missing. Real roadmap to 🚀🚀,0.91,"Sup retards? Here's my opinions, make your own decisions. 

So I'll start with the TL;DR: Pot stocks are gonna 🚀💥🚀💥🚀💥 over the next 2 years and 2022/23 calls are future printers (or as early as 90 days) that even Elon himself will raise an eyebrow at. Decriminalization is just a layer of icing on a beautiful cake of banking reform. Also, Biden speaks on the same day Aphria presents at JP Morgan conference, big potential. Grab your helmet and HOLD the fuck on. 🚀💸🚀💸🚀

Okay retards, let's talk about weed. First off, some have mentioned this, but nowhere near enough. Since the Democrats took the senate, the next HUGE catalyst for the marijuana industry is the banking bill, this may cause bigger spikes in stocks than even legalization, as that will get priced in over time as momentum builds towards full legalization. Will stocks go up the day it is passed, absolutely. But will they be Powell level printers? Probably not. More like those busted Bitch McConnell ones. Basically like Pfizer's lackluster performance after saving the world. It was already priced in. So I believe pot stocks will do the same over a period of time. Meaning, again in my opinion, the biggest catalyst for Marijuana is the soonest change we can expect from our new government. I really expect this to be as soon as February and as late as July of this year, for the banking bill. Calls out to 2023 are extremely cheap imagining the upside coming, but calls in July might as well be BOGO. Do your own research as far as what timeline you guess the Senate will take. I'll tell you it was said that It will be addressed in the first session. 🤑🤑🤑🤑

Also, imagine basically any major company being forced to grow with no reasonable access to capital and no access to common tax write offs that every other company gets to use. Can they find debt currently? Sure. But basically at rates that a ""subprime"" lender would get, and then some. Access to reasonable and competitive capital is gonna be a game changer and allow them to invest and expand into things that are working in preparation of national legalization. Also, depending on how it all shakes out it may allow companies like Canopy (CGC) to purchase Acreage (A deal already made.) Or even better, companies like Marlboro to purchase Cronos (again, already a deal). Both deals are contingent on federal legalization though. 

Also, I really don't think it's a coincidence that Papa Biden is speaking at the JP Morgan conference on the same day as Aphria (Thursday, Biden speaks first). Any kind of renewed commitment to the M.O.R.E act or marijuana decriminalization from Biden would make stocks go on 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. Also, I expect Aphria's presentation to go well. Why? Well, other than being retarded, we have all been locked down for months. You really think stoners stuck at home are smoking less? No, 🐻🌈, they are not. They are smoking hella weed and playing hella video games. Weed stocks and GME Gang are about to do some Ricky Bobby slingshot shit when Biden locks everyone down thanks to Covid 2.0. 🚀🚀🚀🚀 Though, I have no positions in GME just to be clear. I pray for the MOASS to be bestowed upon you by Lord Cohen, but theres just no way marijuana stocks aren't %1,000+ gains just waiting on Senate approval for fucking blastoff. 🚀🚀🚀🚀

So, within the next 2 years, we can pretty confidently say we will have made huge strides for the marijuana industry under a vice president who was the senate sponsor for the MORE act, and a president who wants to make himself appear to fight social injustice. Those conversations are going to be hard to have without bringing up marijuana.  Also, a slow path to legalization would be decimation for the chances of small companies to compete considering the infrastructure and experience more established companies will have. Not many companies will be in a position to supply a meaningful amount to a national demand. 

In summary for Marijuana moons: Marijuana jumps again on news of senate vote for MORE act, could jump also if  Papa ""Don't touch me there"" Biden renews any marijuana commitments, MOONS when MORE passes senate, jumps on news of full legalization talks, and finally baby moons again for legalization and starts a nice slow climb into the industry it is expected to be. There's going to be a lot of scaling and growth for quite a while after legalization to meet supply. Companies with experience doing this already are going to be in a much better position than newer companies just frantically trying to meet demand. 

Which companies?? For me I personally like Canopy and Cronos. Why? Because I'm betting on Corona (Canopy) to do well with a cannabis product in a party/bar scene and Marlboro (Cronos) to do well targeting daily users. Marijuana may have been legalized in multiple states, but there's still barely any places for consumers to enjoy THC in a social setting regardless of what state you're in. There's massive business to be made here, once it is an option. Alcohol wouldn't be where they are today without bars. Regardless, just pick one, do what you can and I think there will be a pretty green number there very soon. 🤷 

Good luck out there retards and don't get in Melvin's van. He has the worst fucking candy, I promise.",2021-01-09 23:45:24

Hopefully you all took this week as an opportunity to average down, if you got caught buying at $20 a share.

Basically I was browsing the internet, bored as shit with the markets being closed, and found this gem of a detail, that I was completely unaware of. I’ve been long GME, mostly because of daddy Cohen, but this is just one more reason why I’m 💎✋🤚s on this beautiful stock. 

This news might be old, but as someone who looks at all the DD, I was surprised to see it. 

To keep it short, (hahaha fuck Melvin) basically GameStop has a partnership with Microsoft, and gets a percentage of digital game sales, and other digital purchases, if the console was purchased at GameStop. That means that all these new consoles that just keep on selling out at GameStop, will keep generating revenue for years to come, even if customers don’t come and buy games.

Yeah I get it, we have had a rough and painful fucking week. Every orifice we have has been smokefucked relentlessly by Melvin and his circle jerk penises hiding in suits. It hurts, but the bleeding will stop. Now suck it the fuck up. It's time to pack some gauze and toilet paper. Put your helmets and retard safety gear on because Ryan Cohen has us swaddled in his arms.

For all you raisin brains working your double fast food shifts and lacking the time to watch Ryan Cohen's twitter like the fat kid eyeing the last 5 donuts in your Krispy Kreme box, I have your back.

As we all know, a great leader doesn't show face 24/7, but they do come around when you are bent over backwards getting pillaged into oblivion by Melvin's STD riddled uvula puncher in a dark alley behind a Waffle House. This time is no different. Our savior Ryan Cohen just told all you dimwit-fell-off-the-shortbus-smooth-brains to strap in for a ""fun ride."" I went ahead and took a break from half chub jerking off to my friend's TESLA gains to reverse image search this high quality piece of treasure.

Massive Membrane Ryan Cohen took some time out of his day to search roller coaster memes and found this one. We have been instructed to ""keep arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times"". This isn't just some numbing gel to soothe the pain of our torn open and prolapsed assholes. ICR conference is next week and I know some of you weak handed semen squirters hopped on the ride and chickened out at a fucking loss, right before it started. You left your dignity in the same bathroom that you threw your shit-stained underwear. We are gonna go on the ride of a lifetime with enough action that you'll finally have something relatable to tell your wife's boyfriend. It's one that will make your chump pump inflate so explosively that you'll feel a sharp tug on your butthole.

Yesterday was everyone but us (and PLTR, sorry guys). Today was Tesla swinging their nuts like vibranium reinforced wrecking balls, knocking every sell wall out like Mike Tyson KO'ing your crippled grandma over the last bit of Chicken Tikka Masala... and everybody else but us again. However, our time to shine is almost upon us. Our balls drop next week and you might even get your first erection. When this rocket starts blasting, you'll go from your first pube to filming your first consensual orgy in record time. (Thanks Melvin for making me point out the sex acts you've forced on us).

For all you cowards that sold out of GME today and made some money. I am still proud. Either hop back in with more than you had before or go make tendies elsewhere and be prosperous. For you other sperm suckers that sold out of GME today at $17.08 because you have weaker hands than a sleeping quadriplegic, I hope you like giving throat jobs at truck stops for pocket change. Lemme do you a favor, if you sold out of GME at a loss and weren't up EOD, don't hop back in or your toilet paper hands will dissolve as soon as this girl starts getting wet and you'll just lose money all over again.

I know Melvin has done some damage and our assholes move like a blown sub and at this point, probably can't even hold in a fart. It's okay, sometimes making tendies causes grease fires and 3rd degree burns. If you want Melvin out of your guts, you better pull your head out of your own poopchute and throw up a ""Do Not Enter"" sign to prevent future mishaps.

At this point, I'm more excited to see Melvin capitulate into a ball of wrinkly old man writhing in despair and loss, than I am to see green dildos on my screen. Regardless LOAD UP THE FUCKING ROCKETS AND LIGHT SOME CANDLES BECAUSE IT SMELLS LIKE BITCH IN HERE. IF MELVIN WANTS TO STICK HIS ONE DROP WONDER PLUNGER INTO GME'S CHILI RING, P-UMP IT AND SQUEEZE THAT SHIT CLEAN OFF!!

I found that the automod was blocking the word ""quickcl0t"" of all the words in this post, which, surprisingly, took me forever to narrow down. It was initially supposed to be ""pack some gauze and quickcl0t"" but toilet paper had to suffice. I suppose it was triggering some sort of call to vi0lence bullshit so it took me forever to find out what was wrong and get this thing approved. Secondly, [/u/zjz](https://www.reddit.com/u/zjz/) and his VisualMod bot smacked me with using the banned ticker ""p-ump"" so that's why that shit looks stupid.

"Reeeeeeeeecap of recent market driving news (Jan 8, 2021 weekend Elon chan edition)",0.96,"* Elon chan has supplanted Bezos as the richest bro in the universe. This makes all quants who kept yapping about how TSLA pricing action via option gamma squeeze will subside once it's included in S&P screech in horror. Who knew the meme stock can continue its action unabated? TSLA hits ATH almost everyday this week, closing Friday up 7.84% to $880. Unreal.

* For a succinct difference of Elon chan's prowess vs Bezos, refer to chart below:

Elon | Bezos |
:---------|:----------|
Hot [goth gf](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3a/f1/d6/3af1d61d443906cb37f5ef92d34412b1.png) who will do kinky shit for him | Traded hot milf for botox lady so he can have dirty shit done to him |
Regularly flies astronauts to the fucking space station with his rockets that can fucking land themselves | Have to keep selling AMZN shares to fund his shit space company that's still dicking around with suborbital flight |
Talks about new gigafactory and everyone wants to give him sick tax breaks to build in their city/state | Shops for new second HQ to give high paying white collar jobs but AOC and gang gets up on his ass in asking for tax breaks |

* Morning economic numbers: nonfarm payrolls once again looking terrible, with consensus at about 50k increase but instead saw a -140k Dec. This ends a 7-month streak of steady gains in recovery. No worry fam, if you've lived thru March 2020 lows you'll know that market doesn't give a fuck about employment #s until you go all-in on calls. US reports more than 4k covid deaths for the first time ever - refer to above on why market doesn't give a fuck.

* Flurries of behind-the-scene political actions are happening as the country moves on from Y'all Qaeda's storming of the capitol. A number of high-level admin officials from policy advisors to cabinet members have bailed the sinking ship that is this current administration. Chatters of invoking 25th amendment. Second impeachment. POTUS has stated that he will NOT attend the upcoming inauguration (who knew he's a gdamn snowflake?), after finally putting out a statement that an orderly transition will occur. 

* Psuedo-SJW social media companies and platforms have banned POTUS in tandem, conveniently doing so after the Dems have clinched both chambers of Congress and will likely sit on committees regulating them. No real movements from these actions yet, though TWTR is pulling back after it banned POTUS for 12 hours until he deleted the offending Tweet. TWTR closed the day down -1.62% to $51.48, after an intraday low of more than -2%.

* BA got a slap on the wrist with a 2.5 bil fine from the DOJ for killing non-Americans. About 10% of the fine goes to the US govt while about 500 mil goes to the families of the 346 people that died in the two 737 Max crash. Remaining (70%) amount goes to BA customers because let's face it, corporations are truly the ones really hurting. BA closed down -1.32% to $209.

* It's a solid day for many Chinese ADRs as as BABA and TCEHY escape Treasury's list of delisting stonk. BABA closed up 4% for the day at $236 while TCEHY closed up 5.61% to $76.89. NIO, the TSLA of China (or is it XPEV? or LI? find out in 1.5 years!) closed up big at 8.55% to almost $59, despite offering to sell 68m more shares last month at $39. Surely the US market isn't going to be China Hustled.

* Today's big movers: DDD and PLUG continues their wild rocket moves to the stratosphere as strong market sentiment continues. DDD closed up 2.48% to $23.54, after touching an intraday high of almost 10% earlier. PLUG closed up 13% to $53.78.

* PSTH, Ackman's brainchild SPAC flew almost 12% today on ZERO news but faded towards end of the day. PSTH gang collectively jizzed and made a mess of themselves. Will it be Stripe? (it's not) Chick-fil-A? (it's not) Bloomberg? (eh they sorta denied it) Subway? (please god no). Find out eventually sometime Q1 2021 as Bill continues to edge us. Seriously Bill, announce something amazing already because I'm up more than 20k on zero news and I'm tempted to sell. PSTH closed up 7.24% to $29.32.

* In WSB meme stock land, a new law is being formed where none of these gdamn stock can go up together on the same day. PLTR faded to flat of 0.80% after being up more than 3% during early mornings, whereas GME and MT both fade some more today after a decent run-up attempt this entire week. GME close the day down -2.16% to $17.69, while MT pulls back from a week's worth of solid gain at -2.7% to $24.83. WSB's new meme ETF ICLN had some profit taking happened much to the displeasure of people who fomo into the ETF this morning, not realizing the sea of red candles were not bullish indicators. ICLN close the day down slightly to -0.75% to $33.15. Funny enough, OTM monthly calls haven't pulled back that much due to the magic of IV.

* While initially red through out most of the day, the DOW reversed course and closed up 0.18% or 56 pts, S&P up 0.55% or 20 pts, Nasdaq up a solid 1% or 134 pts, and RUT closed flat at -0.25% or -5 pts. It's the weekend and WSB newcomers addicted to FDs will no doubt flood the weekend thread, constantly asking if their $700 portfolio (funded in part by the $600 stimulus) with OTM calls will be okay. Don't worry new fam, stonk only goes up.

GME,0.93,"So today I went to gamestop first time in years. Literally just to speak with the clerk. As I asked her about PS5 and Xbox sales she said they were backordered into the summer. This was also, just the store's online orders. They only got 4 of the next gen systems for launch. I then went to GNC next door to meet up with my Chad bro and tell him my DD. At this point, the GNC guy proceeds to tell me a story about how he went to Gamestop during pre-orders for receipt paper (apparently GNC is having massive supply issues) and that he somehow managed to be in line perfectly to be put on the pre-order list for a next gen system. He was the ninth person in line per his words.

TL;DR GNC is bankrupt and gamestop has enough paper to give away to other struggling retail.

GME Fundamental Analysis,0.87,"We all heard about how no one could get their hands on the new consoles when they came out back in November. I thought the supply would have caught up by now, but just yesterday I heard a guy say that he tried to buy a PS5 and still couldn't get one. This prompted me to check out Gamestop's online store and sure enough, they have no PS5's or Xbox's anywhere. Heck, even the Nintendo switches are nearly sold out. I think Cohen is doing a good job leading GME into e-commerce and I highly doubt the stock can go much lower from where it currently is because of the huge $17 support right below the current price.

**5. After adoption of Rule 204, why are there still threshold securities and why is there still a threshold securities close-out requirement?**

**Even after adoption of Rule 204, failures to deliver may occur in certain circumstances. The appearance of a security on a threshold list does not necessarily mean that there has been abusive “naked” short selling or any impermissible trading in the stock. Delivery failures can be caused by both long and short sales. In addition, notwithstanding actions by broker-dealers to close out delivery failures, certain securities may remain on an SRO’s**[**\[17\]**](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn17) **threshold securities list for a variety of legitimate reasons, such as:**

* **Despite proper action to close out fails, new delivery failures from long or short sales, at the same or other broker-dealers, result in the security staying on the threshold list;**
* **One or more broker-dealers may have temporary but legitimate problems in obtaining the stock they borrowed in time for delivery;**
* **Long sellers may have difficulty in producing stock in good deliverable form to their broker-dealer.**

You retards need to read. Being on NYSE Threshold Securities for consecutive days doesn't mean they're doing an illegal short selling of a stock. It could mean that there could be a failure to deliver at the same or other broker-dealers.",2021-01-08 17:03:06

"Papa John's $PZZA - Make money, help franchise owners, and give Papa his company back",0.41,"First, to reduce any confusion, the company will be referred to as Papa John's and the person will be referred to as Schnatter.

I was joking about the idea to take over Papa John's with some of my friends yesterday to get Schnatter back in control of his company, and when I started doing my research I actually liked what I saw purely from an investment standpoint. This post will have two main parts: how we can get Schnatter his job back and also how we can easily make money on PZZA. We'll do the money stuff first.

&#x200B;

**Chart**

As of writing this, PZZA is currently trading at $94.10 and the ATH is $102.25. It is basically guaranteed that it will go back to the ATH. It has also sailed past the 20 and 10 day moving average, so there is no resistance until ATH. This is great for options.

https://preview.redd.it/s6klbqs2u4a61.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a797b3678678bd167818ee455dcde4d49f6e4512

&#x200B;

In addition, I suspect that PZZA could be forming a cup and handle pattern. If this plays out, the price target would be (ATH + (ATH - Bottom of Cup)), which is about $131.38. However, we won't know if this is a cup and handle until it happens.

https://preview.redd.it/umhvpr1ou4a61.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=b468ffd791469758f0679d390c4b6d72cad01a35

Even if the pattern fails, a delivery pizza restaurant is a pretty safe place for your money to be during the pandemic.

&#x200B;

**Other Numbers**

[Target price](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PZZA/research-ratings) of $104.50 with a high of $116.00. I think this is low going off the chart.

[31 million shares](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=pzza) float. I know that's a lot, but Schnatter already owns almost [1.3 million shares](https://ir.papajohns.com/stock-information/ownership-profile).

Guys, it's take out pizza in a pandemic it should really be self explanatory.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now we can talk about how Schnatter can become reinvolved with the company, which should help PZZA stock even more. As you will see, ever since he left the company has not been in as good of a position.

**Why Schnatter Left**

In 2017, he made a controversial comment about how the [NFL player protests were hurting Papa John's sales](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/22/572779230/papa-johns-ceo-steps-down-following-controversial-remarks-on-nfl) because they were the official pizza sponsor of the NFL. I don't want this to get political, but this is essential to talk about. Schnatter stepped down as CEO but remained on the board of directors. Fast forward into 2018, where Schnatter was reported to have [used a racial slur](https://www.forbes.com/sites/noahkirsch/2018/07/11/papa-johns-founder-john-schnatter-allegedly-used-n-word-on-conference-call/?sh=376e4e6e4cfc) in a meeting and it was recorded. Then, he stepped down from his position and no longer had a role in the company (besides for shareholder).

&#x200B;

**Schnatter's Fight for Innocence**

Ever since both of these allegations have surfaced, Schnatter has maintained his innocence and that his words were taken out of context. In a [recent interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lYGrUA6YjA) Schnatter had with the H3 Podcast (I know many people don't care for them, myself included, but those opinions don't change what Schnatter says in the interview) where he explained why both allegations were false. Regarding the NFL drama, Schnatter claims that he was talking about how the NFL had a leadership problem because they were not addressing the issue. [His exact words were,](https://www.foxbusiness.com/retail/ex-fbi-director-clears-papa-johns-founder-of-racial-bias-slams-clearly-inaccurate-media) ""*The NFL is hurting, and more importantly by not resolving the current debacle to the player and owner’s satisfaction, NFL leadership has hurt Papa John’s shareholders.""* In regards to the allegations of him using a racial slur, former FBI director Louis Freeh, wrote a [report](https://papajohnschnatter.report/read-the-report) where he explains how that in the phone call where he used a slur, he many times stated how he does not support any form of racism, and when he said the word, he was referring to how Colonel Sanders used it and it bothered him. There are two parts to the recording that Schnatter has been fighting in court to get released. The first part includes him using the slur and the context, and the second part includes the other people on the call celebrating after Schnatter hung up talking about how ""they got him"" and they needed to get it to the press right away. This is all according to the H3 interview. It is common sense that Schnatter would not want a recording made public that would damage him, and the company seems intent on keeping it secret, showing that they are likely hiding something.

&#x200B;

**Sales are Slumping**

[Sales are decreasing](https://www.statista.com/statistics/221441/papa-johns-total-revenue/#:~:text=Revenue%20of%20Papa%20John's%20worldwide%202007%2D2019&text=American%20pizza%20restaurant%20franchise%20Papa,seeing%20a%20decline%20in%20revenue) every year since his role as been minimized. It's as simple as that. They are in no way a failing company, they are just making less money than they were.

*Processing img 934fvr5jq4a61...*

In addition to slumping sales, in the [H3 interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lYGrUA6YjA), Schnatter claims that Papa John's total number of customers is down significantly and that the quality has decreased. He says he buys about 600 pizzas every 90 days from stores around the country to check on the quality. In my personal experience, I can say the quality at my local Papa John's has decreased over the past couple years.

&#x200B;

**Why Schnatter Can Fix This**

Schnatter is more devoted to Papa John's than most CEOs (after Karp and Elon), even though he technically doesn't work for them anymore. As I said before, he does frequent quality checks on the restaurants. The reason he does is is because he cares about the franchise owners and employees who have been negatively impacted by the new management and slumping sales. Who else still puts effort into a company after they've been fired from it? Also, this is just speculation, but since he is still closely associated with the company it is still his reputation.

&#x200B;

**What we can do**

It's simple, buy shares! If we buy enough shares of PZZA, we (along with Schnatter) can become the majority shareholder of the company. There are [just over 31 million shares float](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=pzza) and Schnatter still owns almost [1.3 million shares](https://ir.papajohns.com/stock-information/ownership-profile), or 3.88% of the company. If he can convince a few of the other large investors that it is in their best interest to see him in charge again, we can easily call a shareholder meeting, vote out those who wrongly accused him, and put him, back in charge.

&#x200B;

**Historical Implications**

Schnatter has long been touting ""The Day of Reckoning"" but has not given any hints as to if it has already happened, if it is multiple events, or what it will be specifically. If we can accomplish this, WSB would go down in history (it already has) again for giving a man his company back... and we will make money in the process. We can be the day of reckoning!

&#x200B;

**Is This Legal?**

Yes, it is perfectly legal. This would technically be a hostile takeover, which is legal, but we can just call it something else. Besides, I'm pretty sure Ryan Cohen is trying to do the same thing with Game Stop.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**

PZZA chart shows easy money, Schnatter is innocent of accusations, only he can bring Papa John's back to its former glory, and we can be the ones to do that. The Day of Reckoning is here!

EDIT: Here is a template to complain with Provided from [**u/Isthiswittyenough92**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Isthiswittyenough92/)

*To whom it may concern,*

*This letter serves to bring the SEC’s attention to suspected illegal activity in GameStop Corporation’s (ticker GME) trading. As a shareholder in GME, I have concerns about illegal naked short selling and increasing failure-to-deliver rates in the month of December 2020 through present day. GME has consistently appeared on the NYSE Threshold Security list for the last 21 trading days. In order to appear on the threshold list, a stock has to have 0.05% of outstanding shares fail-to-deliver, for GameStop this amounts to roughly 350,000 shares.* ***GME’s failure to-delivery rates have exceed this amount on most trading days in December 2020***\*.\* ***Furthermore, on at least three trading days in December,*** ***the total number of shares failed-to-deliver exceeded 1 million***\*. Below is a summary of trading days in December which had exceptionally high failures-to-deliver:\*

*12/1: 91,971 @ $16.56*

*12/2: 1,061,397 @ $15.80*

*12/3: 1,787,191 @ $16.58*

*12/4: 999,475 @ $16.12*

*12/7: 1,002,379 @ $16.90*

*12/8: 872,292 @ $16.35*

*12/9: 721,361 @ $16.94*

*12/10: 605,975 @ $13.66*

*12/11: 880,063 @ $14.12*

*12/14: 284,296 @ $13.31*

*Given the data presented above, I request the SEC to further investigate suspected illegal naked short-selling in GME, particularly as it concerns Melvin Capital, who holds a substantial short position in the Company.*

* Dems clinched the GA Senate run-off election as Warnock defeats Loeffler while Ossoff defeats Perdue (the first millennial Senator). As the results became more clear last night, futures took a deep dive particularly for NQ, while conversely small caps enjoys a favorable bump. The market opened deeply red for QQQ as big tech retreated with renew fear on antitrust probes  and overall an unfriendly corporate environment as Democrats will control WH and both chambers of Congress. 

* By early morning, the sell-off quickly reversed and big tech recovered most of their red, with big tech such as AAPL going from -3% to just shy of yesterday's close during day's high. In contrast to big tech, clean tech and weed soared on Dems securing the Senate. ICLN was up almost 4% during pre-market and as high as 9% during intraday high and HASI was up 10% during intraday high. Weed stock such as TLRY was up as high as 21%, ACB as high as 11%+, and APHA as high as 14%.

* Things quickly pulled back and tech started fading in earnest at 2:15 PM ET when protestors [cosplaying as revolutionaries](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106820104-1609961746992-gettyimages-1230453313-AFP_8YA6MW.jpg) stormed the capitol and Congress had to quickly pause their certifying of the Electoral College votes. Shit got real when a lady got shot as these protestors attempt to storm the [barricaded House chamber](https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1600/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F210106150417-03-house-chamber-0106.jpg) while Reps were still in the building.

* The sell-off accelerated for AAPL, AMZN, FB, MSFT, and NFLX as most drilled back to opening lows by EOD. AAPL closed the day -3.37% to $126.60, AMZN -2.49% to $3,138, FB -2.83% to $263, MSFT -2.59% to $212, and NFLX -3.9% to $500.49. Thanks to overall negative sentiment of all things tech, QQQ closed the day red at -1.39% to $307 (retreating quite a bit more than IXIC given the weigh of big tech in QQQ).

* Morning economic numbers had ADP reporting payrolls dropping to 123k in Dec, slightly below consensus of 130k. PMI was at 54.8 while consensus was 55.3, while factory order was up 1.0% MoM. Thankfully, none of these number fucking matters as the Dow, SPY, and IWM proceed to sky rocket with the market looking forward to stronger spending and stimulus from a Dem controlled govt.

* Beyond weed, clean tech, and infrastructure - financial sector killed it today in particular mid-cap banks such as ZION (up 11.24%), CNC (up 9.81%), and KEY (up 9.73%). You'll find a similar story for large-cap bank stock with JPM closing up 4.70%, BAC up 6.25%, C up 5.75%, and WFC up 7.08%. It's a good thing I've already dumped my reopening [WFC leaps play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kftjzt/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/ggarcbi/) of $25c and $30c which are now fucking ITM by $3~$8 and still have a year left to go on them. Nice.

* In yet another confusing about-face and showing a real Karen spunk, the NYSE is *really* delisting the three Chinese telecoms this time. The real kicker though came in at 2:25 PM ET when news broke that US officials are considering *more* Chinese stock delisting, adding Chinese big tech Alibaba, Tencent, et al. to the potential list. A sea of red soon followed to compound the sell-off as BABA crater to the Earth's core and closed down -5.32%. Following suit, PDD closed down -5.58%, JD down -7.66%, and the same goes for Chinese EV NIO at -5% and XPEV at -2.62%. LI escapes semi-unscathed and closed the day up 2.48% thanks to a new BofA coverage with a Buy rating and a PT of $42.

* In WSB meme stock land, GME was on track for a solid 8-9% day until the storming of the capitol occurred, PLTR's fade accelerated further while MT stays modestly flat, bouncing back from the overall market sell off. GME closed up 5.70% to $18.36, PLTR closed down -4.31% to $23.54, and MT closed up 0.32% to $24.70. ICLN, a new WSB favorite due to new balance of power in Congress might be added to future roundup if it continues to pump. Imagine that, a clean energy boomer ETF becoming a meme stock. The iShares fund managers are probably wondering why their alerts going tits up with social media mentions and sentiment brewing.

* Random trade ideas (these are not financial advice and if it goes wrong that's your own gdamn fault):

    1) FSLY leaps Jan 2022 90c or 100c+ for eventual TikTok climbing back fully onto the service as ByteDance pointedly makes a political jab at outgoing administration. Headwind on this retarded play: cloud/stay-at-home stock continues to take a beating as rona gets under control as vaccine roll out picks up. 

    2) Sell AAPL cash secured puts Jan 15 120p to 122p if the big tech fade continues rest of the week. These ~0.18 to 0.24 delta strikes are likely safe enough and if assigned, you'll have an upcoming ER on Jan 26 to sell IV pumped covered calls to get out of the trade intact. Feb 19 puts are likely okay to sell as well given you'll receive much more premium from the ~43 dte chains. Headwinds on this retarded play: its CSP and CC. As boomer as it gets. 

    3) BABA leaps and/or March debit call spread for another bounce in a wild trading week for BABA. March 230c/250c is probably a sufficient spread while baking in a bit of IV via ER which is on Feb 11. Jan 230c to 250c if you're not poor. Headwind on this retarded play: Jack Ma really is missing and the US govt really will delist a 600 bil market cap Chinese ADR, forcing out all major US institution holders. Yeah, right.

* The DOW closed up 1.44% or 437 pts, Nasdaq down -0.61% or -78 pts, S&P up 0.57% or 21 pts, and RUT closed up 3.98% (!!) or 78 pts. Stay in school kids and avoid storming federal buildings or Twitter will start banning your fucking account. (TWTR locks POTUS account for 12 hrs and is down -1.99% AH).

I have reduced by BFT position slightly to buy some of the Theil SPAC.

I have rolled my PRPL short puts from January 30's to February 35's. I still believe the next leg up will put us in the high 30's or even the low 40's. I expect some type of press release soon as the company has been silent for a long time.

PSTH- anticipated announcement in Q1, hopefully January. The six month mark is Jan 22nd.

BFT- Expecting a merger date announcement soon. CNBC's Grasso is back from having the corona and he is pumping it again. That along with a few big twitter guys will keep this on a lot of peoples radar. Paysafe is a solid play IMO, even if it doesnt shoot to 30 post merger. I am optimistic that we see 17/18 per merger and 25 post merger. This is purely a guess.

All my other positions are small. I've posted them all above. And no, I don't own GME- it might be the play of the century but I think I missed the big run.

GME (Long term Bullish) - If you're not already in GME then I don't recommend playing until you see a break at 18.10 (ish) with heavy volume. If it breaks resistance look out for 18.97-19.74-20.5 range.

If current support fails, look GME to fill a gap at 16.55-15.77 range. If it breaks 15.77 support then we f'ed. Watchout for 14.5-13.50. Anything below 13.5 and that means Cohen probably died or something.

If it breaks 19.74 then we moon to 21-23 range for this week.

TSLA (Bullish): Expecting TSLA to head down to 748 range since it mooned after hours and is near resistance BUT it could hit 757-765-770 because it's TSLA. If green support line fails we could see 740-733-731 area but would need catalyst and volume. If it breaks out of support with no volume then it could trade around no-man's land for the rest of the week while our calles get the theta treatment.

"Forget the SEC, I took the GME cause to the media",0.97,"Based on u/Isthiswittyenough92's [earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kr98ym/gme_gang_we_need_to_complain_about_naked_short/), I just delivered a similar message via Tor/SecureDrop to several news agencies' tip line: The New York Times, WSJ, Financial Times, Reuters, Forbes, Bloomberg, and...BuzzFeed.

I made it clear in the message that the SEC adopted the rules on naked short selling after the GFC of 2008, hopefully to get some journalist wet with click-baity anticipation, drawing a direct line of Wall Street incompetence from then to now. I'll either edit this post or create a new one if I get any replies back (depends on the reply). Will it makes a difference? I dunno, but I had to try.

Melvin was too blind (or too stuck) to cover back at $4, $8, $10...I'm here to provide them the research that their junior associates kids could've done. Hey Melvin if you want to pay me my hourly is on sale for you at $420.69 per hour.

It's been about 5 months of GameStop continually rising, and from those skinny orange lines the short position has not decreased at all. During this time, GME bulls have been blessed with a sleuth of positive news. Before we start cookin let me get all the ingredients into the pot for you guys:

# Tendie Recipe

[Provided to you by GME shorts](https://preview.redd.it/sg8apugjsm961.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=17bb70cb3f0a0c5c4bf91e8505e7655177ef15c5)

# Ingredients

1 **DIGITAL** revenue sharing agreement with GameStop  [(certified fresh by Domo Capital Management)](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/microsoft-will-give-gamestop-a-share-of-xboxs-digital-revenues/)

Xbox Game Pass subscriptions to taste [(15 million subs at $9.99 / month as of Sep 2020)](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449219/xbox-game-pass-15-million-subscribers-microsoft-growth).

1 acquisition of one of largest private game developers in the world for $7.5 billion dollars  [(responsible for elder scrolls, fallout, doom...)](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/09/21/welcoming-bethesda-to-the-xbox-family/)

# Cooking Instructions

You have to have a chef's vision to see all this come together - the goal is to stew enough Game Pass subscriptions to make more and more tendies later on. How do we stew more Game pass subs?

* Bullets below - More Game Pass subs = 🚀🚀🚀
   * Take the acquisition above and put some of their best games on Game Pass letting anyone on the subscription play it on Console or on PC.  Steam is on PC, and developers are starting to protest them.  Sony doesn't have a gaming subscription for cross PC-Console play. The digital future will have one master race there will be no console or PC - only game.
   * Partner with the only worldwide gaming focused retailer so they can push your products over competitors.  Sony has a bigger market share globally right now, but with GameStop, Microsoft sees its partner in crime.

Above you see how much money Microsoft can make ANNUALLY if they get more subscriptions.  Now back to the whole point of this, we need the last ingredient, that spicy Microsoft deal with GameStop.

GameStop get's a cut of Microsoft's digital Xbox revenue. Here is a quote from the article I linked above:

*""Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba confirmed that same basic outline to Ars Technica based on his conversations with GameStop management. ""The way it's going to work is for every Microsoft Xbox console that GameStop sells going forward, GameStop will get some percentage of the revenue from every digital full game download, DLC, microtransaction, and any subscriptions as well.""*

How much of a cut? No one really knows. After July I'll pay one of you paper hands to find out because you're most likely better at that then making this tendie recipe.  Let's speculate though assuming GameStop collects 3% of the revenues.

50 million annual subscriptions = Additional $6 billion in ANNUAL revs for Microsoft

Let's say that GameStop, because they're chummy with Microsoft, sell about 35% of ongoing XBOXs moving forward, allowing them to access the digital revenue share.

This works out to be additional $63 million dollars at almost 100% margins. And this is just from **subscriptions alone**.  How much are the rest of the DLC, microtransactions, and full digital game downloads worth for GameStop?  It's hard to know because Microsoft doesn't release detailed stats.  But let's take a look at their competitor so we can extrapolate [from Sony Quarterly earnings.](https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/20q2_supplement.pdf)

Unfortunately, my love and what very little money I can come across does not belong to inflating a company that has robbed people for so long.

This all said, I am here to share with you the only major hunch and play I got left; Nokia. I feel like it is severely undervalued, and for what it's worth, this is a chart-specific play...

\-Moving average and candlestick analysis-

7/16/2012, Nokia bottoms out at $1.63.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q7xnyyeswm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c7bcbb0221d8c69d85d364c77a930b7af0bd9d3

9/15/2014, a bullish correction/impulse tops out at $8.73.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1brpg9xswm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=d97f7ac1c12b6a6d0f89b3b64c7088ccdb42b7a7

&#x200B;

10/14/2013, Nokia broke above the red 200 MA, and on 8/24/2015 had a successful retest of it for support.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/88ray7itwm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=06b1887ef8318559b24735b34cdcff8b458b1478

Between 02/08/2016 and 04/18/2016, Nokia fought to stay above the red 200w MA.

On the week of 04/18/2016, Nokia produced a bearish doji candle at the red 200w MA and finally succumbed to large sell volume from gay bears confirming it as resistance.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vawm55ouwm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=f887e9f69e05c193357ff0e0585a60dee3fc1cc5

Since that candle, the price of Nokia has fluctuated in a large, 2,009 day range between a high of $6.65 and a low of $2.34.

The 200w MA has been tested and rejected 6 times, with the most recent occurrence being on the trading week of 08/03/2020.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uar1813vwm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=f31c2d379750c5116c196615bcb95bedd0b44c0e

\-Fibonnaci analysis-

Nokia has stair-stepped down from one Fib to the next ever since confirming the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement as resistance on the week of 01/25/2016.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o6dbdwivwm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=91bc2178b0c8d05b56705413ae1901dc2b01517c

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e7k92wzvwm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6b40681cefa6b65290d02ec3d68c70741fc4e0b

&#x200B;

Nokia then struggled from 02/01/2016 to 07/22/2019 for 1,267 days with breaking and staying above the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement. The 0.382 retracement during this time frame was also roughly the same area the red 200w MA resided, which provided confluence for the gay bears.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j9xzweewwm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=45f488b30cf0f9d122c775298800ea52b84e3cda

11/14/2016, Nokia very briefly broke below the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement and was very rapidly brought back up to test the red 200w MA. This major test of resistance was, yet again, a failure. From this moment forward Nokia was only able to genuinely break above the red 200w MA one time, 01/07/2019. After ranging above it for only a few short months, Nokia broke below and a subsequent retest caused a massive 42.29% drop in less than 4 months.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/etvy6bvwwm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e6f46a8038b393789966aa751c2d4bfa39145da

For approximately 3 months afterwards, Nokia attempted to regain upward traction. It was rejected immediately as soon as it hit the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, causing yet another major 48.34% selloff from Covid fears. This selloff yielded a low of $2.34, the lowest share price it has had in approximately 2,750 days. On the week of 07/27/2020, Nokia was able to again very briefly break above the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. After producing a low volume bull flag below the 200w MA, it was rejected to a low of $3.21. Since the Covid price of  $2.34, $3.21 has so far been the next higher low for Nokia and has since produced another fairly low volume bull flag.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z1lrfnj1xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=1854900a6c47ecb596d43eaf8643da4d8cc595cd

&#x200B;

For the retards like myself who can't maff very well, 2,750 days comes out to 7.53 years. During Covid, Nokia hit a fucking low that it has not seen in over SEVEN POINT FIVE YEARS. SEVEN POINT FIVE YEARS.

&#x200B;

\-RSI analysis-

This is where shit gets fucking \*interesting\*.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vwh8jmx1xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=a60db103050a04f08ff4ed4bb5773714a3e8f931

This is the weekly timeframe.

Notice the trendline. On 9 different occasions, Nokia has attempted to break above it only to be rejected and fail support tests.

On the 10th occasion, Nokia was able to have a minor breakout, successfully retest the trendline, and have a significant rise thereafter.

The 10th occasion has so far been the longest Nokia has been able to stay above this trendline, with 2 major successful tests of support.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1d2l1wc2xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=583631d853cc314794e4524fbe1979b9905d5d33

It is now battling with the bullish 50 RSI area for the 3rd time. Each of two prior tests of 50 RSI also coincided with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. That means this is a major zone.

After breaking back below the 0.618, the RSI trendline was successfully tested for support. It then bearfagged back up to the 0.618, only to nosedive on a high volume dump.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hx7jsnp2xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=54cefc4accb3d4ba9cdb8aab9cfdb686b27c234a

This is the 2 week RSI.

Notice how on 3 separate occasions, 60 RSI has so far been rejected. The first two occasions were roughly the same price point, while the third occasion was with a significantly lower high.

This shows hidden bearish divergence, which was likely a major reason for the price to have dumped so hard from its local high. One thing I have learned about hidden bearish divergence is that it is often an early indicator of buyer strength. It pretty much always results in a retracement, but thereafter, a fairly large rise. This occasion is so far clearly no different.

Notice also that there is significant bullish divergence in the RSI.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d5utlt63xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=500b6016b6dd1b8524e851ebd150168dac68bf67

&#x200B;

This is the 2 month RSI.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w8ck0em3xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=77b1582663e94cf7e91bb22587f1751a0f3855f0

50 RSI is getting hardcore rejected every time price causes the RSI to go anywhere near it. This is a strong indicator in my experience of accumulation.

The moment 50 RSI breaks on the 2 month RSI and there will likely be a very, very parabolic amount of buying support.

&#x200B;

My second favorite of this TA: the 3 month RSI.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i2z7gn04xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=71b056135b91044375d9f96ea8b502a230d4ec0a

40 RSI absolutely refuses to break, but hey, it has on a few different occasions. Notice the reactions in price however whenever 40 RSI breaks.

Price moons.

After a bullish engulfing candle starting 04/01/2020, 2 subsequent 3 month candles have so far been rejected at entering below 40 RSI, one of which having a very long tail and closing as a long legged doji. This is another strong indicator of reversal aka buying support. They also coincide with the 0.786 and near perfect closes below the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement.

Someone is accumulating.

&#x200B;

\-Patterns-

And now, my favorite part of this TA.

Have you been wondering what the big ass white line is for in some of my screenshots, or do you already know? They say when something is too good to be true, it almost always is. I won't ever give up hope that it isn't, however.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tm5z6lf4xm961.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4451933afe22fdd8e8874ea3350f9c3c92dac3b

&#x200B;

There are 2 white lines in this screenshot. Both are what I believe \*could be\* inverted head and shoulders patterns. If either one of them completes, they can very very easily jump start the next rise in this asset.

If the small one completes, the target for it will be the 7th time contending with the 200w MA residing currently at $5.07.

If both of them complete, Nokia has a minimum price target of roughly $9. IF however the $9 target is met, it will have over doubled the current price for this stock. That \*will\* cause FOMO.

I will admit, I've had not the greatest luck in spotting real inverted head and shoulders patterns. They let me down alot. :()

&#x200B;

Long story short, 1/20/22 leaps are currently at $13/$14 a piece right now on Robinhood.

If you pay $14 for a 12 month leap contract, you're essentially 'betting' $1.1666 per month that Nokia will make you money.

I find it incredibly difficult to believe you won't make at least SOME money on this play.

Especially considering months ago, this particular contract bottomed out at $0.12. It just did it again. Double bottom?

&#x200B;

I apologize ahead of time if anything seems off, I have checked and double checked this TA to make sure screenshots are accurate, etc..but I'm far from perfect. I guarantee you I fucked something up.

anyway, buy Nokia while you're waiting on GME or PLTR or NIO or whatever. Think deep in your thoughts what constitutes a *real* meme stock and **NOKIA?** ...

GME 4Q20 Financial Model Update,0.94,"GME GANGGGG!!! Most of you know I've been long GameStop since 2017, initially. I am an OG GME bull and yearn for our true value to be recognized by the market. RC Ventures sees it. Many others (Senvest, Michael Burry, Hedgeye, etc.) do as well.

But Melvin Capital does not. They wish we would file for bankruptcy so they can just escape this trade. Alas, they didn't close when the price was $2.57. Greed will be their downfall. But, they are smart. They see the data and for that reason I must enlighten you all about what I am seeing in the data, too. Remember though, one quarter doesn't make or break this thesis.

GameStop 4Q results will be weak, barring a spontaneous console creation event. Holiday results will be weak. The reality is while the future may be brighter than the wasteland the Melvin perceives for GME, the present isn't so great being at your core primarily a B&M retailer. It doesn't matter how in demand your products are if supply isn't there. I placed more notes in the image.

The reality is the order rate had been excellent earlier in the quarter and had been tapering for some time, spiking when resupply events occurred. I had trimmed my estimates previously, but given the continued slowing of the order rate (\~62k/day to start January) and viewing some US CC data that reflects a slowing sales performance as the quarter went on, it is my duty to share my belief that the forthcoming Holiday results will not be that strong. As I noted in my last post, there was also embedded console resupply included in my January base case, I have removed that assumption, too.

But let's not get too upset, fellow \*\*\*. While Melvin and its army of bankruptcy believers will spew forth vitriol claiming how weak sales prove nO oNe ShOpS aT gAmEsToP, the truth is they know what is coming from RC Ventures and will look to use any entrance of retail shorts into the trade as a means of  supply purchasing their shares from to cover some. The price may retrace if this proves true, however the reality is RC Ventures has bought at $16, and will likely deem a price under the 50 day MA as an excellent buying opportunity especially if they clearly communicate to the market that the reason for the price appreciation is Ryan Cohen, not George Sherman.

Look, it's a chess match, take the DD aside and think about it. Management reported 3Q and shares tanked. Ryan Cohen bought, and can be seen by observers as the primary catalyst for the upside move. Now, management will report Holiday Sales (and whatever else they have in mind at ICR \[I view a strategic partnership or a smallish technology oriented M&A play as my base case\]) and the price will likely dip next week. Do you believe Ryan Cohen won't take the opportunity to ramp his position up another 2% to 14.9% if the price dips below $15? He will file on Form 4 within two business days and show himself to be the savior, once again. I am speculating, but given the clear preference of WSB, Twitter, and StockTwits for #WeWantCohen its safe to say that retail is on his side. He will likely gather more votes under his own power and from those in alignment with his viewpoint. A forthcoming board slate would be publicized in early March. This is a war, always has been.

Play tactically if you wish, or 💎 ✋. I would advise against FD buying (in almost all cases, but especially this time). Here's the model.

I'd rather tell it like it is (as the data informs me) rather than put out BS. Hopefully I'm overly conservative. Call me \*\*\* if you must, but I'll own GME longer than 99% of you. Still have a price target of \~$100 by 2023. Cheers

EV play about to Rocket,0.58,"Sup fellow losers!

This is my first ever ""solo"" post. The pun will explain itself here shortly. I also think no one will read this unless I give a shoutout to my primary holdings, $GME. Like many of you, I have a rather large position in GME, but I have size available to trade other tickers as well, so feel free to click away if you got trapped thinking this was a GME post.

So, here is some DD on the EV play $SOLO...

First, I am from Texas, so I drive an ""eco-friendly"" Chevy 1500 even though I live in the heart of Downtown Houston and would never own an EV car that looks like SOLO's. Although, I am fully aware that my view is not what America and environment-friendly people like. That's fine. I plan on making money from your stupid looking cars. TAKE A LOOK AT THESE TRIPOD SOLO CARS, then come back to me. I guess people still drive Kia's after the hamster commercials and Fiat's, so who knows...

So the cool thing about this company is that the cars are only $20k, which is a good market for the broke Starbuck environment hippie employee who lives in a $2,000 a month apt in the city cause that is where the action is. This is a great price point for even the commuters into the city because it's a cheap car that they can drive only to work and back.

Ride Share. I am not sure about everyone here, but my wife loves riding the damn bird scooters, especially when she is drunk. Well, SOLO is trying to create the same thing with their vehicles. Pick up a small tripod and drive them around the city, then drop them off (OBVIOUSLY NOT IF YOU HAVE BEEN DRINKING!!!). This is perfect for people who have to pay to park in the city and don't want to lose their spot. You bet your sweet titties they will pay to rent a Tripod. Even I would drive one of these tripods around to see my boys laugh at me.

Tax Credit. Again, I am from Texas (if you ever met anyone from Texas, you will know because you will tell you 100 times), so I don't have state income tax, but hippies from the west coast could use all the tax breaks they can get. Now you can get a tax credit from owning an EV car. Well, $20k is a lot better than the price of a Tesla... again, I understand these cars don't look like Tesla's. But a wise man once told me, I am not gay, but $20 is $20.

Current Retail Footprint.  All in the west coast.... I WONDER WHY???

1. San Diego, CA
2. Brea, CA
3. Scottsdale, AZ — Kierland Commons and Westfield Fashion Square
4. Glendale, AZ
5. Santa Clara, CA
6. Walnut Creek, CA
7. Century City, CA
8. Sherman Oaks, CA
9. Portland, OR

Manufacturing. SOLO is a Canadian company but is expected to announce a new site in the US for manufacturing. Right now, they only have manufacturing in China. This is great news because now they don't have to pay import/export prices from China anymore. They have narrowed the search down to two sites, Arizona and Tennessee. After all, who knows what will happen with whoever our president is coming next month.

Chart Technical. Based on the below, currently while writing this the ticker is at $6.57. I think we could hit a new high of $15 with a small short squeeze and then back to $9. I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL!!!!

* Float: 24M
* 52 High: $13.60
* Short %: 12.23%
* Market Cap: 422.26M
* EPS: -0.28

SOLO is Presenting at the 23rd Annual Needham Growth Conference on January 12, 2021. So join in to hear more. This ticker is being picked up on numerous articles, some good, some bad. This is just my DD cause I never see anything on here about SOLO.

TLDR: STAY WOKE ON SOLO, price target $15.

GME Gang: We Need to Complain about Naked Short Selling,0.96,"As we've seen, there's been a lot of fuckery going on with short selling on GME. See these posts

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqf2g8/gme\_gang\_failures\_to\_deliver\_prepost\_wsb\_wsb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqf2g8/gme_gang_failures_to_deliver_prepost_wsb_wsb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kr02y8/gme\_gang\_18\_consecutive\_days\_on\_nyse\_threshold/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kr02y8/gme_gang_18_consecutive_days_on_nyse_threshold/)

Basically, it seems like there is a ton of naked short selling going on and no one is doing anything about it. Thus, I propose a complaint campaign to get someone (cough, perhaps a government body who was designed to look into shit just like this, cough) to do something.

We can submit complaints here:

[https://www.sec.gov/tcr](https://www.sec.gov/tcr)

There is literally an exact category for this (""Manipulation of a Security"" and then select ""Abusive Naked Short Selling"").

I'm a simpleton autist, I don't get fancy with my words but I've drafted a basic letter here that you can use:

*To whom it may concern,*

*This letter serves to bring the SEC’s attention to suspected illegal activity in GameStop Corporation’s (ticker GME) trading. As a shareholder in GME, I have concerns about illegal naked short selling and increasing failure-to-deliver rates in the month of December 2020 through present day. GME has consistently appeared on the NYSE Threshold Security list for the last 18 trading days. In order to appear on the threshold list, a stock has to have 0.05% of outstanding shares fail-to-deliver, for GameStop this amounts to roughly 350,000 shares.* ***GME’s failure to-delivery rates have exceed this amount on most trading days in December 2020***\*.\* ***Furthermore, on at least three trading days in December,*** ***the total number of shares failed-to-deliver exceeded 1 million***\*. Below is a summary of trading days in December which had exceptionally high failures-to-deliver:\*

*12/1: 91,971 @ $16.56*

*12/2: 1,061,397 @ $15.80*

*12/3: 1,787,191 @ $16.58*

*12/4: 999,475 @ $16.12*

*12/7: 1,002,379 @ $16.90*

*12/8: 872,292 @ $16.35*

*12/9: 721,361 @ $16.94*

*12/10: 605,975 @ $13.66*

*12/11: 880,063 @ $14.12*

*12/14: 284,296 @ $13.31*

*Given the data presented above, I request the SEC to further investigate suspected illegal naked short-selling in GME, particularly as it concerns Melvin Capital, who holds a substantial short position in the Company.*

Now as an autist, I don't even know if I've fully got the concept down but I think I'm close enough. Would love feedback if anyone with a big brain has any.

TLDR: Big money is playing illegal games on GME. We need to bring that shit to light

&#x200B;

Edit: because there are some people doubting the legitimacy of the actual complaint here, I am posting some actual sources. See this  [https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2011-title17-vol3/pdf/CFR-2011-title17-vol3-sec242-203.pdf](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2011-title17-vol3/pdf/CFR-2011-title17-vol3-sec242-203.pdf) 

specifically CFR § 242.203(b)(3) says:

""If a participant of a registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position at a registered clearing agency in a threshold security for **thirteen consecutive settlement days,** the participant shall immediately thereafter close out the fail to deliver position **by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity**"" This means the shorts should have been **forced to close their positions by now.** ",2021-01-05 22:14:40

"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news (Jan 5, 2021 after market close)",0.99,"* The market opened slightly red but quickly reversed because JPow realized this was no way to start a New Year, with Chadsdaq and S&P being propelled to green status thanks to Tim Apple and gang. DOW got further lifted by action from BA, GS, CVX, and INTC (who's really only being carried by MU). Small caps eclipsed SPX and IXIC today with RUT/IWM up as high as almost 2% during intraday high as value play starts looking more appealing. RUT closed up 1.7% and IWM closed up 1.61%.

* ""I'm totes not dead."" Says Jack Ma, according to a person familiar with the situation who's relaying the info to a CNBC  reporter on Ma's whereabouts. The beleaguered CEO who's in the crosshair of the CCP is keeping it easy and out of the limelight after running afoul of his overlords by talking up CCP's heavy handed action towards Ant Group. Who knew if your fucking financial empire touches the livelihood of 90% of the country there may be consequences if you don't toe the line. BABA closed the day up 5.51% to $240. Meanwhile, PDD touches new ATH and closed the day up 12.24% to $187 while JD is up 10.61% to $95.

* Many underlying in the Chinese ADR/ADS sector also gets a lift today partly thanks to NYSE's overnight about-face on delisting Chinese Telecoms. BILI hits new ATH and closed up 8.15% to $102.46 thanks to favorable reception from their secondary listing on the Heng Sheng while TCEHY closed the day up 5.23% to $76.66.

* Semi sector is on a run today thanks to MU, with Citi upping the NAND and DRAM manufacturer from Sell all the way up to Buy with a PT of freaking $100 as we enter another cyclical season. RBC Capital also raised PT from $57 to $83, Deutsche Bank from $75 to $83. Will MU $90 be back in favor and no longer a meme strike? Find out later this week. F in the chat for MartyMoho. If only he bought fooking shares and ride through two more additional cyclical season and a global pandemic. Ez dub. MU closed up 4.33% to $77, LRCX closed up 3.46% to $494, and AMAT closed up 3% to $89. MU reports earnings later this Thursday after market close.

* GM popped 2% when news broke at 10:29 on positive US sales number from Q4, and while shares were fading slightly as the market digest the news, eventually the positive momentum took over and shares closed the day up 2.84% to $41.66. ROKU pop to close up 5.44%, closing at $335 thanks to WFC analyst raising PT from $275 to $414 (yep) and keeping his overweight rating. 

* Today's big movers: FUBO was up as high as 21%, ~~M-A-R-A was up as high 23% while B-N-G-O drilled more than -30% during intraday lows after an initial halt in the early mornings.~~ FUBO closed up 12.83% to $27.35, ~~M-A-R-A closed up 23.43% to $13.59, and B-N-G-O closed down -31.25% to $4.95~~.

* The GA run-off election is on the market mindset as voters are heading to the polls. Meanwhile, Congress is set to confirm Biden's win over Trump, a procedural formality that generally receives little news coverage but not in the current timeline. Expect POTUS to rage over Pence on Twitter later tonight if the latter confirms Biden's Electoral College win. Look to weed and clean energy sector for pops if the Dems somehow wins both seat. No doubt many WSBer have already loaded up on FDs to showcase the sick gains porn tomorrow if the magic happens.

* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR is up more than 5% but those with OTM Jan 15 calls are likely having their ass handed to them by the greeks, while a similar story exist over at GME as the stock fades away morning gain to close the day up 0.70% as theta rampage $20c, $22c, and $23c (if your strike is even further out then RIP to you). MT and steel gang are faring better, with the stock retaking yesterday's high and closed up 2.84% to 24.63. Steel prices continues to rip and earnings will be early next month on Feb 11th.

* Affirm, the online installment loan lender for Americans who can't fucking afford whatever they're buying, is planning to IPO by offering 24 mil shares at $33 to $38 per share. With a market value of $9 bil, AFRM is sure to be a new meme stock in the coming days.

* The DOW closed up 167 pts to 0.55%, Nasdaq up 120 pts to 0.95%, S&P up 26 pts to 0.71%, and RUT closed up 33 pts to 1.71%. Notable numbers tomorrow: ADP employment report at 8:15 AM ET, factory orders at 10 AM ET, EIA draw at 10:30 AM, and FOMC minutes at 2PM ET.

"[GME] Better late than never potential entry plays, and how they interact with the current fight.",0.9,"I've been watching GME from the sidelines cheering on you tards but not getting in the game myself, and I'm sure there are plenty others doing the same. I have kept an eye open for some entry points, but typically do not do as much retarded yolo'ing as yall.

&#x200B;

From what I've seen, GME Gang wants us to buy shares, however I am wondering if there are specifics or limits as to how I would go about that. Particularly, if I was only ok getting in at a specific price point and wanted to Sell ITM Puts to do so and collect premium as well, would that impact the battle against Melvin at all (obviously my tiny wallet wouldnt, but lets say a ton of folks did the same).

&#x200B;

For instance, while its fairly dipped right now, if I was to sell a few cash secured Jan15GME20P getting an effective buy price of 16.65 per (including the premium), and buying as long as it stays under 20 by the 15th, how does that affect this on-going battle?

Again assuming the numbers were ramped up to a meaningful number, how does this interact with the Thresholdlist and failure to deliver stuff. How would it play in the larger picture with the pressure u/DeepFuckingValue would put with his 1k contracts on the 15th?

&#x200B;

If these shorts are being dicks and actually selling naked, my limited understanding would say, they could potentially be the ones buying my Puts, meaning they'd need the shares to sell me, and at the same time, they sold DFV's Calls to him, and would need the shares to sell to him, causing further pressure in both aspects, though for mine they could just neglect to exercise, but they'd be out the premium",2021-01-05 17:46:07

This isn't a goddamn walk in the park where your wife and her boyfriend put you on a leash and tie you to a post so they could go snuggle under a blanket in the woods. ITS FUCKING COMBAT. You know what happens in combat? SOMETIMES YOU FUCKING BLEED. I don't know how the fuck you guys are smart enough to open reddit but so braindead that you can't see that your tiny Trump hands are being mushroom stamped into submission by the big boys. 

This is **Catholic School The Play** casted by Melvin as the priest and all you dipshit retards are signing up to be the altar boys. Why don't you just bend over right here and willingly spread your ass cheeks until all your spare change falls out of your pockets?

Stop being so scared of a couple red days. Our brothers in arms over in Palantir have been fighting by our side for like a month and all you dumbfuck paper handed bitches start crying after taking a few shots. Get used to some red. Like your wife's boyfriend says, ""I don't mind ketchup on my hot dog as long as the bun is tight."" Well we know you small peckered bitch boys didn't cause anything to loosen up so we know he's telling the truth. Guess fucking what? THIS GME BUN IS SO FUCKING TIGHT IT'S GONNA SQUEEZE LIKE NOTHING YOU'VE SEEN BEFORE. Yeah, get ready for some blood red ketchup and keep jamming it forward. If you can't do that, go check out r/investing and leave your shriveled up raisin nuts on my desk as you head out. 

What do we all have in common? We are so fucking retarded that we can't even be reasoned with. Of all things to be afraid of, you guys are shitting your depends about a dude named Melvin. He might as well have been named Pubert because obviously his parents hate him. 

Who wins a war? A dude with a name as bad as Melvin, or a bunch of Wendy's fueled brainless retards chasing tendies with absolutely no concept of risk management? The answer is obviously us. We are so fucking stupid that nobody can calculate our moves. We are an unpredictable force. Instead of using TA or market sentiment, we just say ""hUrr DuRr StOnkS OnLy Go UP. Wow, I know 2 of those letters! All in for these FD's"" while we are pissing in a bottle and preparing to jerk off for the 8th time since breakfast. 

What we don't have in brains, we also don't have in capital. What we do have though, is something special. We are in a fight with somebody even stupider than us. They stand to lose more money than it would cost for your wife to be exclusive to you. 

Now for the final fucking time. Go change your diaper, prep for some ketchup on this tight bun and squeeze everything your absolutely retarded dimwit ass can find into GME shares. Stop getting cucked by Melvin and bitching about it left and right. We don't even have to say pleas, GME WILL FUCKING FLY AGAIN.

389 institutions hold shares in The Macerich Company. 

Institutional investors and hedge funds have recently made changes to their positions in the business. Aperio Group LLC boosted its position in shares of The Macerich by 48.8% in the third quarter. Aperio Group LLC now owns 407,430 shares of the real estate investment trust's stock valued at $2,766,000 after acquiring an additional 133,601 shares during the period. Advisor Group Holdings Inc. increased its stake in shares of The Macerich by 75.7% in the second quarter. Advisor Group Holdings Inc. now owns 149,133 shares of the real estate investment trust's stock valued at $1,338,000 after buying an additional 64,243 shares during the period. Vanguard Group Inc. increased its stake in shares of The Macerich by 2.3% in the second quarter. Vanguard Group Inc. now owns 19,822,696 shares of the real estate investment trust's stock valued at $177,811,000 after buying an additional 447,029 shares during the period. Mitsubishi UFJ Trust & Banking Corp increased its stake in shares of The Macerich by 102.5% in the second quarter. Mitsubishi UFJ Trust & Banking Corp now owns 62,834 shares of the real estate investment trust's stock valued at $564,000 after buying an additional 31,807 shares during the period. Finally, Bank of New York Mellon Corp increased its stake in shares of The Macerich by 1.2% in the second quarter. Bank of New York Mellon Corp now owns 2,164,136 shares of the real estate investment trust's stock valued at $19,411,000 after buying an additional 24,664 shares during the period. Institutional investors own 83.77% of the company's stock.

The top institutional shareholder in the company is Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board with over 24.56 million shares valued at $166.78 million. The investor’s holdings represent 16.43% of the MAC Shares outstanding. As of Sep 29, 2020, the second largest holder is Blackrock Inc. with 18.09 million shares valued at $122.8 million to account for 12.10% of the shares outstanding. The other top investors are Vanguard Group, Inc. (The) which holds 16.27 million shares representing 10.88% and valued at over $110.44 million, while State Street Corporation holds 4.77% of the shares totaling 7.13 million with a market value of $48.4 million.

The biggest takeaway for me is Blackrock ownership - BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager, with $7.81 trillion in assets under management as of end-Q4 2020 - these guys know value. 

If you don’t know who $MAC is:

Macerich is a fully integrated, self-managed and self-administered real estate investment trust, which focuses on the acquisition, leasing, management, development and redevelopment of regional malls throughout the United States. Macerich currently owns 51 million square feet of real estate consisting primarily of interests in 47 regional shopping centers.  Macerich owns some of the nation’s highest-earning malls, including Tysons Corner Center in Northern Virginia.

https://wamu.org/story/20/12/18/despite-the-pandemic-and-popularity-of-online-retail-shoppers-are-still-flocking-to-tysons-mall/

$MAC is an owner of a multitude of well-positioned, high-end shopping centers. 

We aren’t talking about your local mall that is half vacant and has been for years, their properties are high-end, destination attractions:

https://www.macerich.com/Leasing/Find 

The low interest rates benefit REIT’s and allow $MAC to do deals like this:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.inquirer.com/real-estate/commercial/preit-macerich-fashion-district-control-bankruptcy-gallery-20201217.html%3foutputType=amp

I know what you are thinking, malls are closed, no one is going to bricks and mortar, but as you saw above at Tyson’s Corner, people are out and shopping. 

Pent up demand + stimulus = profits.  

As of October 7th all 47 of the Company's major retail properties nationwide were fully open for business, now that LA County has approved indoor mall reopenings. 

In LA as of 12/27:

http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/docs/protocols/Reopening_ShoppingCenters.pdf

REIT’s - Real Estate Investment Trusts - some of the most beaten down stocks by the pandemic and this one, I believe has significant upside from its current price level.

What I like about $MAC is this:

Rent collections continued to improve, with collection rates increasing to approximately 81% in October of 2020 and 80% in the third quarter of 2020, up from approximately 61% in the second quarter of 2020.

Mall portfolio occupancy, including closed centers, was 90.8% at September 30, 2020, compared to 91.3% at June 30, 2020.   

Mall tenant annual sales per square foot for the portfolio was $718 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, compared to $800 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019. This sales metric excludes the period of COVID-19 closure for each tenant.

Average rent per square foot increased 1.8% to $62.29 at September 30, 2020, compared to $61.16 at September 30, 2019.

Approximately 93% of the square footage that was open prior to COVID-19 is now open and operating. 

Cash receipts continued to improve, increasing to approximately 80% in the third quarter of 2020 from approximately 61% in the second quarter of 2020. 

As of November 2, 2020, the Company has collected approximately 81% of rent for October. 

With continued improvement in operating cash flow, liquidity also continued to improve. 

Cash and cash equivalents increased from $573 million at June 30, 2020 to $630 million as of September 30, 2020.

Bottom line, this company is getting healthier and owns prime real-estate, with stimulus and vaccines upon us - the animal spirits are ready to be unleashed. 

What I like THE MOST above the value is the potential short squeeze that is coming (re: $GME and dare I say $TSLA). 

Short Interest (Shares Short)
80,670,000

Short Interest Ratio (Days To Cover)
14.7

Short Percent of Float
58.46 %

Shares Float
137,990,000

Lastly, I put this together for everyone that has said I’m just a “steel pumper”.

I’m anything but. 

I believe Tech has had its year in 2020. 

2021 will be the year of finding value with all of the current stretched valuations. 

Commodities, travel, shopping, real estate - they will all benefit from a weakened dollar, vaccines, stimulus and low interest/borrowing rates. 

Good luck and do your own research.",2021-01-05 02:56:04

Option Purchases Over 100K 12/23 - 12-31,0.87,"In this post I will be looking at major option purchases from 12/23 - 12/31. The goal of this analysis is to see if the 'smart money' is worth following or if they are just as good or maybe even worse than retail.

The criteria for this analysis is option purchases where the total premium is over $100,000. This helps me filter out the noise created by some of the larger retail traders. Additionally, I removed contracts where the expiration was last week as I think it will be more interesting to follow contracts that have a future expiration. This left me with a total of 735 positions entered between 12/23 - 12/30 where the premium was over $100,000. My data is collected over multiple sources and I do my best to make sure there is no redundant or false information.

The Columns to pay attention too:

* EXP: Expiration of the contracts
* Strike: Strike Price where the contract can be bought if it is exercised
* Option Price: How much premium paid per contract
* Premium Paid: Total amount spent (option price x quantity)

# Call Flow

[Call Flow](https://preview.redd.it/asn0bkz3de961.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=3365d254c4a27fe89e48f04324a8f46666459e5f)

To start I looked at call option flow. To simplify things I looked at the top 25 option call flows based on premium. Its worth noticing how many times TESLA is on the above list (8/25). Beside TSLA none of the call flow is really so reaching and for the most part pretty safe. The tickers in the above list are 'XPEV', 'CRM', 'TSLA', 'NKE', 'BABA', 'GM', 'PINS', 'BIDU', 'ZM', 'EEM', 'PLNT', 'MSFT', 'EBAY', 'SPX', 'MA', and 'DIS'.

# Put Flow

[Put Flow](https://preview.redd.it/ncsrdwq6de961.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=012a637965c0b17d98d990119d052ec22933efeb)

Some worth paying attention to on the above list are the SPY 2/19/21 354 Puts, QS 2/19/2021 80 Puts, CDLX 4/16/2021 PUTS as these expire relatively soon and would require a decent pull back to end In The Money. The tickers in the above list are 'PLUG', 'AAPL', 'SPY', 'ARKK', 'IWM', 'UAL', 'QS',  'LMND', 'CDLX', 'OLLI', 'GLD', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'QQQ', 'TAN'.

# Target Flow

The targeted option flow is calculated based on specific criteria I have used to trade over the last year. I call it Targeted Flow because this is typically where I find the best results. Essentially it is a mixture of volume, open interest, premium, expiration date and % move required. Interestingly out of all the options flow my algorithm picked up between 12/23 and 12/31 all of the ""Targeted Flow"" was Calls. As you can see all of the EXP below are for 1/15/2021 meaning the option flow buyers expect a big upwards move quickly.

&#x200B;

[Targeted Flow](https://preview.redd.it/040n3avbde961.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7b98cbe2929d39c27a068f58ed8a5f6a73feeb7)

Once again 8/25 Targeted Flows are TSLA. This really shouldn't be surprising, but I am amazed at how truly bullish TSLA is. Contracts on this list that I think are worth investigating are CSIQ, GSX, IQ, TSM and FDX, but do what you wish with this information. One thing that stands out to me in this Target Flow is that 69/69 of the option flow my algo picked up were all calls (as I said above). Typically when the market is leaning so far in one direction the opposite happens so it will be real interesting to see how the next two weeks play out. Based on how today is going I think we see lower over the next two weeks into the 1/15/21 exp.

Just for fun here is the TSLA call flow with over $100,000,000 in premium.... CRAZY

"QRTEA (yes, QVC) DD — A deep dive on the bull case for a solid value play",0.91,"Sit down and listen up ladies and gentlecucks, I have some fresh-off-the-griddle DD for you.

Let’s talk about QRTEA aka Qurate Retail Group aka QVC aka QxH. I’ve noticed nobody on here is really talking about this company but it’s in a very interesting position and is way undervalued.

Let’s get this out of the way:

“You mean the fucking company that sells shit to my boomer parents on TV?”

Yeah, *that* fucking company.

[OMFG it’s not a Robinhood chart](https://preview.redd.it/xc2dg3n35e961.png?width=1268&format=png&auto=webp&s=750d9e9a7a59ceeed81d49fd772e3887fe1ecbef)

[Direct image link](https://p-xbfzzva.t3.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/X6u0XKGp/90789e25-a889-40d5-bec9-3e8811fb2db3.jpg?source=viewer&v=656392fc3f711037dfeaa521ffa34f9a)

Real quick, let’s first take a look at WTF I’m talking about. You see that sad, sad 5 year chart above? Great.

**1. QVC:** ***that*** **boomer fuck of a company? And WTF is a Qurate?**

Okay so I can’t answer that second question. Is it supposed to be a play on ‘curate’? I don’t know, it’s fucking awful—but irrelevant. Moving on.

Over the past 5 years QVC has gone down the shitter. Which, well, duh—who the fuck besides your granny is buying stuff from a TV channel? The price bottomed out around $3 earlier this year. Oof.

But through a series of buyouts, mergers, and restructures between 2018 and today, they’ve strategically and, frankly, very quietly put themselves in a **great** position to make a significant turnaround. I’m not the only one who thinks so—you’ll see why below.

First and foremost, here’s the deal: their market cap is currently only $4.9B, which makes no sense against their revenues, which were roughly $13.5B in 2019. **That’s a P/S ratio of only \~0.35** aka THEIR MARKET CAP IS ONLY A THIRD OF THEIR REVENUES. The fuck.

[lol charts](https://preview.redd.it/mynaofv45e961.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c633025c0f000d9f6c0a9fff95098b3a7305490)

[Direct image link](https://p-xbfzzva.t3.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/X6u0XKGp/90789e25-a889-40d5-bec9-3e8811fb2db3.jpg?source=viewer&v=656392fc3f711037dfeaa521ffa34f9a)

In 2018 they increased their revenues dramatically YoY. But you’re probably thinking **so fucking what? I have eyes and can see in 2019 they had a shit year** and did the opposite of grow. Well…

**2. OMNICHANNEL. No but, actually, ecommerce.**

So first and foremost: In 2018, **ecommerce revenue became 58% of their annual revenues \[1\].** So they’re no longer just “that tv channel your senile grandma buys from”. **They’re a through-and-through ecomm company now.**

To go further, they actually own several ecommerce brands including Zulily. Y’all’ve likely seen ads for Zulily but I’m sure most of you have no idea what they sell. That’s because the target demo isn’t you, it’s mothers with young children, aka woman between the ages of 20 and 40. My guess is that that represents a few of you but the vast majority of you are basement-dwelling manchildren that would never use Zulily. I certainly don’t. But it doesn’t really matter **what** they sell…

My point is that in 2018 they grew their customer base by 24% \[2\] and in 2019 they released a stat noting that they have **91% customer return rate \[3\]** which is insanely high with that growth. Their customers are dedicated af and their customer base is growing rapidly.

What sort of P/S ratios do ecomm companies have in 2020? Well, let’s look at the “conservative” case, Overstock:

https://preview.redd.it/jiesgqa65e961.png?width=758&format=png&auto=webp&s=98f4c46af4728b51cb86e2e2d64949f8c857b1eb

Over 2x higher than Qurate.

“But that’s just one company. What about others?”

[thanks ycharts](https://preview.redd.it/60obqo275e961.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb073198e793423bd2693b8b1fb8323c7c362c60)

Convinced yet? No? Fucking fine, let’s keep going.

**3. Ferrari? No, Ferraro. (And maybe a Ferrari)**

Their shitty 2019 revenues were likely due to a massive restructuring where they finally merged HSN and QVC at the end of 2018 \[4\]. No surprise there, restructuring two behemoth old fucks is a big job. Money was invested. Revenues slid.

**But then at the end of 2019, they hired Leslie Ferraro \[5\].** Who the fuck is Ferraro? Oh, only the previous president of Disney’s Consumer Products division during one of their highest growth periods \[6\] and someone who was at the company for 17 years before leaving in 2016. This is a woman who has options, she’s not going to join a sinking ship after taking 3 years to make a decision about what company to join.

So she joined in September 2019, just before we kicked off our current pandemic, as president of newly-combined QxH, which is the combination of QVC and HSN (oh look, they have no real competitors in this space now). With her experience in marketing, licensing, and interactive media, she’ll likely be able to grow the digital and ecomm side of this business beyond its life as fading boomer TV telesales networks.

Even so, their revenues were still surprisingly significant which brings me to 2020…

**4. COVID-19**

When COVID-19 happened and we all got trapped inside and forgot what it was like to interact with other humans, like when you used to leave your basement to say hi to your wife and her boyfriend upstairs. This means your boomer parents and granny have been doing nothing but watching fucking TV and browsing the internet at 300% zoom. I don’t think I need to tell you why that’s good for QRTEA but just in case you’re too smooth-brained to understand: it means they’ve done incredibly well this year compared to 2019 and will likely outdo their 2018 revenues.

Just take a look at their last 10-Q filing: [https://ir.qurateretail.com/node/32576/html#BalanceSheets\_260982](https://ir.qurateretail.com/node/32576/html#BalanceSheets_260982) (big numbers, many words. TL;DR, numbers go from negative in 2019 to positive in 2020)

**5. Michael-fucking-Burry**

In addition to all of this, there’s my favorite kicker: sometime between June and September, Michael Always-A-Bit-Too-Early-But-Not-Wrong Burry bought **1.1 million shares** of QRTEA \[7\]. Since then the price has just bounced around a bunch and is still flat, but that doesn’t mean squat. This is a man with a plan and a fuckton of shares.

**6. The Dividends**

On November 20th, Qurate released an announcement that they’ll be doing a $1.50 per share special dividend, and a share buyback \[8\]. Presumably, this means they’ve been having a spectacular Q4, on top of a great three quarters leading up to that, and they have the cash to not only give a dividend but buy back shares.

https://preview.redd.it/fbandwh85e961.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&s=b48e4a8beb54cce18c18a682077d057c1bd3efb2

The day they made that announcement, the price jumped from $8.83 to $11.59 by the 25th. It settled in the $10 range after that.

**7. Lastly, Melvin Capital, those dumb fucks, and the battle of shorts**

I swear, it’s like they exclusively just inverse Burry’s positions. Or Burry inverses their positions? IDGAF. The point is…

Melvin Capital is holding $31M of puts \[9\] on QRTEA. They created this position in Q2 of this year \[10\] when the stock was between $5-7, so I assume they expected Qurate to go bankrupt (lol) and have put themselves in a really shitty position. They actually unraveled about $11M worth of puts in Q3, so that $31M position is down from $42M, I guess realizing they were immediately underwater and, perhaps, becoming aware of Burry’s investment.

As we all know, these folks will do anything to keep the price down. They’re already underwater and I’ve noticed the past couple weeks there has been a whale putting up a huge sell wall to keep the price below $11.30. Keep playing those games, friends. How’s it working out for you on GME?

**8. Conclusion**

So where does this leave us? We have a company that has a wildly undervalued market cap compared to revenues, has restructured itself into a real ecomm company, has brought on an expert at growth in the interactive and licensing space, has growing revenue during a pandemic and was perfectly positioned to take advantage of it and feed growth, and is doing so well it issued a special dividend and set up a buyback program. Michal MF Burry has bought in, and Melvin Capital is shorting it—which if GME is anything to go by, is a good sign.

**TL;DR: QRTEA is no longer a boomer company and the market hasn’t realized it yet so it’s still undervalued. Q4 holiday earnings are in February 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

**Position: 2300 shares, 500 $18.5c 4/16**

WSB vs Shorters (GME) SEC should get involved in potential price manipulation,0.91,"Post after post I have been reading about various data that indicates some type of stock price manipulation regarding short-sellers and the GME stock. I want this post to act as a place where we can discuss the legitimacy of these claims and what concrete steps we could take to make sure this potentially illegal activity is reported 

Personally the best idea I’ve read is to contact the SEC and to use as much information as possible to try and make a case for stock price manipulation. Link to SEC site where reports are filed: https://www.sec.gov/tcr

This post is mainly to organize these discussions and to form a master template which we can potentially mass send to the SEC to hopefully make sure this type of illegal activity doesn’t happen again if it is happening in this situation. 

Disclaimer: Don’t file any reports without evidence, this is exactly why I created this post and didn’t file a report myself. We need to make sure the evidence is there, and then we can build a case 

Short version: lets see if the GME stock is being manipulated and organize the discussion and evidence on this post so we can build a case if there is one to be made!

Every four $AAPL I see two $GME bullish DD,1.0,,2021-01-04 22:01:14
"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's (and recent) market driving news (Jan 4, 2021 after market close)",0.99,"* 2021 starts off with a bang as VIX shoots up an ungodly 22%+ during intraday high. During intraday low for the market, the Dow was down as much as -700 pts (-2.3%), Nasdaq -345 pts (-2.6%), and S&P -94 (-2.5%). WSB reeled in horror as stonk somehow doesn't always go up. Beyond renewed COVID fear, market sell-off accelerated in the morning after 10 AM as the market continues to keep an eye on the GA run-off election with polls increasingly being more favorable for the DNC candidates. No doubt an extra wrench was thrown to the GA GOP Senate campaigns as POTUS continues to pressure GA officials on figuring out votes - cuz that's totes normal thing for a sitting President to do.

* For those WSBer who failed basic HS civics class, just one GOP win in the two run-off Senate seats will keep Biden's more progressive agenda at bay (and likely the recent tax cut intact) as the GOP and McTurtle retain control of the Senate. Conversely, Dems winning both seats will secure both legislative branch for Dems, as VP Harris be the tie breaking vote in the Senate. Will this mean an eventual bigger stimulus package? A renew market-sell off? Should ANTM, UNH, and others quiver in fear? Find out later this week as results will unlikely be clear even after polls are close on Tues night.

* With renewed COVID fear as the UK variant likely running rampant undetected in the US, shares of travel sector are pressured today. In airlines, AAL closed down -4% to $15.13, UAL -3.75% to $41.63, and LUV -3.37% to $45.04 (similar price action across the sector for JBLU, SAVE, etc.). Cruise stocks took a bigger beating with NCLH down -6.69% to $23.73, RCL down -5.23% to $70.72, and CCL down -5.91% to $20.38. Conversely, safe plays and essential stores such as WMT, TGT, and COST are all up today at 1.65%, 0.62%, and 0.89% despite S&P being red.

* Jack Ma, Alibaba's very public CEO has reportedly been missing in action in the past few months as speculation starts floating about his disappearance due to the CCP. While memes float about of Ma being tucked away in a Chinese state prison with Randy Marsh due to pissing off Pooh Bear, shares of BABA continues to be pressured despite a rebound last week as CCP's antitrust probe on both Alibaba and its subsidiary Ant Group chugs on. BABA closed the day -2.10% at $227.85, while competitors PDD closed -6.13% to $166.78, and JD closed the day -1.79% at $86.33. 

*  QS, the SPAC turned meme EV stock took a nice more than -40% dive today as shares sold off on... well, who the fuck knows why it sold off (PIPE shares became available and are no longer locked? I didn't look into the lockup period, someone let me know the dates). The EV battery maker took on a NKLA-like trajectory and rallied as high as $120 before steadily trimming its gains in the past week. For those who are adventurous in selling the IV, OTM Jan 15 puts such as 35p are going for $1.55 while 40p are going for $3.3. But honestly, do you really want to baghold QS at those pricing if assigned (cash secured)? Go with a spread, you dumb fuck. Shares closed the day down more than $34 (-40.84%) to $49.96. If you sold puts before today, you dun goofed.

* QS edit: thanks to trojanattorney1 [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqi8e8/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_and_recent_market_driving/gi48nvd/): more early investor shares were available today and millions were dumped into the market. If you're trying to catch the QS knife, be warned as there are many more dilution to go. You can check recent filing [here](https://sec.report/Ticker/QS) if you're so inclined.

*  Haven, the AMZN + BRK + JPM venture in ""disrupting"" health care has disbanded after a 3 year attempt. Turns out having sensible health care in America is hard as fuck. Shares of healthcare companies UNH, HUM, et al. were up during pre-market and morning hours, but faded through the day as overall macro pushed the sector down.

*  In more ""I thought this is America"" news, more than 200 GOOGL employees and contractors in both the US and Canada have decided to unionized to promote a less shitty workplace and ethical business practices (once a upon a time, Google's motto was ""Do No Evil.""). Collectively known as the Alphabet Workers Union, the group's aim is to start small and eventually amass enough membership to actually address some of the more lofty goals: namely pay and working conditions. GOOGL closed the day down -1.51%, though more likely due to overall macro than this thus far non-material news.

*  Elon chan and his meme stock continues to kill whatever remaining short sellers are left, as TSLA reaches new ATH after Q4 delivery report. Despite the FY number being ""missed"" by 450 vehicles, the quarterly delivery of 180,570 vehicles handily beat Wall Street's estimate of about 174k vehicles and shares are up bigly to close up 3.42% at $729.77. How did we ever doubt those WSB degens who loaded up $3,500 strike Jan 15 calls pre-split which are now ITM!? Truly, they were ahead of the times in knowing that TSLA will shoot up an additional 76% in the next 3 months.

*  On Chinese EV side of things, NIO delivered 7k vehicles in Dec 2020 while XPEV delivered 5,700 vehicles - both numbers are record ""growth"" for the two company which shows a YoY growth of 121% for NIO and 326% for XPEV. (WSB with OTM FDs know these ""growth"" well as their FDs goes from 100% in value but are still down all-time of at -85%). NIO closed the day up 9.75% to $53.49 and XPEV trimmed their intraday high of 10%+ to close up 2.97% at $44.10.

*  In WSB meme stock land, things are a fairly mixed bag as GME continues to fade after reaching a recent 52-week high of $22.35. The definitely-not-going-bankrupt gaming retailer closed the day down -8.44% to $17.25. PLTR, despite being up more than 2% in pre-market, closed the day relatively flat at -0.76% to $23.37. Finally, steel gang got a respite today as MT closed the day up 4.59%, though intraday high was up as much as 8%.

*  Looking for cheap and relatively ""responsible"" WSB meme stock play? You can do GME covered call and sell April 35c for about $1.6 (though selling on a green day for $2+ is probably a better idea). This will net you 100 shares of GME for less than $15.70 per share and cap your imaginary gains at $35 if the squeeze does happen. (All those GME DDs can't be wrong?)  Conversely, you can go with GME April 20c/35c debit call spread for a ""low price"" of $2.4 per spread, or for those who prefer to sell FDs to fellow WSBer, poor man's covered call of Jan 2022 $25c and selling weeklies and/or April 35c will suffice. At the end of the day, the fact that April 35c has so much value still to it should be taken advantage if GME has a green day. For MT, June debit call spread is probably the way to go, with 25c/35c a possible spread. These are not financial advice and if you listen to a random stranger online and lose your pants on the play - then that's on you, you dumb stupid motherfucker.

*  DJI closed down -382 pts (-1.25%), IXIC closed down -189 pts (-1.47%), SPX -55 pts (-1.48%), and RUT is down -28 pts (-1.47%). Notable numbers and ERs this week: ISM manufacturing index tomorrow at 10 AM ET, BBBY reports on Thursday before market opens while MU reports after market close. Load up on those MU 90c for 7/20 - this time it'll definitely hit!

GameStop’s Greatest Ally: Norway,0.94,"&#x200B;

“What if I told you Norway could land us on the moon tomorrow” 🚀 🌕👨🏻‍🚀 

\- random autist 



**Norway** (Yes, we love this country 🇳🇴 ) has been a loyal and faithful ally to the United States for years. Norway joined the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and was a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949. You see, Norway is our OG friend.



*“But autist, why are you talking about history and not stonks”*



Patience, fellow retard. Rockets don’t lift off without a little commentary followed by a countdown... 3...2...1... 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 



So you see, our loyal friend Norway 🇳🇴 created a National Fund called ***Statens pensjonsfond Utland*** (SPU) in 1990 which has since grown to become the world’s largest sovereign fund valued at **over $1 trillion** (10 trillion Krone). For context, Melvin Capital only has $20b (**2% of Norway’s strength**) 



[Screenshot of GME's Top Holders. Norway owns 1.8 million shares of GME](https://preview.redd.it/gqrrm1c0ic961.png?width=439&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd767f9ed61c1afe1ec9312dee41568b6c5fa34f)



That means Norway is by far the **largest** and **strongest** retard in the room, and he has yet to wake up



But this is where things get interesting 🚀 



You see, Norway’s National Fund (SPU)'s goal is to “invest with an **extremely long-term perspective**, enabling it to cope with big swings in value in the short term. The goal of the fund on behalf of the Norwegian people is to generate the **highest possible return** with only moderate risk so that the fund grows and endures”



The fund only invests in companies with an extremely long-term perspective, and yet GameStop is one of them. You see, Norway’s National Fund currently owns 1.8 million shares which **represents 2.5% of voting rights**. On top of that, the fund is an **active participant in shareholder and proxy votes**. They frequently “have a regular dialogue with these nearly 1,000 companies” regarding shareholder decisions. They take the effort to be involved in their investments and will be active voting participants. 



*Where was Norway When the Buy Wall Fell?* 



**Ryan Cohen** 🚀  can call upon the alliances of old, our loyal ally Norway 🇳🇴. With the partnership of the century, the fund could increase their investment by a **small $100m** which would be enough to purchase another **5 million shares** (at a very conservative price of $25/share). This would be enough shares to bring **Norway’s National Fund to a 10% owner** (1.8m shares previous + 5 million new shares = 6.8 million shares out of 68 million outstanding). Norway  could then partner with Ryan Cohen to pull off the ultimate power play of our life time. 🚀   **This purchase would represent less than 0.01% of the fund’s over $1 trillion in assets, and would be hardly a drop in the bucket, but the move would give the fund a large upside exposure to the booming Gaming Industry.** As part of the partnership with Ryan Cohen, Norway could even become the center of gaming for all of Europe, with Norway hosting e-gaming tournaments, conferences, and events. GameStop could even partner with Norwegian gaming companies for partnerships during their e-commerce pivot. Imagine an annual gaming conference held in Norway on behalf of GameStop showcasing the latest in the gaming industry coupled with an e-gaming tournament for the coveted “GameStop Championship”. Ryan Cohen could hand out awards and accolades during the annual event, further boosting the GameStop brand name. You could even have the **King of Norway** 👑 (yes they have a king still) crown the champions for further publicity and even more PR stunts. GameStop is the brand name and recognition that everyone needs in order to launch themselves into the future of the gaming industry. 



You see, Gamers around the world have yet to be united under a single gaming hub, one brand name to encompass everything gaming to include buying games, consoles, hardware, swag, but also a brand for hosting, organizing, and sponsoring e-gaming events while also partnering with game developers to forge the future of gaming. GameStop could truly be the “stop” for all our gaming needs. 



With **Ryan Cohen and Norway combined owning nearly 25% of GameStop**, (and Ryan CEO with the blessing of Norway), shorts would completely back down, **decisively outgunned by the $1 trillion mega whale that is Norway**. This move alone would instantly trigger the short squeeze 🚀, but there’s still more to come which would leave the short squeeze as an after thought; the opening flame to the beginning of something new and awe inspiring.



 GameStop, absent the bears and shorts dragging it down would see a total transformation from brick and mortar store into the digital gaming world entering the future as the face and central hub of the gaming world; as GameStop was always destined to be 🚀 



With this move, GameStop would **\*instantly\* squeeze** and flush out all of the short sellers and bears. Melvin and the army of shorts 🌈 🐻 would be defeated (and bankrupted). Once the dust settles post squeeze, GameStop would easily settle in around at $50-$60 share price due to the market pricing in the new and unlimited upside potential. After RC takes the helm as the **captain of the rocket ship** 🚀, GME will continue to grow as it transforms and executes its vision, eventually surpassing $100 per share and onwards to $250 per share and beyond in the future years. GameStop would conquer the gaming world 🚀  



Norway could easily see their $100m investment return 2x-5x netting them a healthy $200m-$500m profit (perhaps upwards of $1.25 billion in the next few years) while also bringing additional money and business opportunities to Norwegian companies making the move way too good of an opportunity to pass up. A small 0.01% investment would net Norway easily a 200% to 1000% return (ROI) while also boosting the Norwegian economy, helping Norwegian gaming companies, tech companies, and tourism industries. 



We humble degenerates would simply be along for the ride of a lifetime 🚀 



TLDR; Ryan Cohen partners with Norway to spends 0.01% of their portfolio and buy more GME shares. Ryan Cohen takes over GameStop and our ally Norway becomes the home to all things Gaming in Europe boosting their economy. GameStop moons and we all experience the biggest gains of a lifetime 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 



Positions: GME 300 shares, 32 x $20c/$25c/$30c Apr, 30 x  $15c/$20c Jan, rip my 20c Dec 31 calls 



🌎    🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀     🌕 🇳🇴  👨🏻‍🚀

Why Index Funds are Not as Safe and Bubbles are Not as Destructive as You Might Believe,0.97,"According to Morningstar research in the middle of 2019 almost half of all US stocks were part of some passive index fund. This number almost doubled since 2009. In the meantime, active management is on a steady decline, especially active managed funds. Around the same time Dr. Michael Burry compared index funds to CDOs. Let’s look into this case and try to draw something from it for our benefit.

**1. How come index funds are compared to CDOs if they only track industries or sectors of economy?**

What we often miss is that the index fund, instead of being a neutral observer, is an active participant in the fundamentals of the companies that compose a particular index. The fund does so by providing capital and influencing market value of a security (this also opens a window of opportunities for the company behind the ticker to raise capital via bank loans or private investments). What’s so bad about this? Well, passive funds don’t go through balance sheets, there is no fair value assessment, no analysis and no risk taking. They just buy whatever company is big enough to make it into the index. This company can then use provided capital to stay afloat or influence it’s price by share buybacks, dividends or simply pay huge bonuses to it’s management. Just like banks didn’t care about subprime mortgages that were packed into CDOs, index funds managers don’t care about what exactly goes into their ‘soup’. With the banks it was just greed and ignorance – in case of index funds it’s by design.

When there is a stable influx of new capital into passive funds, zombie companies are dragged higher and higher. WSB goddess **Cathie Wood** called this the greatest misallocation of funds in the history. But why is so much cash flowing into index funds? Is it a trend? Is someone incentivized to promote them? Well, yes, but the main reason is different: boomer psychology and our friend, the FED. See, boomers have massive capitals. All those pension funds, retiring firefighters, trust babies, capital heirs – they all seek safety. They don’t try to get 500% returns YOY or lose it all. They are very content with just beating inflation. Throw few percents above inflation and they will be over the moon. For a long time their favorite asset class were treasuries.

**2. What is happening to the bond market?**

In 2016 US bond market was almost $40 trillion in value, compared to less than $20 trillion for the domestic stock market.  Now, I haven’t seen yet the data about the size of US bond market of 2020, but everything points that it’s ratio to stock market is deteriorating. The US 10-year government-bond yield fell from nearly 2.00% at the beginning of the year to an all-time low of just 0.31% in early March. That’s what Rick Rule called ‘return free risk’, since allocating capital into these treasuries almost guarantees you to lose money to inflation.

https://preview.redd.it/q6r2fhqfu6961.png?width=1372&format=png&auto=webp&s=b72fad038a47ee1a0adca587881f46bafc25cc89

Look at what is happening in Europe: “The ECB, which added 500 billion euros ($606 billion) to its pandemic bond buying program, is set to own around 43% of Germany’s sovereign bond market by the end of next year and around two-fifths of Italian notes, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. That’s up from around 30% and 25% respectively at the end of 2019... Trading volumes in bund futures have collapsed 62% since the ECB started buying bonds, according to Axa, while ranges the lifeblood of traders have nosedived across Europe. In both the safest and riskiest nations, this quarter’s spread between the highest and lowest yields is the tightest it’s been since at least the global financial crisis.”

The FED is doing quite the same. Buying bonds (including corporate) all over the place and lowering interest rates to the ground. What’s even more devastating for boomers is that there’s no hope on the horizon: the FED promises to keep interest rates low for the next few years. We are really heading towards Japan situation where the central bank is that fat ugly bully kid playing all by himself in the sandbox.

**3. Where to go if the bonds are not so hot?**

This all causes big money to chase the next best thing. What do people consider safe? Real Estate. And indeed it rose: according to Knight Frank Global House price index US housing prices rose 7% from Q3 2019 to Q3 2020. But that’s a lot of hustle for big money. And that is hardly a passive income, rather a career. So the next best thing is index funds. What can be better than tracking the whole US economy? Never bet against America, am I right? Even if we stumble upon a market crash sending S&P down – the economy will recover, it always does, right? The influx of cash into ETFs is basically a self fulfilling prophecy: it drives prices up and those yearly returns get even more lucrative compared to *sexy* 0.31% provided by treasuries.

[The data shows that 2019-2020 saw again a spike in passive management allocation, but I couldn't find more up to date graph ](https://preview.redd.it/db73yu15u6961.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d03efe94938505122915c672d823855b779f6ef)

Even worse is that actively managed funds and bank investments start to, basically, replicate index funds. That is due to the risk/reward factor: if the funds outperform the market - they get some good rep and few new customers; but when they underperform the market – they get absolutely obliterated. Only few outsiders can risk picking deep value stocks or plays, that are not common portfolio dwellers. Or it takes someone with huge authority like Warren Buffett or Howard Marks.

**4. Bubbles everywhere**

Now, at this point you might be on the edge of your seat, banging your fist and thinking that this is nothing but a bubble and the boomers, index funds and the FED are to blame. Well, it is. Hard truth is that fundamentals in the long run always kick-in. So-called Buffett indicator (total stocks market cap to GDP) is almost at a record high. And on top of that we have Dot.com bubble 2.0 with crazy tech enthusiasm. And a second real estate bubble too. But I urge you to notice, that bubbles are not all the same with the same outcome. Well, they all go burst, but that’s not the point. There are bubbles that I would call ‘General Market Heat’ - situations when too much money goes into the market, causing it to overheat. Then some sort of event, panic, fear, or rumor, not necessary caused by declining fundamentals, sends the market to downward spiral. As an example: panic of 1857, 1929, 1987, etc. The better the fundamentals were and the least the government gets involved – the faster it rebounds. Those bubbles do nothing but attract more speculators and their only result is the number of bankruptcies. Then there are bubbles that I would call ‘Thematic Bubbles’ - those are dedicated to some specific industry or a number of particular stocks that are expected to grow enormously. Tulip Mania in Netherlands (1637), Railway Mania in UK (1840s), Video Games Crash of 1983, Dot Com Bubble (2000). They all chased some particular novelty and all landed on their faces. But doing so they provided huge capital to developing industries. Dot Com Bubble gave us rapid growth of internet usage. Video Games chase of the late 70s and early 80s gave us the golden age of arcade gaming and huge inventions in graphics and game tech. Railway Mania left Britain with the largest system of railroads in the world. And guess who is the biggest exporter of tulips and holds 49 % of the global flower market? Yep, Netherlands, to this day, almost 400 years since the mania!

This did not in any way benefit the majority of investors who went down with the bubble. But you can view this as a sacrifice of dumb and greedy people for the benefit of the progress. I get a sense of pride in this noble cause, as a member of WSB community.

Back to boomers and index funds. By pouring money into index funds they provide capital both to disruptive industries and to zombie companies. The good thing is that the tech gets the majority of it, since it has the biggest share. Just look at the SPY top 6 holdings:

https://preview.redd.it/ien160wku6961.png?width=361&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4fb8528478110ff0f2d5f9e1a793d7b5e5a9085

It’s genuinely good that companies like Tesla will get allocation of billions and billions which they (frankly) do not quite deserve at current fundamentals. This will accelerate their growth. The bad thing is that such allocations cement big tech monopolies, damaging competition. And it also provides liquidity to zombie companies big enough to make it into indexes.

Difference is that innovative companies use this cash to reinvest into future growth. That’s exactly why their P/E ratios are so bad. Zombies spend cash on buybacks and management bonuses. Because of how all these companies are tied together in index funds and due to the nature of modern margin calls – once any segment of the stock market falls, there will be a massive dip. Tech can drown any industry stocks with them and vice versa. But the Tech will be able to cut investments, R&D and expansions and become profitable, while zombies with a big debt will go bankrupt. Either way it’s investors, who will bear the pain.

**5. What shall we draw from here:**

&#x200B;

1. There are huge inflows into the stock market. And the blame is not so much on the kids with RH as it is on the boomers and ‘smart money’ chasing index funds;
2. If you want to short any of the bubbles as a hedge – do not short the most growing and volatile sectors and ETFs like QQQ, because they benefit from the current market in a long run. And also the premiums are huge due to IV. Rather short slow and steady industries, because they will get nuked just as much in case of a crash, but the premiums you pay now will be much lower;
3. Passive index funds investing makes ‘price discovery’ and a search for deep value so much more challenging. But not impossible. Basically, Peter Lynch’s advise to look for companies with smaller institutional ownership still lives up today. Does this mean that prices can’t be good or go up under big index allocation? Hell no. But the chance to find a ten-bagger declines.As an anecdote: look into our champion’s GME institutional ownership: on Jan 31 2020 it was 96.6 % and declined to relatively low 66.7 by Sep 30. Exactly before it doubled in the next 3 months;
4. Some bubbles provide needed capital to developing and hyped industries causing structural change. Unfortunately, it is paid by investors who rarely see any return;
5. FED is to blame for everything (as always);
6. WSBers will lose money either way (as always).

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

**The bond market is similar to boomers wives: sexy in the 80s, not so much today. Constant intrusions by their relatives (the FED) into their relationships makes things even worse. That sends boomers chasing young girls - the stocks. But their dongles aren’t so active anymore, so boomers prefer passive approach, using a dating app - index funds. Unfortunately, there are only so many hot girls among young ladies on the app. This leads to ugly ones receiving attention and money from boomers, which they otherwise wouldn’t deserve. Some of those ladies spend money wisely and will be good to go once the boomer dies out. Others immediately waste it on shopping. Now, if a young man wants to find a truly beautiful lady with reasonable expectations – he has a better chance searching outside of the boomer dating app.**

GME DD from a Software Engineering perspective,0.89,"(Holding \~1500 of GME due to other DD)

However, a fundamental crux of GME's future is the development of ecommerce. This implies that GME needs to hire software engineers and really up their tech game so that [gamestop.com](https://gamestop.com) doesn't suck. They likely need xbox and ps5 apps, maybe a pc app as well that competes with steam.

To embrace digital, they need highly paid, highly skilled engineers that get to develop shit with the latest and greatest tech. Naturally, I searched for Gamestop Software Engineering jobs. The results are pretty lackluster and have me a little worried.

Not only are there very few job postings, but the postings available have shit job titles and shit job descriptions, requiring experience with dated technology. I'm hoping to see some departures soon and some Silicon Valley tech bro get hired to build out a proper engineering team. But as of today, the outlook is not good.

1. zero work from home positions
2. job titles:  ""**Advanced Engineer, Software"",**  ""**Lead /Web Department""**
3. experience required: ""Expert knowledge on related technical skill sets and technologies including but not limited to .NET framework 3.5/4.0, C#, ASP.NET, MVC, HTML, JQuery, JQuery Mobile, Javascript, VBScript, Continuous Integration Build, IIS 7.0, Windows Communication Foundation, AppFabric, Windows Workflow Foundation, Visio, TFS, REST, XSLT, SQL Server, and Agile Development Methodologies, Unit testing"", ""Proficient knowledge of web services and SOAP"", ""Knowledge of Microsoft BizTalk, Tibco, or other messaging platforms preferred""
4. [Poor salaries](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/GameStop-Software-Engineer-Salaries-E1162_D_KO9,26.htm)

**It is possible they are contracting a lot of work out to consultants and third-party vendors that know how to write code in the 21st century**. But currently none of the positions they are hiring for would attract any engineer that's actually worth hiring.

edit 2: No they don't need to hire \~$300K devs and create GME Cloud Services. But any devs they're hiring right now are probably doing more harm than help in the long-run. The thought is that RC influence would fix this. I was naively optimistic about it already being in the works.

TLDR; I am long GME but their ecommerce and digital future require a good software engineering organization. They currently don't have one nor are they hiring one based on open job postings. This makes my butthole kinda tight. I am sad to actually point this out. Thoughts?",2021-01-03 22:06:42

# Big picture

## 1.1 Macroeconomic View

I will be brief here, I think everyone knows what’s up basically.

[Figure 1: although the USD is worth a lot less, the S&P 500 is doing alright. Thanks Jerome.](https://preview.redd.it/iqtnlebs96961.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=056c4261f530831621fb22bf4f4bf199e5e21f6a)

Enthusiasm is the key word here as we are in an environment with a very accommodative monetary and fiscal policy (thanks for the stimulus checks). Equities and Bitcoin hit record highs thanks to positive vaccine news and the markets hope for a fiscal package. The Federal Reserve is going heavy on asset purchases, bailouts and loans. And its balance sheet is expanding as well as money supply. Interest rates are extremely low.

Check for example, the [Shiller PE ratio](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) to see the enthusiasm driving the markets.

On a macro-level side from the risks related to the pandemic, the only worrying signs would be the shrinking money velocity or a suddenly-rising inflation (hyperinflation is bullish for stocks but not for the real economy).

That being said, we know how the FED and the government reacted to support the economy and the markets. Low interest rates and weak US dollar which is continuing to depreciate is very bullish for stocks overall.

I keep the macroeconomic view very short for that GME correlation with the S&P 500 is low - about 28% over the last 6 months. Moreover despite GME’s heavy reliance on brick-and-mortar stores, GME continues to get closer to profitability even with the pandemic.

If the pandemic would make the stock market to crash again during the trade, I wouldn't sell at a loss but wait a few days and then buy a LEAPS. This is my plan. Don't follow it, just make sure you have a plan in case it happens, it's important to avoid buying too much the first dip (because you might get a better price later) or worse, avoid a panic-selling and take a loss instead of tendies.

## 1.2 Sector(s) View

Video game total adressable market and ecommerce total adressable market keep growing, that's all we need to know on a macro-level. Now, the real question is not about the market itself but about the compny business model.

* Short interest   68.13M (97.68% of the outstanding shares)
* Held by insiders  Between 13.6% to 27.3%
* Held by institutions  Between 110.5% to 122.0%

*Short-term the sector is pretty hot with quarantines and the launch of next-generation consoles which will impact positively year-on-year sales growth. The pandemic could have been an opportunity but GME has still too many physical stores and not enough ecommerce presence yet to take advantage of it.*

For the next earning release, the question is : how much PS5 and Xbox GameStop was able to get? And how much they sold in bundles (at high margins)?

Although it’s still unclear from what I’ve found it’s pretty bullish:

*GameStop Corp. employees across the country were caught by surprise on Saturday when the video-game chain suddenly announced new shipments of the highly coveted PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles* \- [bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/gamestop-employees-rattled-by-surprise-shipment-of-ps4-xbox](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/gamestop-employees-rattled-by-surprise-shipment-of-ps4-xbox)

The recent **Microsoft deal** is extremely bullish for GameStop and could help the company to reach profitability sooner than expected. Here are the details about how it could impact GameStop’s profitability:

* *In years 3 and 4 combined, if just 5 million customers extend the subscription for two years, GameStop makes $180 million in incremental profit with zero cost involved. That's nearly a quarter of GameStop's current market cap in recurring income at 100% margin*. - Justin Dopierala, “[GameStop Revenue Sharing Agreement With Microsoft Shifts Sentiment](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378623-gamestop-revenue-sharing-agreement-microsoft-shifts-sentiment).” SeekingAlpha.

## 2.2 Business Model and Management

* Gamestop is omnichanneling into **online activities** according to Ryan Cohen recommendations although it doesn’t mean they will execute it perfectly this is bullish.
   * “*GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences – not remain a video game retailer that overprioritizes its brick-and-mortar footprint and stumbles around the online ecosystem.*” Ryan Cohen.

[Table 2: GameStop is dangerously \(for the shorts\) getting close to profitability.](https://preview.redd.it/awmm34afd6961.png?width=562&format=png&auto=webp&s=e22229a87f8b29e59f43822c903a54893b9e3a6a)

* *The company attributes the losses this quarter to the end of the console cycle and the limited hardware and accessory availability that came with that, as well as various game delays, and an 11% reduction in its store base - partially offset by recaptured sales at other locations and online*. → **The company should be profitable very soon** **despite being priced for bankruptcy for a long time → Expectations are incrediblly low until recently, more investors are believing in the vision esp. with Ryan Cohen.**
* GME **e-commerce sales were up 257% year-over-year**.
* GME **reduced its selling, general, and administrative expenses by $115 million**.
* GME **repaid $10 million in debt in Q3 2020**.
* *GME is* ***diversifying sales to include more high margin items*** *like PC accessories, PC monitors, etc (If I speculate, there may be partnerships with certain brands).*
* ***Focusing on loyalty programs*** *like power ups and* ***rebranding***.
* As of Feb. 2020, GameStop had 5,509 physical stores.
* GME is **closing unprofitable locations**: they are closing 1,000 stores in Q1 2021 (by the end of March of 2021).
   * I’d like to quote a fellow GME gang member on this: *It's no secret that brick and mortar is falling off, and if GameStop were to fight tooth and nail to remain a largely brick and mortar retailer they would go bankrupt in no time. It is also a fact that underperforming stores drain cash, which lowers net income and thus lowers earnings per share. Any store that is LOSING MONEY or is barely breaking even is keeping the stock price down because it's preventing future growth and killing net incomes. Closing underperforming stores will lead to a higher EPS and more cash that can be allocated to growth.* \- horny131313.
* *Gamestop is rebranding, and shifting to becoming the one stop video game and video game related product online retailer. While we haven't seen exactly what this will be, it is bullish to see them pivoting into other products besides just video games. Headsets, TVS, PC parts, you name it. You've seen the omnichannel memes, but we know that If they are bullshitting, Cohen will step in. Expect to see real progress made.*

Some words from the last earnings:

* ""*We anticipate, for the first time in many quarters, that the fourth quarter will include* *positive year-on-year sales growth and profitability*\*, reflecting the introduction of\* *new gaming consoles*\*, our\* *elevated omni-channel capabilities* *and continued* *benefits from our cost and efficiency initiatives*\*, even with the potential further negative impacts on our operations due to the global COVID-19 pandemic.\*"" George Sherman, CEO.

Possible catalysts (from KYJELLYTIME69):

* A possible new Nintendo console release in \~1-2 years
* Currently distressed commercial REITs = ability to negotiate lower rent = more $$$
* Likely return of inflation (debatable but money supply ballooned and we are seeing velocity pick up a bit) with JPOW promising to keep rates at 0% even when inflation comes back = bullish for all stocks, bears will get slaughtered
* OG printer Yellen manning the treasury in a month + possible dem senate = more stimmy checks = more money going into GME
* If sales improve and balance sheets continue improve, we might see more credit upgrades
* Better sales = possible dividend reinstatement, I couldn't care less about dividends but guess who's going to be paying? The shorts lol. If Sherman had balls, he would pull an OSTK and announce a special dividend , which will actually lead to a short squeeze while wsb laughs collectively as we get meme returns from this boomer move.

## 2.3 The Short-Squeeze Thesis

&#x200B;

[Figure 6: Stare statistics from Oct. 2019 to Nov. 2020](https://preview.redd.it/juvh5y1bd6961.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=614c135c89f8d0e5a168e20c3e68cfd3005a5c7c)

**In terms of metrics**, the DTC (days-to-cover) actually decreases, lowering the probability to get a short-squeeze short-term. Don’t get me wrong, this DOESN’T mean that it can’t happen, the % of shares shorted is still crazy high.

**Days to cover**: *It gives investors an idea of potential future buying pressure. In the event of a rally in the stock, short sellers must buy back shares on the open market to close out their positions. Understandably, they will seek to purchase the shares back for the lowest price possible, and this urgency to get out of their positions could translate into sharp moves higher. The longer the buyback process takes, as referenced by the 'days to cover' metric, the longer the price rally may continue based solely on the need of short sellers to close their positions. Additionally, a high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze. This information can benefit a trader looking to make a quick profit by buying that company's shares ahead of the anticipated event actually coming to fruition.* (Investopedia).

**In terms of corporate actions**, here is a quote from September mentioning the hostile takeover from Ryan which would trigger a massive short-squeeze, here is the explanation:

***Short Squeeze Potential -*** *If Ryan Cohen successfully negotiates a purchase price with the Board then the shareholders will have to vote on it. Unlike the proxy battle where Hestia and Permit were running a minority slate of directors, an offer to purchase GameStop would force institutions like Vanguard and Blackrock to call in their shares. By doing so, the shorts would be forced to close out their positions and GameStop would finally have the greatest short squeeze of all-time. Ironically, Cohen could use this opportunity to sell all of his shares and use the proceeds to entirely fund the acquisition of GameStop going down as the first person in history to acquire a billion dollar company... for absolutely nothing. In fact, his acquisition price would be less than zero. It will be exciting to see how it all plays out as according to Bloomberg/WSJ there are now 58 million shares short as of 8/31/2020 with only 65 million shares outstanding.*

*If I were short, I'd be sweating bullets right now. This won't end well and will ruin many*.

**How to know when the potential short-squeeze could happen?**

* *Massive volume in short dated calls. \[...\] If you have shares, DO NOT SELL COVERED CALLS FROM THEM. by doing this you make the likelihood of a squeeze decrease.* \- horny131313
* U*nwind their short position with some behind closed doors deal. A scenario like this could include: Melvin offering shares of other stocks at discounted prices in exchange for GME shares or to unload a portion of their short shares. The second party to this deal could also offer to buy GME shares for higher than market prices* \- horny131313

If you want to do a further analysis on short-metrics I put some additional figures - you might find some kind of pattern idk.

## 2.4 Is GME Manipulated?

Maybe.

[I know there is actually a prob. with the &#37; daily returns \(it isn't equal to 100&#37; BUT the proportions still hold true on a non 100 point basis\). The main point is that: negative daily returns were much higher than positive ones.](https://preview.redd.it/xyzx8bl1d6961.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&s=efcf0647ba66214ff5fbb75f177f65d3cdb053d3)

If you are familiar with the stock market, you might have noticed that winners do not act like this usually: total return was +21% yet there has been 53.3% red days. If you look at regular stocks which have positive cumulative returns it doesn’t happen that often (outliers aside).

This is why I suspect that the stock is being manipulated but the weird stats might be explained just because the stock kept being shorted although it was not enough to keep the price down.

Another opinion on this:

* *Melvin and BoA both have short positions, and are desperately trying to drive the price down. Unfortunately, it is getting harder and harder to convince people that gamestop is a failing business. They are sweating and will continue to sweat. Given the buy side volume, they could close these short positions gradually without triggering a massive squeeze, however it WILL drive the price up significantly higher than it is now.* \- horny131313.

## 2.5 What 2020 Has Taught Us?

I think at this point it is the wrong question to ask (*is the stock being manipulated?*). To me, the most important thing is what is the upside potential and the risks associated? Then, how to trade GME?

* *If you're new to gamestop, the volatility will seem scary but the shorts fight hard with this one. -10% days followed by +20% days are not unusual.* \- horny131313

I would like to elaborate on this very idea. For this, check GME statistics for 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/t05xum2zc6961.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2e092560bba3b3091a6fe8bf0bceea2ce7b9f5c

* Whether the stock is manipulated or not, MOST of the 2020 trading days were negative.
* The worst daily returns were hard to handle honestly we are talking multiple worst than 14% daily drawdowns.
* You could more than triple your money WITHOUT LEVERAGE.
* Let’s say you bought late Apr. and sold late Aug. you could have been at -13% returns and +31% the next week if you had diamond hands. For the real diamond hands you had +147% returns the next 2 months.

Psychologically this was a hard trade for sure. But for those who had diamond hands, it was pretty amazing. If you don’t feel comfortable being at -20% or even -30% returns for months before the stock literally BLOWS UP… Reduce your position and diamond hand with a smaller size. Better to win with less than lose with a lot…

**TLTR: DIAMOND-HAND THIS OR DON’T TRADE THIS AT ALL.**

# Risks

## 3.1 Upside Risks

* RC Ventures LLC increases its stake.
   * It could be VERY soon. On the 31 December 2020, someone bought 900K shares, it could be Ryan Cohen given the size of its last purchases:

[ Figure 10: Last RC Ventures GME Purchases. Notice how the biggest numbers \(e.g. 800K & 500K\) while the smaller ones weren't \(e.g. 320K, 256K or 128K\).](https://preview.redd.it/j73tsjhuc6961.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=edd9813501b1af9aa9d0634702fcd4e2507e788e)

[Figure 11: Check who tweeted this on the same date as the 900K shares purchase?](https://preview.redd.it/9j3hgvksc6961.png?width=529&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a9188f79a155f4f97a29f3f48fcce02a3a93701)

**EDIT :** ***the recent 900K-share purchase after hours were not ""purchases"", it was quarterly option settlement.*** **- KYJELLYTIME69.**

* This is very bullish because after the disclosure of additional buying from Cohen last time, even though it strangely took 1 full trading day for the market to pop up, GME shot up 29%.
* Surprise investors with their holiday sales and/or EPS.
   * *GME will more than likely beat earnings next quarter. I won't go into much detail into this because it is not my expertise, however* u/Uberkikz11 *has done some amazing DD and has been doing so for a long time. This guy literally goes into GameStop stores to get his information.

* RC Ventures LLC gets more than one seat on the board.
* RC Ventures LLC begins a hostile takeover.
   * On top of its increasing stake, Ryan is supported by both a lot of small and now large investors too.
   * Moreover “*there is a decent amount of evidence that Ryan Cohen spent the summer of 2020 hiring a badass lawyer and crafting a pretty solid plan to wrest control of a struggling Mall-based gaming retailer from its out of touch Boomer Board and CEO so he can turn it into an ecommerce juggernaut like his baby Chewy. the attorney listed on each of the 13Ds filed by RC Ventures. \[...\] Chris Davis, Activist Attorney Extraordinaire and His Successful Use of the Consent Solicitation to Remove Dipshit Boards/CEOs”* \- CPTHubbard.
* Moody's Upgrades GameStop's credit rating a second time in a row
   * *Hoping for a PR soon confirming the recent redemption of the 2021 notes. Potential credit upgrade from Moodys could come now that GME has officially redeemed 63% of their 2021 notes. If we don't get that now, we should get it in March when the entirety of the 2021 notes are retired. Debt considered investment grade and not junk is a big positive and one most overlook.* \- Stonksflyingup
* Short sellers close a part of their position huge short position.
* A major hedge fund takes a significant position on GME.
* Dividend reintroduction.

## 3.2 Downside Risks

* New short sellers open a position and current ones scale up theirs.
* Momentum towards profitability dies out and the company goes bankrupt.
   * Honestly if you read this far you know this is extremely unlikely.
* Share dilution.

## 3.3 Overview

&#x200B;

[Table 6: Upside risks](https://preview.redd.it/e46jey6nc6961.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bdfbdaf27d5caaf93fea0973ff3f114ab875eee)

## 3.4 Commentary

[Figure 12: GME is one of or even THE most shorted stock for its valuation \(in terms of &#37; short interest\).](https://preview.redd.it/ag3sc9q9c6961.png?width=1023&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d55ae8902ba4f3cd3dd4120f698c077b75633ce)

This means two things:

* It is very unlikely for the shorts to continue to short the company especially when its credit rating is being upgraded - we will see if it keeps getting upgraded or not in March.
* If the shorts get to short it more (or new short sellers open a position) it will:
   * Drive the stock price down (lower market cap), drive the short ratio higher making the unwinding of the short sellers even harder and as a result making the probability to have a short-squeeze VERY BIG if good events happen moving forward.
   * Push Ryan Cohen to accelerate its plans.
      * *I will personally increase my share-position if it happens.*

# Conclusion

## 4.1 Prices Targets

Here is a summary of [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kow6gs/gme_price_targets_for_2021_according_to_the_short/):

When the short % of free float went from a high point (\~160%) at around February 2020 to a low point (\~140%) - which by the way are in absolute terms both huge numbers- the stock went up \~94% **BUT** most of the gain took place at 2 key moments: at the recovery of the market crash and then in late August which shows that 💎🙌-ing is key to capture most of the gains.

[Figure 13: GME returns from 3 Feb. 2020 to 1 Sept. 2020](https://preview.redd.it/5ysyfz35c6961.png?width=614&format=png&auto=webp&s=541ade007b74cb376a2477c6705c87999c51cdb5)

Why do I say this? Because when holding the stock you could “feel” like you bled when you watch the stats:

|Positive daily returns|Negative daily returns|
|:-|:-|
|49.3 %|50.7 %|

But IT WAS IN FACT THE SHORT SELLERS WHO BLED HARD:

|Best daily return|Worst daily return|
|:-|:-|
|23.0 %|\-13.7 %|

Imagine you sold GME when the -13.7% happened. You would not have captured the 94% returns. So just 💎🙌 and let those shorts go bankrupt.

**FAQ 1 : Is GameStop going bankrupt?**  300%+ yearly growth ecom sales, already closing top \~20% of their most unprofitable locations, high margin partnership with Microsoft, new gaming console generation, Moody's recent credit upgrade on 8 Jul 2020 from C (negative outlook) to B3 (stable outlook)... So extremely unlikely.

**FAQ 2 : GameStop employees complain about the company, so is the stock going down?** Well listen to Apple's iPhone manufacturers or Amazon employees... There is no correlation between their words and the stock price, if any there is a negative one.

**Positions**: shares, Nov. calls and some cash on the sidelines to buy the dips.

> “If a college student worked in 2020 they're still eligible,"" said Greene-Lewis. If the student files their taxes independently for 2020, they can use the Recovery Rebate Credit to get up to $1,200. Most students are also not eligible for the second stimulus check, so they can also use the credit next year to get $600.”

Many of you guys, like me, are claimed as a dependent by your parents—even if you’re basically living on your own as a college student and file your taxes independently. This meant that when stimulus checks were sent out, you didn’t receive the $1,200 you so desperately wanted to throw at TSLA weeklies. **There’s a way that you can get what you deserve.**

The Rebate Recovery credit is a tax credit that you can claim if you were a dependent last season. You can file independently this year and claim up to $1,200. Remember this when you file this tax season. And, ya’ know, get back at Mitch a little.

Along with the $3,000 in losses you’re gonna claim anyways, you can now also claim the stimmy money this tax season. Now, you won’t be able to pay back that loan your dad gave you; but, throw your tax refund into enough GME calls, and you may be able to return your account to even.

""GME GONNA BE BANKRUPT HUUR DURR"" - GME bears

If GME was going bankrupt, it would've done so already during the lockdown, not in the beginning of a console cycle. Here's a brief look at the credit markets backdrop and I'll explain why GME won't go bankrupt anytime soon and is in fact very bullish for GME.

I'm not gonna go into how GME improved their balance sheets and got FCF, lots of people did that already, but I'll say something in WSB terms. Printers go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR yo. When the IG and HYG credit market went to shit back in March and April, JPOW pulled out his magnificent printers and set it to BRR mode, the end result is well functioning credit markets with spreads that are tight af. With yields in treasuries and IG being low, people are forced to look for yield in junk bonds. This is why you hear about how CCL was able to raise debt without using ships as collateral and airlines using their flyer points as collateral to raise debt. Creditors are willing to lend at laughable rates  just to get yield. Now GME doesn't need to raise more debt, it is meeting it obligations early but if it ever needs to raise capital for future growth operations, they can easily raise capital in the credit market for as long as JPOW sets the printer in BRR mode. Which we know won't change until at least 2023, I honestly think it'll be longer than that  but it doesn't matter anyways since wsb doesn't even look 6 months out ahead. Notice how we haven't had as much bankruptcies as people thought we would ?(small businesses don't count) Well that's because of our great lord and savior, JPOW

So there you have it, betting on GME bankruptcy is essentially betting against JPOW losing control of the credit market. **JPOW is in effect GME gang's daddy #1**. (iloveyoujpow)

""BUT GME HAD NEGATIVE EPS FOR SO MANY YEARS!"" - more gay GME bears

You see the problem with bears is that they are always backwards looking, no vision for the future, no hopes for anything, always depressing. For some reason they can't understand that a lot of the market participants are writing off 2020 because of the pandemic, they also can't understand GME is cyclical and moves along with the console cycle, meaning we are now in the early days of a gme pump. Their inability to look forward is in fact the number 1 reason why their wives have chad forward looking boyfriends. **Our forward looking chad is of course Ryan Cohen (Daddy #2)**, I don't even need to explain more, but GME GANG daddy #2 obviously has a vision and he is more than ready to double down on his bet, buying GME at $16 just two weeks ago. He had a few mysterious tweets recently and people are speculating that he is ready to make another move. I'm not going to join the speculation  but the fact that he bought at $16 means that is probably the floor price and I would go all in with calls if it ever dips below that.

""THEY HAVE NO VIABLE BUSINESS MODEL IN THE AGE OF ECOMMERCE"" - Gay bear and Melvin capital

We have to give credit where it's due, Melvin capital likely had significant alpha with their investment thesis. If you look at their holdings, you'll see that they are long ecommerce and short specialty retail. They saw the demise of various brick and mortar stores back around 2015 and executed on that thesis. I'd argue that the covid pandemic essentially pulled forward all the earnings growth and priced in a lot of that growth with high PE multiples. The problem with that thesis is that it is now old, ecommerce is a crowded trade and this will not be an alpha generating thesis.  The best way to generate alpha is now to invest in a new counter thesis that can outperform the crowded ecommerce thesis.

Omnichannel is one of such counter thesis, it's starting to get hyped everywhere. This is why Sherman repeats that word like he's autistic, this guy probably mutters it while banging his wife but judging by his conference call, she's probably never been excited by him. Likely he doesn't know how to execute on that thesis, thank god for GME GANG DADDY RC.

That's not to say he is useless, despite all the shit we gave him. Sherman managed to close down unprofitable stores, reduced inventory and got cashflow positive during a pandemic. This is textbook shit but still very important. and despite the letters RC put out, he could be very receptive of his ideas for all we know. He has shown to be somewhat shareholder friendly through previous buybacks and he did not rule out further share buybacks. Sherman himself holds over 1million shares and has not yet sold them as far as I know. The shelf offering concerns seems to have faded for now, and it will become smaller as the stock price increases. I really just think GME management wants to use that to capitalize on any potential pumps in the stock. This will probably be re-invested anyways.

So what did GME do so far to improve its business model? So far I've seen the following

1. Pivot to ecommerce and improving ecommerce sales - which has seen decent growth
2. Diversifying sales to include more high margin items like PC accessories, PC monitors, etc ( If I speculate, there may be partnerships with certain brands
3. Focusing on loyalty programs like power ups - I'll never understand loyalty programs but some people are retardedly loyal to stores that offer rewards. If they can offer good incentives they can achieve high conversion rates , as far as I know, GameStop is the only specialty video game retailer in north America that offers such reward programs.
4. Store rebranding - this might be good for their goodwill, which got hammered over the years

Daddy RC has more plans for GME and we can only speculate what they might be right now, but with 12% stake, he has what he needs to go full on activist on the BoD. I expect to see some departures and replacements in the reasonably near future.

If that's not enough for you, here's a few more possible catalysts for the stock that I don't see a lot of people mentioning

1. A possible new Nintendo console release in \~1-2 years
2. Currently distressed commercial REITs = ability to negotiate lower rent = more $$$
3. Likely return of inflation (debatable but money supply ballooned and we are seeing velocity pick up a bit) with JPOW promising to keep rates at 0% even when inflation comes back = bullish for all stocks, bears will get slaughtered
4. OG printer Yellen manning the treasury in a month + possible dem senate = more stimmy checks = more money going into GME
5. If sales improve and balance sheets continue improve, we might see more credit upgrades
6. Better sales = possible dividend re-instatement , I couldn't care less about dividends but guess who's going to be paying? The shorts lol.  If Sherman had balls, he would pull an OSTK and announce a special dividend , which will actually lead to a short squeeze while wsb laughs collectively as  we get meme returns from this boomer move.

I'm sure the OG GME bulls can think of more reasons, I've been in and out of GME since it was at $9 (my CC's kept on getting assigned).

Current positions

500x GME shares - ready to buy more at the dip Monday and Tuesday, going to sell a few puts

15x Apr $20c 

10x  Jan 15 $20c YOLOs

So does this mean I think GME will squeeze to $69 by next friday? No. GME short interest has been high for years, Melvin capital isn't going to be that worried since their GME position is likely hedged and not a big part of their holdings (they're probably laughing at wsb for all the memes we put out). We will likely have a few more dips next week which I will buy. Depending on how much WSB pumps GME before ICR or console sale release (which I expect to be lackluster due to shortages), I'll either take profit or sell some ITM calls if IV's are high. Then buy the dip.

TLDR:GME bankruptcy is out of the question for the next 3-5 years because of the macro and credit market, RC is putting a floor of $16 on the price (debatable but you're welcome to buy puts or short below $16). bears need to stop looking backwards and be anticipatory.

I'm trying to look more into short squeezes and kind of put all the (justified) hype into historical context. What are some other well known short squeezes that could be used as comparisons? Others that have been mentioned to me: JMIA/OSTK/SFIX Squeezes

Everyone brings up the VW ""infinity squeeze"" which happened on only a 12.3% Short Interest and 6% of Free float at the time. 

But with GME the short interest is at a ludicrous 97.68% according to Yahoo Finance and the free float is 69%. So the VW squeeze was worse in term of the ratio of short interest to float

I know days to cover is the other really important one, but I can't find any numbers on what it was during the VW squeeze

I'm just trying to figure out what the most important numbers/metrics to pay attention to are

GME Price Targets for 2021 💎🙌 (According to the Short Float Data) 🚀,0.92,"💎🙌 GME GANG CHECKING IN. 💎🙌

Dear GME gang 🚀,

I wanted to share my Price Targets (PT) for GME but no BS here. I give you my PT according to actual facts.

Let’s take a look at the table and check when the short % of free float went from a high point (\~160%) at around February 2020 to a low point (\~140%) - which by the way they, in absolute terms,  both are huge numbers of course - I won't talk about the potential short-squeeze here (I will publish the ultimate DD on GME TOMORROW and talk about it in here, stay tuned).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f72yer03mx861.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=daf02cf200c7f1c1722a7e55dc6c02138f1dd2de

[www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4h6ff/this\_week\_will\_be\_the\_final\_blow\_for\_gme\_shorts/](https://preview.redd.it/zojf6rxwnw861.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=a535a48d71f7c0ec722e766018004eca4aa9c1b0)

The stock went up \~94% **BUT** most of the gain took place at 2 key moments: at the recovery of the market crash and then in late August which shows that 💎🙌-ing is key to capture most of the gains. Why do I say this? Because when holding the stock at the time you could “feel” like you bled all along esp. when you watch the stats:

*Positive daily returns:          49.3%*

*Negative daily returns:         50.7%*

BUT IT WAS IN FACT THE SHORT SELLERS WHO BLED HARD. CHECK THIS OUT:

*Best daily return:                   23.0 %*

*Worst daily return:                -13.7 %*

Imagine you sold GME when the -13.7% happened. You would not have captured the 94% returns. So just 💎🙌 and let those shorts go bankrupt.

Okay, here I showed **FACTS**. Stuff that actually happened. Now here is **my opinion about a reasonable price target** according to the data.

I think we could **easily** hit +80% over the next 6 months when the short % of free float will return to 140% it makes **a lower bound PT of $34 without a short-squeeze**. But this doesn’t even account for the fact that some short-sellers will not be able to hold from here. Keep in mind that some shorts have a triple-digit % drawdown already.

# Conclusion

**Price targets for the 3-6 next months according to the data from 2019-2020 (assuming the short float drops by 20%)** :

* Conservative:  $34 without a short-squeeze (+80%)  🚀
* Likely to happen: $50 without a short-squeeze (+180%) 🚀🚀
* Optimist:  $70 without a short-squeeze (+372%) 🚀🚀🚀

So I'd suggest that for those of you who DO NOT believe in a short-squeeze to put a take profit at around 70-80$.

Note that these are price targets assume the short % of free float go down to \~140%, if it goes to 130% or even less the price could go up substantially more. And...

**Keep in mind that my PTs are overall all VERY CONSERVATIVE given that:**

1. I DIDN'T even account for the fact that the next earnings will be good/great.
2. I didn’t even account for the fact that Ryan Cohen’s stake is now at 12.9% - those will NOT be sold, so the potential sell-pressure will be LESS than before = bullish.
3. With a short-squeeze I have actually no idea where this could go but again **very easily $100+**.

**I WILL PUBLISH THE ULTIMATE DD ON GME TOMORROW BE SURE TO CHECK THIS OUT (100% TENDIES, 0% BS IN HERE).**

**Positions**: a lot of shares. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Disclamer for the bears:  I only try to make the best PT estimations and share it with you all. I do my estimation, not by technical analysis but with actual data and what I believe to be the best hypothesis (short float will decrease by 20%). By no means I am saying I can see into the future unlike some people seem to think. I thought it was obvious but I must clarify it apparently. Anyway, I put my money where my mouth is and I share my personal insights that's it. If you really think I am wrong, by all means go ahead and buy some puts or short the stock, I'll be glad, the money you will lose is the money we will earn.",2021-01-02 11:41:10

[This tool](https://www.maptimum.com/tools/most-popular-options.php) takes all available options for a ticker into account and

1. Finds the top 5 options (call or put) with the highest popularity (open interest) across all strike prices and expiration dates.
2. Finds the most popular strike prices for calls and for puts (all dates combined)
3. Finds the most bullish and the most bearish days. I define the most bullish days as the days with the highest surplus of deep (strike 10% above current price) OTM calls to deep OTM puts (strike 10% below current price).
4. Cheapest/Most Expensive options.

This can help you decide quickly what option to go for if you're the type of person who feels more comfortable following the crowd.

Here are the results for [GME](https://www.maptimum.com/tools/most-popular-options.php?ticker=GME): Most popular option: 24P 1/15/2021, Most bullish day: 2/19/2021, Most bearish day: 1/8/2021

PS1. Sometimes you may see strike prices that look weird. For example, a strike price of $5 for a stock that is trading in the $100s. That's because such options were generated a long time ago when the stock price was much lower.

PS2. Yahoo Finance API only takes \~2000 requests per hour. Since a lot of you may have been using the tool today, it may go over the limit sometimes and therefore not work properly. But once this wave subsides the app should be back to normal.

Okay, since you know that I'm obsessed and literally Can't Stop, Won't Stop, GameStop! ...

It's irrefutable that supply, whether through managerial operational failings, or lost market share, or outside their control due to Covid, is weighing on sales. Whenever there's been console supply especially the uptick in sales is notable and somewhat durable in the order rate data (many thanks once again GME Gang for the steady influx of [GameStop.com](https://GameStop.com) order #s!!!

Potential in coming real estate dip in 2021. Are there any non-idiots among us that work in this space and want to share their thoughts?,0.9,"TLDR: I have no fucking clue what I am talking about. It looks like the housing market is ready to decline in late 2021, maybe as soon as the spring. I am considering selling my rental house soon... obviously so I can yolo more into GME, PLTR, and SPCE - I can't help myself and I don't want help. If this happens, REITs might dip further, making for a nice entry point.

&#x200B;

Home prices have been steadily rising the last five or so years to the point  we are seeing a spike in the inflation adjusted housing costs. It looks  like we are at the 07/08 highs again.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r6on75066t861.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bac32713ff598bab5431b52ae7d8e45332340ba

I have been following the forbearance rates since covid started, and it looks like many of the national lenders have forbearance rates in the 3-6% range, still.  Historically these are under 1% for all lenders. If these eventually  turn into delinquencies after the forbearance period expires and covid  eviction protections expire, I am worried we might see a surge in  foreclosures and thus a flood of cheap real estate hitting the market, thus drastically reducing home prices in the second half of 2021.

I'll  walk you through the timing I am seeing. 

* The majority of forbearance  requests were made in March - June (the MBA has been publishing this  data). 
* These periods usually last 180 days,  based on historical forbearance periods. 
* And I believe these periods can  be extended for up to one year, which is also part of covid relief.
* The  national average number of delinquent payments on a mortgage before  foreclosure is about four.
* For those with 180 day forbearance periods started in March- June of 2020, it looks like this: 6 months forbearance + 4 months delinquency = 10 months, which puts these foreclosures on the market in February 2021-May 2021.
* For those with 365 day forbearance periods started in March- June of 2020, it looks like this: 12 months forbearance + 4 months delinquency = 16 months, which puts these foreclosures on the market in July 2021- October 2021.
* Finally, for those who were delinquent prior to covid, and would have been evicted during covid, the eviction protection has prevented banks from foreclosing, so these homes will hit the market in February 2021, after the eviction protections expire on January 31st 2021. Foreclosures are down 80% this year because of this.

&#x200B;

If  we check FRED and look at delinquent payment on real estate over the  last 20 years, we can see about 10% of homes and real estate were in delinquency by 2010 (below). If all the current forbearances turn into  delinquent payments, which turn into foreclosures, we could see a 2-6%  spike by the end of the summer, or a 2-6x increase in foreclosure  based real estate hitting the market. Plus we need to add in the 80% of foreclosures that will hit post eviction moratorium. That would be about 2/3s the delinquency rate we saw post financial crisis, which would could cause quite a dip in home prices.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5rr035o96t861.png?width=1173&format=png&auto=webp&s=6755ae28f0d241fba65b886498bf1372869637ff

The current market is also further magnified buy the shortage of homes for sale, in part due to the lack of foreclosures due to the eviction moratorium. You can see below, the US is at an all time low for monthly supply  of houses, dating back to 1960.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4136uv3c6t861.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=859c31a721b63b5c01f787d6cfec5ae387a8700e

When you combine a low supply with a relatively high demand (see housing  sales the last two years, below), this creates a pretty expensive market based  on supply and demand. Also, interest rates are low, so people can afford more, so housing prices are higher as a result.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/abfzz0he6t861.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd698a8aefca84c6318c3c74da02ec2293b7aa19

In agreement with this, home prices are the highest in history as well  (below), even when adjusted for inflation (first figure of the post).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nhdsp7bh6t861.png?width=1176&format=png&auto=webp&s=22507cab200c103a0162fb32340bb8c683dd81ca

&#x200B;

This could easily turn  into a serious situation in which a sudden spike in foreclosures and  cheap real estate could cascade into a pretty swift crash, and  significantly reduce the value of real estate around the country by a  huge margin.

Does  anyone here have any real expertise on this matter? I am a complete  newb and idiot. I don't know what I am doing, I am just speculating. I  would greatly appreciate an expert's opinion on the matter.

Look over the list of stocks that have more than tripled in 2020 and GameStop has to jump out at you. GameStop? Really. The small-box video game retailer is one of this year's biggest winners despite wrapping up what will be its third consecutive fiscal year of declining sales. We're not buying physical games these days, and that's bad news for a model that relies on folks trading in their used games and gear for in-store credit.

We're kicking off a new console cycle, but hardware is always the lowest-margin business here. Once you score your PS5 you're not going to come back to GameStop for games the way you did in the past. GameStop used to be a cash-generating machine, but it's been three years since it turned an annual profit. The once beefy dividend was nixed two years ago.

A short squeeze has propped the stock higher, and the market's underestimating what a new console cycle will mean for GameStop. This game was over before it even started, and GameStop -- like DoorDash and SeaWorld -- will be a silent wealth killer in 2021.

GME Reality and Fantasy Prediction,0.94,"  GME is going to have a BIG week.
Here is why:

- RC plays like a chess grandmaster 
- 2 large buys on 12/30 (one intraday and one AH)
- 1st buy came just before RC’s tweets (mocking bears and warning that they are figuratively about to be burned alive in a house fire)
- Both large buys came in around the lows of the day
- QTR 4 in March will be a blowout
- Conference on Jan 11
- Probable release of holiday sales figures before conference
- Ridiculous % of shares sold short
- Hype on this stock is ratcheting up
- $600 stim checks are already in many of our accounts

How much more pain can the short sellers take? 

My crazy prediction/fantasy:

I think we go up 5% by 10 AM Monday,  Jan 4th. 

If a 13d comes out, we are looking at an immediate jump to $28 per share. From there, we go into a 3 day squeeze that will take us past $30 on day 1 (probably Tuesday Jan 5th by noon). On day 2 GME flys by $40, $50, $60, and momentarily hits $140 pps until it settles down around $80 pps by close on Day 3, which would be Thursday Jan 7th.

"1 Year, 100% ROI Challenge! January Thread + First Trade.",0.92,"**Update (1/8/21):**

I took a very big risk trading QS, and have been getting hammered hard by it recently. However, things are not as bad as they appear, when you consider the insane amount of premium I am collecting...

My true cost basis is $65 - $5.50 premium = $59.5 / share. After selling a single weekly covered call, that cost basis will drop to around $54 / share. Each additional weekly CC will continue to drop the cost basis over time. Which means **even with the stock I own being down 20% from my entry, I would still end up with a profit.** That is the power of selling extremely high IV options.

Only if QS tanks well below $50, and stays there for months on end, do I risk an actual loss on this trade. I just hope that doesn't happen...

**Update (1/17/21):**

Well, I really picked a dogshit stock, and now I'm stuck bagholding 100 shares of it...

QS has tanked hard consistently and is now down a whopping 21% from my entry point. Still, I'm going to follow my general rule and not close this position for a loss. I need to find the breakeven covered call. Which means: the intersection point where premium gained from the CC reduces my cost basis to match the strike price of the same CC. At the moment that appears to be almost exactly ATM.

**Option: QS 54c 1/29 = $5.50 premium**

**Cost basis: $65 (assignment) - $5.50 (CSP premium) - $5.50 (CC premium) = $54**

Again, this is the power of Theta Gang on high IV stocks, and why it will always outperform ""buy and hold."" Even with the stock being down 20%, I can still break even at the current price, and all I will have lost is time. Anyone who simply bought shares at the same exact time I entered my CSP would now be down 20% with little hope of recovery. I will of course have to reevaluate the prices Tuesday morning.

**LESSON LEARNED:** Don't be greedy. I was too enticed by the extremely high premium on QS. If I would have continued the more conservative PLTR play from last week, I'd be sitting pretty right now. Hopefully I can still recover and get this challenge back on track next week.

Positions and ROI to be updated Tuesday morning.

**Update (1/20/21):**

Another horrible -7% day for the QS shares we are bagholding. This stone looks like it will never stop dropping. I need to earn premium more quickly to reduce this cost basis as fast as possible. I went with a 30DTE option for $630 to drop my cost basis down to $51.50 per share. Luckily the IV is still sky high, making these significant cost basis reductions possible. However, if this continues tanking through the end of the month, we may just be done for...

=========================================

**Current Positions: 100 QS @ $65.00 (true cost basis: 65 - 5.5 - 1.7 - 6.3 = $51.50)**

**-1 QS 52c 2/5 @ 6.30**

Some of the less experienced among you may think this is a simple feat. The more experienced among you will know achieving such consistently high returns will be an incredibly difficult feat. I put my odds of success somewhere around 20% to be honest. But it will be a good education for both of us. Really, I only need to achieve around 6% return every month to break 100% by the end of the year (after compounding), and put in those terms the task doesn't sound so daunting, does it?

Still, I will be forced to make some very aggressive, downright risky plays in order to make this remotely possible. If my wheeling ETF guide was about a safe, conservative strategy, this guide will be the opposite. Keep that in mind if you are foolish enough to copy my trades.

Wish me luck... I will need it.

# Basic Strategy

I will not leave any tool off the table here. If I see an opportunity, I will take it. But for the majority of my trades I will be using a very simple strategy. Find high implied volatility stonks and sell options on them. I will typically be selling cash-secured puts since naked calls carry excess risk, which means I want to look for stocks I am generally bullish on long-term.

Using ToS I've set up some very basic filters to scan for promising stocks to trade:

**1) Option Implied Volatility >80% (for tendies)**

**2) Stock Volume >5,000,000 (for liquidity)**

**3) Market Cap >$1B (to comply with WSB rules)**

**4) Stock Price <$82 (collateral maximum)**

Scanning with these filters brings up a lot of familiar names: GME, PLTR, QS, NKLA, LAZR, FCEL, UVXY, ACB, XPEV, SPCE, and so on. In other words, the type of stonks retards like you are buying expensive options on...

# Running the Numbers

I will try to not get too technical and into the weeds with this experiment. I'll be using some very basic math to decide which options to sell. I highly recommend you play around with the numbers on options to really get an intuitive feel for how they work. For example, if I were to ask you what happens to the relative cost of premium ($/day) as DTE increases on an option, what would be your answer? If you don't know, just run some simple numbers to find out...

SPY premium / DTE = $/day

332 / 5 = 66.4

440 / 10 = 44

652 / 21 = 31

1915 / 140 = 13.7

As you can see, premium cost per day decreases as time till expiration increases. (It's more complicated than that of course, but we are keeping it simple here). For that reason I will be doing something I generally don't advocate: Selling weeklies to squeeze a bit of extra juice out of my options. This also means I will be holding them all to expiration to deal with issues like higher gamma.

Here is another simple equation I can use to give me a lot of information:

**(Premium \* 365) / (DTE \* Strike) = Max ROI**

Basically what I'm doing is estimating the returns from selling the same option for an entire year with a 100% success rate. Since I'm aiming for 100% ROI, any options I sell will need to be over 100 in this formula. Of course, I won't have a 100% success rate on my trades, so I should probably aim even higher to give myself some buffer, maybe around 120. Let's try it on some \~ATM options to get a relative comparison of option value:

SPY: 12.2

PSTH: 48.1

GME: 140.5

PLTR: 111.1

QS: 263.7

UVXY: 134.2

Don't put too much stock in these numbers. I'm just using them as a simple comparative tool for judging the profitability of different options.

We can glean even more information from the above number if we multiply it by the Prob. ITM% of course, to get something closer to an ""Expected Value"" for an option, which I will perhaps go into more detail on next month.

Finally I'll be throwing around various other calculations as I go, $/day, ROI/month, premium/collateral, and so on. I will need to watch all of these and more to reach my goal.

# My First Trade

Looking at the stocks in my filter, there are two that really stand out to me: GME and PLTR. That's right, everyones favorite meme stocks!

GameStop is interesting as a short-term play, and has very high IV. But I'm not confident in the company as a long-term play, and would hate to be assigned hundreds of shares of that shitty brick and mortar hellscape. Palantir, on the other hand, has serious growth potential long-term and I would not mind being assigned. It has also been hit hard recently and is at a more reasonable entry level, which also makes it a good choice. **Therefore, I will be trading PLTR as my first play.**

I want to sell an OTM put to give myself some downside protection against a further drop, but not so far OTM that I can't break my 100% ROI goal. Let's plug some of the Jan. 15 options into my formula above to get a breakdown of the potential ROI.

21 strike: 74.2

22 strike: 108.4

22.5 strike: 131.9

23 strike: 155.5

Either the 22 or 22.5 strikes are right near the sweet spot we are looking for in terms of return. Of course conditions will likely change on Monday and I may need to reassess, but at the moment my current play seems to be:

**Sell to Open 3 contracts of PLTR 22p 1/15.**

If Monday opens red it will be even better for us, since we get in at a cheaper price with likely higher IV on top. So I for one am praying for a bloody Monday for Palantir (sorry bagholders).

Of course after selling 3 contracts at 22 strike, we will only have used $6600 of our $8000 capital. I may need to look for one more smallish trade on a stock in the $14 range to take full advantage of our capital. If GME drops on Monday we could consider a far OTM play there, for instance.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR- I am going to double a small account, and you are going to watch.**

I will update this post as plays are made, and will create a new post each month as a recap. As always questions are welcome.",2021-01-01 16:39:33

I added up all the individual awards and the costs as of the time starting there was 4990 awards. 

Turns out a total of 2,411,187 coins had been spent on awards, this equates to $7670.49 at the standard reddit price of €214.99 for 82000 coins. (converted to dollars using current rate) 

This could have been 407.1 shares of GME or 325.7 shares of Pltr at current prices.

Just unbanned for GME DD. Next up TWTR DD for 2021.,0.77,"I am writing this Twitter DD on 12/28/20 while currently banned for posting a rumor that I made up that Gamestop would be delivering vaccines.   

Onto the Twitter DD.  

Point 1: Look at TWTR just by the numbers. The market cap is $43B as compared to Snap at $73B. Twitter has 330 million monthly active users and 187 million daily actives. Snap has something like 101 million daily active users. Snap has 1.72B in revenue in 2019. Twitter had 3.5B in revenue in 2019. The maths dont add up.   

More recently, Q3 2020 was $775M for Twitter and $679M, Q3 2020.  Snap is growing faster so the higher multiple may be justified from that perspective. But what if Twitter came up with a new revenue stream? If you are still reading, might as well read a little more. It's not like I am going to start a rumor that Gamestop is going to deliver the coronavirus vaccine despite this map showing how easily half the United States could both get coronavirus-free and a new PS5 while waiting https://bit.ly/2WSQvq8. I digress...

Point 2: Twitter announced in July that they are going to work on a paid version ala OnlyFans (https://cnn.it/34L1VRl). If they actually introduce that this year, this should be a similar moment to Disney killing it on digital subscribers (which I made 1000% and $100k on https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jqytzu/mickey_mouse_mega_gains_mickey_mousa_usa_usa_1500/) or Facebook adding local stores or whatever they did this year. The question is WHEN will Twitter introduce it. If you are hiring in July would you beta something 6 months out? 9 months out? 12 months? That's for your call options to decide.   

Point 3: Twitter has the worst career pages of all tech companies. But if you are willing to suffer through the shitty animations, the worst search you have ever used, and forced diversity showcasing imagery, then you might notice that recent Engineering posts like the one in this screenshot https://imgur.com/a/D85SNsM (post here: https://bit.ly/37QZnD3) hold a curious couple lines around payments. Specifically:  ""We’re on a mission to build the foundation of a strong payment platform to enable a multi-fold growth of Twitter’s revenue."" and ""Enable payments functionality for advertisers, and in ****not-so-distant future****, for other Twitter revenue streams.""   
   
Now again, it's up to you to decide what ""not-so-distant"" means. To me, that means 1-2 quarters maximum. To a shitty company, that could mean 1-2 years or it might never happen. My opinion is that now that Jack Dorsey announced that Twitter employees can ""work from home forever"" they might actually be motivated to build some shit that makes more money. To prove that this may actually be the case, check out Glassdoor reviews. You will notice that those from engineers have become more positive with 5 star reviews https://bit.ly/2X44h9P.   
   
tl;dr Twitter might be your chance to invest in something like OnlyFans before OnlyFans IPOs or gets acquired by a SPAC or whatever

Why Salesforce ($CRM) is going to be the next SAP,0.56,"I got two goals here. One is for you to understand what Salesforce and SAP really do instead of just ""cloud"" and ""software"" and why Salesforce will become like SAP. The second is to tell you what to expect with CRM price and how to make tendies.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First you gotta understand what exactly SAP does and what happened with their stock. SAP is one of the largest software companies which focus on ERP. What the fuck is ERP you might ask? ERP is what other businesses use to track business resources. This ranges from everything such as planning and optimizing manufacturing capacity to dealing with payroll for employees. Basically companies don't want to create their own software for handling these wide range of tasks and pay SAP a shit load of money to do it for them. Where's the problem you might ask? Unless you are involved with one of these companies that use SAP, it's difficult to understand what the experience is like.

&#x200B;

[https://preview.redd.it/htsfvr8uro861.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=db3b665c95ce5d62639a4dc0e5d9469a08510cbd](https://preview.redd.it/htsfvr8uro861.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=db3b665c95ce5d62639a4dc0e5d9469a08510cbd)

Basically a company pays SAP to use their software for dealing with one of these areas of ERP. This generally works fine since SAP has used their business management software with a lot of companies for the same tasks. The issue is when one of these companies want to [customize the software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning#Disadvantages) to meet unique demands for the company. This re-engineering process to fit the ERP system for many tasks ends up costing more for a company and wasting a lot of time and money. Interestingly enough, you can ask almost any business about their experience with SAP and they will all say that they're unhappy even though they use their software. So what you might ask, wouldn't SAP still be generating tons of revenue? Well yes but more of these companies are moving away from this way of doing ERP as it is an inflexible approach. This is becoming replaced by more loosely connected systems utilizing cloud instead of having a one solves all solution.

&#x200B;

[https://preview.redd.it/ugj07ez0to861.png?width=984&format=png&auto=webp&s=c45c19bcdd0e10bd643286730aa3a2beeec0ae20](https://preview.redd.it/ugj07ez0to861.png?width=984&format=png&auto=webp&s=c45c19bcdd0e10bd643286730aa3a2beeec0ae20)

Let's look at how their financial earnings and stock price have reflected this. In the past two years this stock has traded relatively sideways with some really bad drops. Around May to August their stock price went up 60% do to the hype around cloud companies benefiting from COVID. However it has obviously taken a really bad fall when October earnings were announced. They claimed that there was slower recovery than anticipated for many of its clients. However I suspect that many of these companies have been looking to shift away from SAP as the pandemic has shown the importance of the flexibility of these systems. By looking at their past quarters, you can see that their quarterly revenue has been flat around the 8 billion range and the company is clearly having a difficult time changing their business model. Other cloud companies are replacing their solutions as SAP's clients move away from their software even though SAP is trying to shift to [modern cloud technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP#Corporate_restructuring). Generally though companies have a hard time changing their business approach from the old way of doing things to the new way of doing things.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now the important part. What the fuck does SAP's troubles have to do with Salesforce. As you may have guessed from the ticker Salesforce provides CRM or customer relationship management. [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) is a specific area in ERP dealing with customer services. For example a company may want a software for their call center or to automate a marketing effort. Salesforce provides software to do this along with analytics of this data so that these businesses can make informed decisions.

As you may have already guessed Salesforce is facing some similar problems that SAP deal with. When a company decides to expand their CRM software to deal with more parts of their business, the inflexibility and costs quickly become apparent. [For example, many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial basis and less than 40 percent of companies have high end-user adoption rates.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management#Criticism) Again if you are not familiar with software development and companies using these software vendors it is difficult to fully understand these troubles. I would strongly recommend researching the issues of customizing ERP or CRM software for a specific company if you are not convinced. While Salesforce tries to provide an all in one solution for their clients, customization becomes complicated and prices become costly. These customizations become difficult to do and take a lot of time, planning, and money. Companies are becoming more inclined to take a different approach for building these systems. In a lot of these cases it is easier for a business to build their own system in the cloud using products from companies such as Microsoft or Amazon for more customizability.

Another big issue is the concern over customer data with CRM systems. A company might opt to develop their own CRM systems where they can ensure that customer data is obeying customer privacy laws and allows them to have more control over private data. This can help build a better relationship with the customer. Privacy issues over customer data has obviously become a big issue in 2020.

Furthermore, Salesforce has been trying to get into more areas with [recent acquisitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce). Similar to SAP, I suspect that Salesforce will crush over their own weight as they try to expand their company. One good example of this is their recent acquisition of Slack. Slack does not really fit any of Salesforce ecosystem and is really just an attempt to expand into a different area. Slack has a lot of competition from Microsoft teams and other companies which can do what Slack does but better.

Business will start to move away from Salesforce similar to SAP. This is not to say that they be completely independent as Salesforce does make some parts of the businesses easier. However there seems to be a strong resemblance to SAP based on what I know from inside of a corporation using both SAP and Salesforce and the many issues they face when they try and customize their solutions.

Edit: Just take a look a the reviews for salesforce [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/salesforce.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/salesforce.com)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So how can we use this information to print tendies? The expectation is that Salesforce will eventually slow their growth down while stock is overhyped due to being a cloud company and start to fall or go sideways like SAP.

&#x200B;

[https://preview.redd.it/vl629rb14p861.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&s=4282ffef17bd83b9a62a7f196974d0113511b1d5](https://preview.redd.it/vl629rb14p861.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&s=4282ffef17bd83b9a62a7f196974d0113511b1d5)

Basically the idea is to try and play puts, especially around earnings. If Salesforce misses their guidance then the stock could be in a serious reversal especially for a cloud company with a lot of hype. The next earnings will be late February/early March.

You can also try and play longer term puts but the stock is fairly volatile like SAP and I would only do this if you see the price go up significantly.

&#x200B;

tldr; buy puts for late February/early March

GME with Greeks for the Geeks,0.9,"ETHOS: I've been scalping stocks for four years. From the start, I've planned on making a living from it. YTD I've finished 2020 at 230%. (Only played tesla once and lost on it.) This is my career path and my rent, car, bills, wife, and step child all depend on it.

PATHOS: fuck banks. Fuck them fuck them fuck them fuck them. Anybody who's tried to swim in the market knows that big money controls money. WSB has caught two such banks with their shorts down. Melvin and BOA have their shorts around their ankles on GME.

Why you need to take mortgage forbearance ASAP,0.72,"If you currently have a federally backed mortgage you will be absolutely fucking retarded if you don't take mortgage forbearance!

due to the cares act pasting earlier in 2020 you are able to take forbearance and not have to pay back the missed payments until the end of your loan. 

Think about it, you basically get an interest free loan for 30 God damn years.

Example: My mortgage is $1300 now even if you were a boring ass boomer excited about your 7% annual returns after 30 years you would accumulate $118,751 after the 30 years.

Now if you want to showcase how massive your giant bull balls are you can put that money in PLTR, GME, or TSLA and see real fucking gains.

Edit: I think it's funny that a lot of the dislikes comes from people thinking this is some scumbag leach off the system shit meanwhile there are billionaires who gained billions through this pandemic, corporations taking PPE loans that don't need them, people finding creative tax loopholes all the time.

🚀🚀🚀JUICY GME DD 🚀🚀🚀 + Reason behind ICR change,0.93,"Alright earlier today I wrote an Erotica novel of DD, which was mainly a preface / foreplay to this. The idea was to be able to finish it all in one go, but I ran out of my supply...

All jokes aside, life came up and I thought I could finish it rather soon but that didn’t happen. 

Many of you have an attention span that is not longer than you could last in bed, so I’ll just spill the DD here. I highly encourage you to go back to [that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/knxf4f/gme_dd_pt2_coordinated_charity_for_autism_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)  because I’m trying to coordinate and a make a push for charities, donation ideas, and creating a social media push / trend to not only round up undiagnosed Autists out there, but to also to send batman signals to #TheDogFather Ryan Cohen.


The best “news” can be slaughtered by poor presentation. I have doubts with Sherman up there, perhaps they’ll use someone effective. 🤷🏻‍♂️

#DD points: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

1) GME is making a bigger push to becoming PC oriented, not just games and accessories, but parts as well. 

2) The reason Sherman was able to qualify GME as “essential business” was because of the few PC stuff they had. Then they sold out of that PC stuff in March and after that they were basically open because of PC qualification despite not having any PC items. By switching to “technology” category, Sherman would have to qualify them into that. The way he has been able to do so is for 2 reasons. 

A) To ensure that they’ll stay open in similar lockdowns. This will probably not be mentioned...but the dude did push for his stores to remain open and got backlash for it. Already tarnished a damaged image. 

B) Change business model and get in that Tech Train.


3) OmniChannel experience. 

4) GME has signed contracts with “about 6” vendors and providers “a couple which were just recently.” That number was a ball park # off the top of their mind. These include MSI, NewEgg and so on. 

5) You will be able to outright buy gaming PCs in stores and / or just order any part you may need. They’ve ran small trials for these and plan on rolling it out to stores at different times. Unfortunately not every store will have the same experience/ products based on demographic/ size...but they should still be able to order and ship to home or store pick up. 

6) Stores will have dedicated areas for PC experience. Ok let’s be realistic, most stores are the size a studio...so the PC area will be a house for ants. 

But if you check out local GME stores and see empty display areas / locked glass with nothing in it, this is where it is probably going to be dedicated. 

7) Even if you buy $10 card with $5 certificate, you’re not hurting GME. All those cards have been paid for before they got on the wall. You’re helping money come back, plus the goal is that people will spend more money. 

The goal from my 1st post with push of pro memberships wasn’t to rely on the $15 or $20...and have that as the savior. 

The idea is that with more memberships, you have more leads, and you have people who are more likely to buy products from you. You’ve now successfully pried someone from going a bigger retailer or online merchant. 

8) Buy memberships for other people. You can also buy memberships for business such as daycare / hospitals etc. At the very least they can have a physical magazine delivered on a monthly basis ($20 version) even if they never choose to use certificates. 

9) Pro Rewards:
#digital gamers benefit hugely. 
Remember those PSN / Steam etc cards, there is 40pts for every dollar spent on those as opposed to 20 pts on everything else.

Why does this matter? Faster points to redeem certificates for yourself or charities already affiliated with GME. 

Every 5k can be redeemed for $5 certificate or donated to charities. 

If you just recently signed up, you got 10K points already, plus welcome $5 coupon. Your 1st official $5 certificate will be available 1st of each month... so you may have up $20 available pretty soon...

10) GME now offers their own CC, which is available to use the same day. They also offer flex pay options from 3 different vendors who allow you to qualify from your phone and make payments ...GME isn’t taking this risk, they get paid from the vendors, customer pays the vendor. 

They also have a rent to own program, with minimum of $120+. 

Final points:

Most customers are buying for other people, that isn’t going to change. So while e-commerce is huge, some Karens will always need to show up to store...

But GME sells “used games” for nearly same price as new or more expensive than new games. They don’t make this decision, they sign contracts that can’t reduce price on these games until x amount of time...

But GME barely offers any $$$ for my product.

Hi there, they are a business, the most important thing for a business after customer service is to have profit margins.

##How long 1 minute is depends on which side of the bathroom door you’re on...

Let’s talk a quick lesson of value vs worth.

Your PSP might be worth $100 to you, but it only has a a value of $5 to GME. Why? Because for every 1 person that comes in looking for a PSP, they have 15 others trying to trade in. After they reach their limit of trade in, wtf are they going to do? Collect every PSP at the price you want them to? So that’s part of why you get offered low prices.

There’s other things involved. They have bills to pay, electricity, rent, wages, medical benefits, legal fees, alarm / security, maintenance on commercial grade AC/ventilation and many more. Oh yea, they also provide people with a safe place to trade in without risking getting robbed, shot, or killed. 

When any business closes, it’s not just those employees who lose their job. The services that that business relies on (mentioned above) now lose a customer and revenue as well. There is less stores for that AC company to send people out to...which means less money for them, which leads to more lost jobs. 

And you know what caused it? That lazy bum who chose the comfort of purchasing from home from an online merchant etc. There’s much more to this and this is just the tip of the iceberg when people choose how you do business and shop. There’s pros and cons to everything. I’m not saying never order online, but try to keep a balance. Support your local businesses when you can. 


#TL;DR:

GME Weird Options Price Action,0.79,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tpg1pco3gm861.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e83f79e9aac4792813306222d5d683f915f2b90

Ok so this is bugging me the fuck out. basically this is the 1/15 GME OTM calls for today and on the 2nd to the last column is the % change for the day. now GME swung up and down \~2% throughout the day ending the day with a big dump. 

I watched the price action on my OTM calls all day and noticed that prices did change violently as the stock swung violently. But towards the end of the day when the stock dumped, options price did not change at all. If fact it went up a little.

From my understanding, any far OTM FDs get wrecked if the stock price goes down just a little bit. but this time it went up??? I'm just wondering what could have caused call options starting from 27 all the way to 40 caused the price to go up. I understand it could be like a liquidity issue but then who's buying all these options??? Could it be the institution?? I'm hella confused. If you have any idea please comment below.",2021-01-01 01:30:43

But look at the fucking game right now. What color jerseys are the Rockets wearing? Exactly. Blue, the same color as the Dallas Mavericks, and the Houston Oilers (who had red, white, and blue color schemes)

To make things more interesting, the sons of the guy who founded ""Babbages,"" which eventually became gamestop, got a deal on Shark Tank with non other than Mark Cuban, the owner of the Mavericks himself.

Now if we take the R in ""Rockets"" and C in ""Cuban"", we get RC: Ryan Cohen.

Selling Leaps - Vega Plays,0.81,"For those who don't know their Greeks yet, go read the Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks\_(finance)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_(finance))) and then donate $2.75 of your 2020 gains to them so you get the tax write-off. Probably will cross post this with r/thetagang this weekend, but they tend to get uppity about Vega plays.

2020 had historically high volatility, but we have already started to see that volatility steadily drop over the course of the year. My thesis is this will continue to drop significantly throughout Q1/Q2 of next year and then level off once ""normal"" business operations resume sometime in the 2nd half of 2021.

Most people are familiar with Theta plays involving selling an option and running out the clock. In a nutshell, Vega measures how the value of an option will respond to changes in volatility (IV). If you are buying piles of PSTH, GME, PLTR, shares (etc.), you might consider selling a covered call far into the future with intentions of buying it back in 3-6 months. Yes, the stocks are going to go up eventually, but probably not as fast as Theta and Vega will drag them down over the next several months. Also, you should time selling it for a spike and buying back a few months later on a dip.

I have been doing this with mostly SPACs with mid-dated calls (3-6 months out), but also a handful of stocks like PLTR, DISCA, and some small caps I can't name for Leaps. My costs basis on the shares have been pushed down significantly and now all of my SPACs shares are significantly below NAV (below $20 for PSTH and below $10 for the others). I haven't always timed things perfectly, but overall this has been an effective strategy the past 3 months.

**Edit:  wouldn't recommend doing this with small/microcaps if volume for leaps is low.**

***Alternatively***, poor man's covered calls (PMCC) are quite viable, but be careful doing that on Robinhood because if your short leg gets called they will automatically call your long leg to cover it and you'll lose a bit of money. This runs counter to my thesis in the mid-run but for many stocks in the long run it's a good play as well.",2020-12-31 23:57:53

Super Serial Reasoning Why GME And PLTR Will Moon in 2021,0.89,"While you simps have been going flaccid staring at your PLTR positions going into the shitter on the daily chart, your boy, uncovered some super-secret ancient Chinese knowledge on why 2021 will be the year that will bring our GME and PLTR positions to the moon and then some. 

You see, unlike over here in the west, the Chinese people don't treat 2021 as some new number they slap on a calendar, oh no. 2021 also represents a new animal on their zodiac calendar. And what animal is 2021? The year of the FUCKING BULL. That's right boys, the bull market is confirmed!

Just as reminder, most of you should have possibly received your first “welcome” $5 certificate from GME. Your first month’s Certificates will be available at the beginning of calendar month. You also received 10k points to be redeemed for 2x$5 off coupons or donate $10 to a charity. So by tomorrow you should have $10-$20 incentive to make it rain at GME. (You can end up with min $75 in certificates in the 12 month period)

GME didn’t take me seriously. I contacted HQ, the HR department specifically. I said I would like to get on board with GME and that I’m responsible for a massive spike in their memberships. The guy was dumbfounded of my request to look into Pro Membership numbers and said he would “email others to look into it and they may contact” me...then he suggested that I should still apply for positions at GME....when I said I want to be on board, I literally meant the board....but I’ll be willing to start off as a district manager or in marketing.

#Official Start of the Post

WSB is what GME is to the general public. Just like GME, most people don’t understand WSB and have a negative view on us. They hear rumors, see glimpses and glorified headlines and make their opinion on WSB. 

Are we perfect? Hell no. Are we saints? Absolutely not. Do we have some bad apples who are cringeworthy that even we at WSB despise? Absolutely! WSB isn’t for soft ❄️ and the faint of heart individuals who take things at face value. 

The truth is, just like GME, there is a lot of positives to us, but not everyone notices that and looks at both GME and WSB as pure evil. **Many are betting against GME and WSB.** Unfortunately for them, both are here to stay, and will become a greater presence as time goes on. 


Have you ever beat it up so good that months later  they contacted you back for a repeat? Well you haven’t, but your wife can attest to this experience.

**“The axe forgets what the tree remembers.”**

We are going to hit Mel and other shorts twice. 

Before I lose you since this will be a lengthy post with lofty goals of charity and coordinated social media presence...

GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕📈📈📈📈📈📈📈


This is an attempt to coordinate our efforts and become a more powerful force to be reckoned with. 

##Speaking of Force, even Physics validates GME🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀

You see there is an equation for Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation. The law is that objects with greater masses have a greater (attraction) gravitational force. The attractive force is directly related to the mass of the objects, and inversely related to the distance between them. 

The more massive the objects, the greater the force. The greater the distance, the less of the force. Want proof? Have you ever seen any chicks on my 600 lb life who is single? They all have a partner. Have you seen the 1000 lb sisters? One of them is currently pregnant. That means that someone, possibly one of you, managed to get her pregnant. 

The law validates itself, the more massive you are, the more attractive you become. GME has been a massive target for shorts, it has been and will remain a huge attraction to shorts and bears. 

GME is so attractive, that Mel left GME for dead. They could’ve closed positions, they weren’t satisfied at $4. They want GME bankrupt. 

Don Ciccio was wise enough to order Vito to be killed when he was 9, but his foot soldiers weren’t the best. In fact, when Vito’s mom begged Don Ciccio to spare Vito who is ”dumb-witted and only 9 years old” after having killed her husband and her oldest son who has vowed revenge; Don Ciccio responded “when he becomes bigger, he will come for revenge and kill me.” 

So calling Mel Don Ciccio is an insult because Don Ciccio was wise to attempt to tie up loose ends, but the fate is the same. 

Back to Physics: The law and equation...

The equation (for Earth) is:

#F = GMeM / Re^^2

##Can you believe this???

We all know what Re means...but if they are scattered and too far from each other, the force is not as great. This is why we have to recruit and bring all the scattered individuals to join the cause. The closer the distance of Re, the greater the force. 



With that said, not all forces are evil, and we will be benefiting many great causes. 

We are the leading sub in gifting awards, by a landslide, and that’s not even coordinated. Imagine if we did actually start to coordinate for our goals. 

FFS, **we may have set the record of most awards given to a post** for a post that said to buy shares instead of awards. 

People are aware of us....but they don’t take us seriously. They notice us, they lurk for their headlines and etc, but they don’t see the true power behind us. Every now and then, they may acknowledge or refer to us, but the reality is, it is always in a negative way. In fact, that’s ok. We don’t want to give the illusion that we do charities and donations to improve our “image.” We are not like the powerful and famous people who do things for PR purposes. We are just your regular individuals who have a more giving heart then the people who look down upon us. 

Many people here have individually donated to charities and towards great causes, for genuine reasons, and that is far more valuable than those who donate for pure PR. 

##Back to the tree and axe saying:

The tree is Mel, old, ancient, and deeply rooted in their beliefs. While trees are beneficial, this one is rotten and is experiencing heart rot. On top of this, there are many termites planning on feasting (smaller position shorts and bears.) We are not going to eradicate them, we are going to hit them twice. They’ll call the first one a fluke, contribute it to new console releases, and pure luck of WSB. 

But at some point, in order to realize gains, we will have to sell. Eventually time will pass, GME will be lower than its peak values because of the inevitable squeeze, and some unfortunate souls will be FOMOing at the top and be left bag holding. These bags will be so big and heavy that not even Southwest Airlines will let them fly for free. 

The likes of Mel, boomer analysts, and bears will rise again and claim that it is going back to the “5 year trend.” They’ll be setting themselves up for a 2nd round...But by this time

##TheDogFather Cohen has taken over GME 

and laid the foundations of successful business that will help GME transition and thrive. 


GME has consolidated and we’ve kept it above $19.
But no one is taking us seriously. There was an obvious attack that made the Uptick Rule go into effect this week, and many expected today to be the dip. We here at WSB don’t have  🧻 TP hands, but there are others who do. Those individuals are not aware of us and are easily manipulated. We should educate them, harden them up and have them join the cause.

Just like how many of you and the public weren’t aware of the memberships, many people (outside of here) aren’t aware of the strategy. Or if they are, they may not understand what to do and what not to do...ie during uptick rule times and not using margins etc. 

We also want to quickly spread solid info. Some of you posted my post on stock twits and noticed other people talking about it. Thank you for that, we made a reach, but we need to make it bigger. 

This is where my new info and DD will come into play, and many others as well. 

The reality is, many people (consumers and “investors” are still having the stereotypical view of GME. These stereotypes are leading to a downfall and an uphill battle. 

Getting the word out and educating people is the best thing to do, not just for GME, but for all businesses. There is great lesson to learn from and there’s more to it than just “they didn’t transition with the times”

There are valuable lessons to learn from BlockBuster and TRU, which I will get to. 


#You can redeem 5k points for an additional $5 certificate or donate to the current charities GME is affiliated with. 

We can also come up with our indirect donation / charity. One of my ideas was is that we can organize a program with hospitals. 

We can buy memberships under fake names or possibly 

#Ryan Chewy

The Ryan Chewy name will serve a 2 fold purpose. Besides in the name of TheDogFather, it’ll serve as a warning signal to Sherman as what is to come and that he better not start taking credit for more “memberships and retention.”

And use the phone number of a local children’s hospital. This bit of info can be shared with that hospital, and they can use the certificates to purchase little toys etc. Obviously the hospital would need to use their own funds to cover the remaining balance, but perhaps they already have such budget, or maybe they can set up and we can donate here and there. 

At the very least, they can get a physical copy of the magazine (assuming you signed up for $20)...but since it’s COVID, the magazine can’t really be shared...so maybe digital is better.

These are just random ideas, if we combine all of our low IQs, we can come up with some good benefit drive ideas etc.

#New Update


Alright earlier today I wrote an Erotica novel of DD, which was mainly a preface / foreplay to this. The idea was to be able to finish it all in one go, but I ran out of my supply...

All jokes aside, life came up and I thought I could finish it rather soon but that didn’t happen. 

Many of you have an attention span that is longer than you could last in bed, so I’ll just spill the DD here. I highly encourage you to go back to that post because I’m trying to coordinate and a make a push for charities, donation ideas, and creating a social media push / trend to not only round up undiagnosed Autists out there, but to also to send batman signals to #TheDogFather Ryan Cohen.


The best “news” can be slaughtered by poor presentation. I have doubts with Sherman up there, perhaps they’ll use someone effective. 🤷🏻‍♂️

#DD points: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

1) GME is making a bigger push to becoming PC oriented, not just games and accessories, but parts as well. 

2) The reason Sherman was able to qualify GME as “essential business” was because of the few PC stuff they had. Then they sold out of that PC stuff in March and after that they were basically open because of PC qualification despite not having any PC items. By switching to “technology” category, Sherman would have to qualify them into that. The way he has been able to do so is for 2 reasons. 

A) To ensure that they’ll stay open in similar lockdowns. This will probably not be mentioned...but the dude did push for his stores to remain open and got backlash for it. Already tarnished a damaged image. 

B) Change business model and get in that Tech Train.


3) OmniChannel experience. 

4) GME has signed contracts with “about 6” vendors and providers “a couple which were just recently.” That number was a ball park # off the top of their mind. These include MSI, NewEgg and so on. 

5) You will be able to outright buy gaming PCs in stores and / or just order any part you may need. They’ve ran small trials for these and plan on rolling it out to stores at different times. Unfortunately not every store will have the same experience/ products based on demographic/ size...but they should still be able to order and ship to home or store pick up. 

6) Stores will have dedicated areas for PC experience. Ok let’s be realistic, most stores are the size a studio...so the PC area will be a house for ants. 

But if you check out local GME stores and see empty display areas / locked glass with nothing in it, this is where it is probably going to be dedicated. 

7) Even if you buy $10 card with $5 certificate, you’re not hurting GME. All those cards have been paid for before they got on the wall. You’re helping money come back, plus the goal is that people will spend more money. 

The goal from my 1st post with push of pro memberships wasn’t to rely on the $15 or $20...and have that as the savior. 

The idea is that with more memberships, you have more leads, and you have people who are more likely to buy products from you. You’ve now successfully pried someone from going a bigger retailer or online merchant. 

8) Buy memberships for other people. You can also buy memberships for business such as daycare / hospitals etc. At the very least they can have a physical magazine delivered on a monthly basis ($20 version) even if they never choose to use certificates. 

9) Pro Rewards:
#digital gamers benefit hugely. 
Remember those PSN / Steam etc cards, there is 40pts for every dollar spent on those as opposed to 20 pts on everything else.

Why does this matter? Faster points to redeem certificates for yourself or charities already affiliated with GME. 

Every 5k can be redeemed for $5 certificate or donated to charities. 

If you just recently signed up, you got 10K points already, plus welcome $5 coupon. Your 1st official $5 certificate will be available 1st of each month... so you may have up $20 available pretty soon...

10) GME now offers their own CC, which is available to use the same day. They also offer flex pay options from 3 different vendors who allow you to qualify from your phone and make payments ...GME isn’t taking this risk, they get paid from the vendors, customer pays the vendor. 

They also have a rent to own program, with minimum of $120+. 

Final points:

Most customers are buying for other people, that isn’t going to change. So while e-commerce is huge, some Karens will always need to show up to store...

But GME sells “used games” for nearly same price as new or more expensive than new games. They don’t make this decision, they sign contracts that can’t reduce price on these games until x amount of time...

But GME barely offers any $$$ for my product.

Hi there, they are a business, the most important thing for a business after great customer service is to have profit margins. 

##How long 1 minute is depends on which side of the bathroom door you’re on...

Let’s talk a quick lesson of value vs worth.

Your PSP might be worth $100 to you, but it only has a a value of $5 to GME. Why? Because for every 1 person that comes in looking for a PSP, they have 15 others trying to trade in. After they reach their limit of trade in, wtf are they going to do? Collect every PSP at the price you want them to? So that’s part of why you get offered low prices.

There’s other things involved. They have bills to pay, electricity, rent, wages, medical benefits, legal fees, alarm / security, maintenance on commercial grade AC/ventilation and many more. Oh yea, they also provide people with a safe place to trade in without risking getting robbed, shot, or killed. 

When any business closes, it’s not just those employees who lose their job. The services that that business relies on (mentioned above) now lose a customer and revenue as well. There is less stores for that AC company to send people out to...which means less money for them, which leads to more lost jobs. 

And you know what caused it? That lazy bum who chose the comfort of purchasing from home from an online merchant etc. There’s much more to this and this is just the tip of the iceberg when people choose how you do business and shop. There’s pros and cons to everything. I’m not saying never order online, but try to keep a balance. Support your local businesses when you can. 

People complain about not giving their child the same memories of going to TRU, but don’t realize that they themselves led to the downfall. GME was also there for many people who went and played video games at stores for free, as opposed to an arcade. Now people turn their backs on them when they have the opportunity to pay it back, by simply buying the same stuff they are going to anyway from other online / brick &amp; mortar merchants whose gaming department is less than 5% of their piece of pie. 


#TL;DR:

ICR changed to Tech because they are changing their ways, and going more PC oriented. They’ve signed contracts with vendors and providers. More focus to PC gaming, include actual gaming computers, and parts that can be ordered.

Ultimate $GME Takeover 🚀🚀🚀,0.97,,2020-12-31 20:25:45
"GME 2021 timeline predictions, institutional bullshit, and how to spot when the short squeeze will happen.",0.95,"With the year ending It's time to look forward for our GME projections and be realistic about our outlook and expectations for the stock price. If you've seen my other DD, I predicted the post earnings dip and the EOY dip, and I have a pretty good idea of what we will see in january. This is a dumbed down version of:

* how institutions could pull a fast one on us and mitigate a short squeeze
   * and how to spot it
* january-july Price target and timeline
* Graph of what the SS will look like

&#x200B;

One thing is certain: GME shorts will have to unwind their short positions somehow.  While they will be gaped, there are a couple ways they could avoid a squeeze that we should be aware of. These are possible scenarios of how they could do it (and avoid an infinity squeeze up their ass).

* **1) Call hedging:** The GME bankruptcy thesis likely resulted in a shit ton of short shares *without hedging with calls*, however it is becoming increasingly obvious that gamestop will not be going bankrupt.
   * **Be on the lookout for massive volume in calls dated 2 months or less.** While there aren't enough calls in existence to prevent a short squeeze, institutions will try to buy as many calls as possible to avoid paying market prices for the shares they need to cover.
   * ***Massive volume in short dated calls will signal that the squeeze is happening soon.***
      * It is likely that institutions have already started buying up calls to cover their ass. If you have shares, **DO NOT SELL COVERED CALLS FROM THEM.** by doing this you make the likelihood of a squeeze decrease.
* **2) A deal**: Hedge funds, banks, etc may try to unwind their short position with some behind closed doors deal. A scenario like this could include: Melvin offering shares of other stocks at discounted prices in exchange for GME shares or to unload a portion of their short shares. The second party to this deal could also offer to buy GME shares for higher than market prices ($35,40,60 etc).
   * Personally I think this is unlikely, as the value of the deal would have to exceed the value that the second party could make from forcing Melvin into a squeeze and selling them shares at inflated market prices. However, dismissing this theory would be foolish because hedge funds generally tend to have friends in high places.
   * **Watch out, because this is better for Melvin because they wont be at the mercy of the open market, and it would be better for the second party because they could guarantee 100%,200% etc returns instead of trying to play the short squeeze.**

**This isnt a 🌈🐻 post because GME will still moon, but be on the lookout for any institutional bullshit**

Now for the timeline. These are my predictions (assuming none of the above happens and a normal squeeze happens)

* **Jan 1-15ish:** We know that GameStop will be releasing their holiday sales in early/mid january, so expect a run up before then 20-25 range is my expectation. I am also expecting there to be a lot more volume as it's likely that shorts will gradually try to cover some of their shares beginning the 3rd. **THE SQUEEZE COULD HAPPEN OR START BEFORE JAN 15.  IF IT DOESNT, MY PRICE TARGETS ARE BELOW** 
* **After report:** This one is difficult because while most people are expecting GameStop to blow this out of the water, there are some external factors that could hinder this. USPS is overloaded and unable to mail packages on time (happening with almost every retailer). Also, FedEx is no longer shipping packages form high volume stores (I.E. gamestop).
   * This may hurt gamestop, as many people (that I know of) have been canceling orders that are backlogged or delayed for more than a month in the future. It is important to have a realistic idea of all possible situations, and while I hope this wont have a negative affect on gamestop, it is possible. If it does and they don't report extremely good results, expect a reasonable dip (probably not as bad as last earnings dip because I doubt there will be any more short attacks, don't be a paper hand bitch)
* March PT: $30-35
* July PT: $50-60

It is impossible to time the squeeze and it will only happen when there are no more sellers. Before that happens, I suspect there will be way more  buy-side action than sell side, which will gradually drive up the price. In this situation, the shorts consist of two known big players (Melvin, BoA). This means that they can **cover with strategy Instead of frantic selling.** This means that they will drive the price up **GRADUALLY for as long as possible** before a frantic squeeze. I do not think we would see a dramatic squeeze before the price hit $40. Below is a nice graph of how I think it will happen:

[A diagram of gradual covering before a dick shaped squeeze that will likely happen](https://preview.redd.it/myzkbnnltk861.png?width=1042&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6d2cd489762b3b7d8525e1709954737b0d23c52)

Many people will see GME hit 40, 50, and take profits, and as long as there are sellers, the shorts will not be squeezed. Hold through the gradual increase if you want to reap crazy % returns.

WSB ---2021 New Years Resolutions,0.96,"Alright you fellow retards lets all agree to perhaps maybe hit the ground running a little different going into the next year.  We've had a great year already so lets not let the Boomers win and say ""seeeee the Wall Street Bets crowd ultimately got it wrong.""  Here is a list of random thoughts/advice/and new years resolutions for 2021.  Feel free to add to it in the comments below:

1- FUCKING STOP buying weekly options that are far OTM.  Like just stop.  Its stupid as FUCK.  Buy options that have at least 30 DTE so you have a chance for the position to set up.  You can always go back and sell those OTM weeklys against your new monthly calls to some other retard and see how stupid it is.  Or worst case you can roll out those options and keep making more money---THIS IS THE WAY 

2-Seriously why isn't there a $WSB etf?  Right there is our Ticker.  Someone smart who knows these things please start up an ETF with all of our favorites so the lazy FUCKS who just want to go along for the ride can get exposure.  Also its an ETF----young people love anything that is an ETF and raises the share prices so we all win.  Someone make that happen and I'll buy the first 100 shares

3- Loss porn is funny.  But you know what we should make a thing with 2021??? Tendie parties.  I wanna instead see the insane stupid things people buy with their tendies instead of knowing they stayed in the casino where the house always wins.  I'm talking tigers and boats and shit!  Looking at you GME gang.  This is the year where we get our wives back by giving them DDD implants!  You need them for a flotation device incase your private planes crash.  So its an investment!

4- Options are great, but remember that the secret is out on us now.  Massive buying of options alone doesn't move share price.  You know what does?  BUYING STONKS!!!!  Put half into stocks and other half into options.  

5- I love it when shit moons🚀🚀🚀🛸🛸🛸.  Like mmmmmmm gets daddy hard in the morning.  But I'm going to end up jacking off while my wife fucks her boyfriend if I don't do some profit taking.  Sell calls at the highs, pair back positions.  I love you diamond hand fucks, but remember the people that are telling you to hold as shit drops are probably the ones who have already hedged their profits.  

6- I still want Uncle Cramer to ask me to sit on his lap in 2021 and tell me what a good boy I've been.  So lets spend the entire year crushing it so we can get hopefully touched by Uncle and a pat on our bottoms at the end of the year when we truly fucking take this shit over to the next level

7- Lastly: more memes please? its the only thing that makes me laugh when I see my account is down 10% intraday---I know I'm a fucking pussy for not risking it all on stupid shit.  10% is pussy shit---so yea keep em coming!

Any other resolutions?  Remember its a long game---Boomers would love more than anything to say we are ultimately wrong.  They don't understand we are here to fuck shit up and tear down the status quo.  Lets outlive these geriatric fucks so we can run the money printer one day!

EDIT POSITIONS: 3700 shares AMD at $77; 300 GME shares at $17.23; 6 Feb 21 $20 calls long -3 Jan $22 calls -3 jan $25 calls; 400 PLTR shares at $16.27 5 Jan 22 $35 at $14.00 oooof -3 jan 15 $29 calls

Ryan Cohen is About to Light This Shit Up 🚀🚀🚀,0.96,"By now you've likely seen the newest tweet today from our friendly Canadian benefactor, Mr. [Ryan Cohen](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1344687817998401537).  

He simply writes ""Breaking News"" and included a graphic and a portion of a Ben Franklin quote ""An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.""  

Here is the rest of that quote in context.  It comes from a letter that Ben Franklin wrote in 1735 entitled ""On Protection of Towns from Fire.""  (H/t u/DrZaius0)

\*

*Being old and lame of my Hands, and thereby uncapable of assisting my Fellow Citizens, when their Houses are on Fire;* ***I must beg them to take in good Part the following Hints on the Subject of Fires****.*

*In the first Place,* ***as an Ounce of Prevention is worth a Pound of Cure****, I would advise ’em to take Care* ***how they suffer living Brands-ends****, or Coals in a full Shovel, to be carried out of one Room into another, or up or down Stairs, unless in a Warmingpan shut; for Scraps of Fire may fall into Chinks, and make no Appearance till Midnight; when your Stairs being in Flames,* ***you may be forced . . .to leap out of your Windows, and hazard your Necks to avoid being over-roasted****.*

*\**

Lots of ways to interpret this latest ambiguous tweet from our man RC.  Time to prevent GME from becoming Blockbuster and stop doing Dumb Boomer Shit, for example.  

But if you're familiar with my prior [ramblings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kito44/gme_short_squeeze_and_ryan_cohen_dd_for_jim/) on the [subject of Ryan Cohen](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kakxrm/gme_tribe_a_story_about_how_ryan_cohen_is_about/), you might assume that I'm going with: ***our man is about to seal off all the doors and windows here and light this shit up***.  This could be his final warning.

A sharp observer over at ST noted that this tweet came on the heels of a major buy this AM and a reversal from the trending downturn:

""An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."" Idk what this meant so I typed in google and got this answer "" it's easier to stop something from happening in the first place than to repair the damage after it has happened. ""

I think this is a strong message for all the shorts frantically covering their positions right now. He's obviously referring to the short squeeze here and warning all the shorts to cover their positions now before MOASS happens.

I think the short squeeze is imminent. There will be some bombs dropped in the near future.

"The Mother of All Short Squeezes: GME, is it a myth?",0.54,"Preface: I have no positions in GME currently.

&#x200B;

**The Mother of All Short Squeezes**

Volkswagen is often referred to as the ""mother of all short squeezes."" This short squeeze temporarily gave Volkswagen the largest market capitalization of any company in the world in 2008, when it quadruled in size over a few days (400% gain):

https://preview.redd.it/ibsya8j7qi861.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f7d6df799e607c9d33c18fc6d02c366eaf5d37c

Many hedge funds were short Volkswagen, and were caught off guard when Porsche announced that it had effectively gained control of 74% of Volkswagen's voting shares. There was a very short supply of Volkswagen shares with which to cover short positions with, leading the stock to soar as hedge funds desperately tried to cover their positions.

The unexpected news, combined with a very small float (= tradable shares) and large number of short positions, conspired to drive the shares through the roof. Some hedge funds are reported to have lost billions as a result of the squeeze.  

To put this in numbers: 1m shares were traded daily on average before the squeeze, and the available float was 135m shares at the time. This meant when funds came to buy back their shorts, sellers could charge a premium as there were so few willing to sell, driving the price up. It would take on average, 1/3 of a year for the whole float to change hands!

So the main point here is that a limited supply of shares is crucial for a true **short squeeze**. 

&#x200B;

**So does this apply to GME?**

There are 60m total shares available in the float for GameStop. The average daily trading volume for GME is **15m shares**. That means the entire float is traded in 4 days, basically weekly! This incredible amount of liquidity means supply is never a problem.

If funds had to buy back in to close their short position, they could, and the price would barely move. They would not have a hard time covering their position, and could buy back in without anyone ever noticing (until the next bi-weekly short interest report is released, which by then would be too late).

Just yesterday on a slow day 6m shares were traded (1/10 available), with less than 1% change in the price. Also this translates to $115 million exchanging hands, in one day. This kind of money isn't retail, it'll be market makers and funds who know all this information and more.

Whilst it's true the short interest is high for GME, around 50%-100% (over 10% is considered substantial), the fact that supply is not an issue, means the risk for these funds has not increased substantially. And it's all about the risk/reward in this game.

&#x200B;

And so for that reason you autists, I'm afraid the impeding short squeeze is just a myth.

"Have faith in RC, GME retards!",0.94,"Greetings retards! 

In my last post on Melvin’s put options fuckery, I showed that they bought more than $8m worth of 15 Jan $17P/$24P bearish put spreads. Since then, they might have bought another $3m of 15 Jan $17P and 19 Feb $21P bearish diagonal spreads on 29 Dec. (8000 contracts were done discreetly in about 16 smaller transactions. They know us autists are stalking them.)

What these put spreads show is that Melvin is betting on Gamestop to disappoint in its holiday sales update in Jan, and for CEO George Sherman to once again reiterate “omnichannel” over and over at the ICR conference on 11 Jan.

Is Melvin right? I think GameStop has good odds of beating last year’s abysmal holiday sales ($1.84bn in sales, 24.5% decrease from 2018). Sherman hinted at the 3Q call that 4Q was profitable and may even have some kind of ace up his sleeve @ ICR (e-sports?), seeing that he moved GameStop’s presentation slot from the Retail track to the Technology track.

But even the most bullish GME retard can’t deny that beating profit/loss estimates does fuck all for GME’s shareprice (3Q EPS beat consensus by 37%). The fact is that Sherman’s operationalisation of GME’s technology turnaround has the speed and nimbleness of the Titanic trying to get around an iceberg. That he is presenting at ICR after Zoom (56x P/sales) and Asana (22x P/sales) just highlights how far GME (0.25x P/sales) has to go and the amount of convincing that needs to be done to get that obscene tech forward sales multiple. In the meantime, Melvin is going to pull out all the stops to drive the price down to $17, as seen on Tues when GME fell from $20.82 to a low of $18.56. 

So are your 15/1 $24C fucked? Not if our Lord and Saviour RC can help it. Last night, RC tweeted one of his retarded emojis after some CNBC shill put down GME stock. The last time RC did the same (on 10 Dec), he proceeded to buy $37m worth of stock over four days, and drove GME price up 53% from $12.78-$19.46 when his updated 13D came out on 21 Dec. That’s 11 days baby...and what is 11 days from today? 11 Jan - the date when Sherman’s gonna try to toot his own horn @ ICR. But we will all know that when GME goes to $30 from now til 15 Jan, it’s not gonna be because of omnichannel, but because of RC.

theres a lot of customers in the next gen console megathread complaining that they havent gotten tracking numbers or anything for console bundles they ordered weeks ago. This is probably due to the shipping issues Fed Ex has presented BUT the eternal skeptic in me thinks theres an outside chance a company managed by total shitheads would sell consoles to customers that the store doesnt have yet.

Ryan Cohen's vision/strategy for GME,0.95,"I found this video of Ryan Cohen talking about Chewey on CNBC. I recommend you watch all of it to get  familiar with his strategy:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z31hgjEyVIc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z31hgjEyVIc)

""If you're in the business of delighting your customers I think that you could be very successful and I think we would've been successful in any category \[other than pet supplies\]"".

He emphasizes that the secret to Chewey's success was creating a great **experience** for the customer. He also mentions that for any e-commerce business to succeed three factors are important:  ""fast shipping, being competitively priced, and having the selection.""

Frankly, his obsession with customer experience reminded me of Jeff Bezos's famous 1999 interview in which he repeats ""customer service"" like a million times.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GltlJO56S1g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GltlJO56S1g)

Why Cohen is Vital to a $GME Success Story,0.93,"Good evening, gentleman, I have been doing a bit of digging into GameStop and I found something I thought was worth posting about and would further add to everyone's confirmation bias.

I happened to be looking at various company reviews on glassdoor and I figured I would look at the company I have my life savings invested in ($GME). Most of the reviews were from sales associates and people who worked at physical locations. I narrowed it down to district managers because I figured they would have a better feel for how the company is run as a whole and not just how an individual store is run. I found one review that immediately stuck out and hit the nail on the head as to why Ryan Cohen is such a vital component to GameStops hopeful success story. From a former employee who worked there for more than 10 years, under the cons section: ""Management treats people as a number and doesn't care."" And then under advice to management: ""Focus on PEOPLE! they will bring you profit."" I think that this right here is the essence of why Ryan Cohen is the person to turn this company around. Cohen knows that putting people over profit ultimately leads to higher profits. Let me tell you a story to explain to you why Cohen is the right person for this. Coincidentally, about a year ago my mother had bought a few things from Chewy (founded by Ryan Cohen) online for our cats. After placing the order she realized that she forgot to add something small to her cart before checking out. She called their customer service number and told them what had happened and asked if she could add it to the order and get it charged to her card so she didn't have to pay for shipping on a whole new order. The lady on the phone, without hesitation, politely told her that she would add it to the order and that she would just give it to us for free out of appreciation for giving them our business. Since then every single item we have gotten for our animals has come from Chewy, because we simply like the company and how they treat their customers. This is what Ryan Cohen can bring to GameStop. With RC, GameStop has the potential to transform a dying company focused more on profits than the customer, to a successful, rapidly growing company that puts it customers first.

Further, Boomer CEO George Sherman only has a 28% approval rating among employees. This proves that the only true way for GameStop to transform into what Cohen wants it to be is to oust the board and find a new CEO. It is very hard to be bullish on a company who's CEO only has a 28% approval rating with its own employees. If GameStop wants a successful future, Sherman needs to go.

Should the 1B market cap rule apply to SPACs ?,0.82,"Should the 1B market cap rule apply to SPACs?

This sub has a rule that bans tickers below 1B market cap. This is to avoid pump and dump on small cap / shitty penny stocks, market manipulation, etc. 

A lot of SPACs are going to be worth 1B+ after merger. One thing about SPACs is that they have a price floor, usually at $10 (NAV), since shareholders can redeem shares for cash, pump and dump can't happen if people are purchasing shares around $10/11. 

For example, I got in CllC and THC bee at about $11 after reading the DD posted and made a killing. Now the poster said he can't post his DD cuz the SPACs are just below 1B.

Even the sub's favorite, GME was below 1B market cap just a month ago.

If the rule is to avoid pump and dump or market manipulation, **could mods consider adjusting the rule so that SPACs near $10 can be mentioned?** Or SPACs with a post merger market cap of over 1B?",2020-12-31 02:06:31

What will it take to change GME shorts investment thesis?,0.96,"As a GME holder, been thinking about what will have to happen to cause shorts to change their investment thesis. Part of it could be a change in timeline, if GME lasts 5+ years rather than the 1-2 years shorts expected, that could be enough to change an investment thesis. Another is that regardless of timeline, shorts probably compare GME to Blockbuster and no matter how long, it's gonna be toast. So even though GME is undervalued right now they obviously do need a strategy for a long-term position in the gaming industry with games becoming more digital.

Maybe they create an E-sports gaming hub? Maybe they successfully transition to being an online gaming retailer with a new strategic partnership with Microsoft? With the promising 200+% online sales growth, there's a real chance the 2nd option could happen without a major change.

So to the GME shorts lurking, what would it take for y'all to change your thesis?  Also what're y'all gonna do if/when the comparison goes from Blockbuster to Netflix?

\*\*Edit: Just to clarify, the Netflix comparison is a metaphor for a successful pivot in a changing industry.",2020-12-30 16:30:10
GME Shorts vs Hedge Fund Margin,0.83,"Does anyone have an idea of roughly what % of a hedge funds assets they would keep freed up to use for margin?  It seems like they would keep most of it invested so that it's being useful and making money.  The thing is as GME's price increases the amount of margin required to keep that short position is getting pretty huge.  If we assume they have to keep 130% of the shares value in margin, at a price point of $22 (about the highest it's gotten recently) that would take \~2 billion in margin to keep that position open.  Melvin Capital for instance has roughly 20 billion in positions on their 13F-HR.  Now this short position could be spread over a few people, but I think there's a reasonable chance it isn't.  Think about it, as it became clear that gme wasn't going away anyone with a smaller position would have unwound it because they knew melvin would be forced to keep it from mooning.

"Aphria Inc (APHA): yes it's cannabis, yes it's about to get you high on gains in 2021 😮‍💨🥦🚀🚀🚀",0.79,"I think most of you already saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k450e6/why_apha_is_set_for_a_50_gain/) by [u/WatAb0utB0b](https://www.reddit.com/user/WatAb0utB0b/) about a month ago. I'm here to tell you what has changed since then. Everything is in these two articles: [Bloomberg](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/30/does-113-for-this-merger-between-two-cannabis-heav/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article), [The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/30/does-113-for-this-merger-between-two-cannabis-heav/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article). Because you autists have the attention span of a chimpanzee, I'll give an executive summary.

1. **Juicy merger for super dank weed company**  
On the 16th of December, Aphria and Tilray announced that they will merge to form the 2nd biggest exchange traded company of the cannabis market. They will form under Tilray's ticker, but Aphria stock owners will get a 62% stake in Tilray while current Tilray owners will keep a 38% stake. This will allow them to cut costs and get even stronger financials. The merger is expected to happen in the second quarter of 2021.
2. **Cannabis is still an attractive growth market**  
A lot of people are sceptical for cannabis since the last few years the stock has jumped up and down a few times through cycles of hype and disillusion. This time, all the cards are laid out right. Aphria is based in Canada, Tilray in USA: North-America is getting addicted. Boomer orange man has obstructed the market, but Sleepy Joe loves his cannabis so we're good for atleast the next 4 years.   
It's not just NA either, in the EU medicinal cannabis use and other legal CBD products are getting more and more popular, which implies an enormous growth opportunity. Tilray is already partnered with AB Inbev for CBD drinks and Aphria had acquired a sweet drink company (see last post) so they will fit together perfectly. Year after year, performance improves and astonishing growth rates can be found in financial reports (also see last post).
3. **Stock price is cheap, perfect time to get in**  
I jumped in with that last post a bit prematurely (30 shares @ 8.74), the stock price has gone down more than 20% since then. This is because of [🌈🐻 bears that are shorting the cannabis market massively and losing](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cannabis-short-sellers-now-down-155011384.html?),  $236.9 million total in short interest for APHA . It's time to beat them to the ground once again, like WSB is doing right now with GME.  
Currently APHA is noted at around $7, [analysts](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=apha) predict a median price target of $8.64 in the next year (+24%). None of the analysts are giving negative advice, it's all positive with most of them on a 'buy' advice. All of these advices are pretty conservative, weed stock is pretty volatile so the minute good news comes in through the merger or Biden administration you should expect big gains. I would project the price to reach 2017/2018 prices again if you guys diamond hand the fuck out of this stock.

**TL:DR** I'm passing you guys the boof on this massive gain opportunity. APHA is cheap atm and has good forecasts in the future with upcoming merger and Biden administration (+ worldwide growth opportunities). Let's reach another dimension with this stock.

GME Gang - Share Lending Education for Dummies,0.97,"GME Gang,

Your energy is incredible. Look how far we’ve come from August. And the shorts remain more fucked now than ever before. 💎🥜.

I won’t rehash the whole story—if you can read you already know it. If you can’t, you’ve watched plenty of epic memes & videos that convinced you to use your Wendy’s paycheck to buy 13 shares. 

Now, what many of you don’t know is how the fuck there can be more than 100% of shares short. Well, I had wondered the same thing many months ago when this shit blew up during the Hestia-Permit proxy fight this Spring. So I’m just here to drop some knowledge about share lending:

1.	⁠GTC limit orders don’t do shit to inhibit lendability. GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEADS. While your beautiful $420.69 limit may excite you, it don't mean shit for share lending.
2.	⁠Shares held in cash accounts can only be lent with your explicit permission (e.g. enrollment into a lending program like @ IBKR, Schwab, etc.). When this starts going berserk they will reach out and offer you low at first, eventually ridiculous annualized interest rates to opt in. I had both Schwab and IBKR emailing and CALLING (who the fuck does that?) me to lend my shares. Look at the historical interest rates at IBKR (https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) during the proxy recall this Spring as a proof point. 200%+ annualized interest! This is some loan shark shit! The shorts held on then because who TF is terrified of Hestia-Permit, two institutions who you never heard of before either until this saga. This time it’s Ryan “my motherfucking poodle Tylee will shit on you” Cohen. The game has changed (https://g.co/kgs/xd9uRV)
3.	⁠Shares held in a margin account can and will be lent, unless you are NOT using any margin and the position is fully cash secured. Now, even with this in mind shady brokers (looking at you Robinhood, WeBull, Fidelity, etc.) have in their hypothecation agreements that they’ll always be lending shares held in margin accounts. EVERY SHARE BOUGHT ON MARGIN IS ANOTHER SHARE LENT OUT. Those prime broker fuckers are frothing at the mouth to lend all shares (even synthetic ones) that exist (and then some, thanks to synthetic longs—see S3 Partners’ Ihor Dusaniwsky’s excellent writeup here that specifically discusses GME: https://www.shortsight.com/short-interest-of-float-2-0/ ). They’ve been doing it for years (see my Twitter for some charting on the shares short vs. price vs. short interest on max and other charts) and will gladly keep making $$$ off your shares.

That is all. Godspeed, GameStop. And praise be to the GME Gang as we fight for our hard earned tendies! The market is opening in one minute, crush the upvote & show up in the comments!!!

TL;DR: If you’re buying shares on margin you’re giving the shorts free lending ammunition. If you want to ensure you have voting rights to your shares contact your broker, or move shares held in a margin account to a cash account.",2020-12-30 14:29:00

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
There are lots of posts tonight speculating about whether today was an attempt by shorts to push down GME before year end.

I opened the [NYSE Short Sale Restriction list for 12/29](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/notices)\* and found that SRR was triggered at 10:07. This corresponds [neatly on the 1min chart](https://i.imgur.com/47g3qdY.png) with the end of GME's freefall this morning. Coincidence? I don't think so!

/\* Open SRR List ftp link, use ""anonymous"" login.

Ok, so what? Well, notice the restriction ends 12/31. I expect they'll do it again on 12/31 as a last hurrah to polish the books before 2020 closes and I'll be waiting to buy the fucking dip!

**TL;DR - there is a smoking gun for today's raid. They will do it again 12/31. Buy the m'effin dip.**

Why do you all blindly follow $GME?,0.34,"I understand most of you read at a 3rd grade level so I’ll try to keep this short and pretty.  Why do nearly ALL of you think $GME is a buy other than because people with more money than you like it?

Revenue share deal with Microsoft + Sony (which the public, from my research, does not know the scope of)

Closed 400 stores which will (I think) only boost their bottom line?

One dimensional company; stores like Walmart and BestBuy offer the same product

122% GME Shares Held By Institutions. WTF & Does It Matter? 🚀🚀🚀,0.95,"[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME) I know this is not the most complete or accurate data, but I think it's solid enough to make a point and ask a question.  


u/ahminus confirmed to me that, after each short position, there must inevitably be a new long position, because somebody bought the shorted share. And that makes sense, after all. If we simplify things by saying that 100% of outstanding shares have been shorted, that means we have roughly 200% long positions for GME, compared to outstanding shares. Add that to the list of ridiculous things about this stock...

If I'm interpreting this in a retarded, incorrect way, teach me the right way, because we're here to know... the way.

Anyway, if only 122% of those 200% long positions are held by institutions, that's basically 61%. Compared to Best Buy for example [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBY/holders?p=BBY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBY/holders?p=BBY)  
or Target [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TGT/holders?p=TGT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TGT/holders?p=TGT) we're still a long ways off. I know, not the most relevant examples, but gaybears often cite those 2 companies as better places to go and buy gaming shit, so I figured why not compare them in this regard too.

Obviously, we could include Cohen's 13% into this calculation, even though he's technically an Insider. That does brings us a bit closer to the 2 examples above.

Either way, this begs the question. ***Ignoring all the other factors for the moment (I know, hard to ignore that 100% short interest...) how much more juice do we have left in this engine if this stock achieves, umm... respectable, 'established' percentage of institutional ownership?!***

Because, we all know, deep in our hearts, that despite all our efforts and meme energy, we don't have enough buying power to keep pumping the stock price up for the next 3-9 months. It is these multi-hundred-billion $$$ tutes that move the needle, as always.

POSITION: europoor 231 shares @ $15.41. Salary coming soon, dumping all of it in shares, at whatever price...

PS. Fuck all the shills and  🌈🐻. Don't get fooled by their digital sales > physical sales trend. What they don't pay attention to is that gaming as a whole is growing as a whole year over year. If sales goes from 100M to 200M, you can skew graphs to make it look like physical gaming is dying when in fact physical games haven't lost traction at all. Also they are comparing end of console sales to the start of super gaming cycle. Get your GME before this MOASS to the fucken next solar system.",2020-12-30 02:24:18

Rally Cries for GME Gang!!!,0.96,"  

Well GME gang… here we are. Yesterday, the gay bears fired a warning shot across our bow, and we ignored it. Our cash-colored glasses blinded us from seeing the true intent behind their perceived tomfoolery. We dropped our guard and became too comfortable with our gains and the positions we held with our hands of diamond. Our neglect to respond to that act gave them all the confidence they needed to launch a full out assault on GME Gang.

The result has been a true massacre. At exactly 0930 hours, Melvin Capital and their gay friends invaded our investment accounts and choked us with their girthy red bear dicks. We were unprepared for the attack, and, as a result, our army suffered mass casualties. We lost many of our brethren today. Men who had the best of intentions but the paper-iest of hands. Their tendies… lost to the ever-churning war machine.

The intent of the bears was not only to crush our spirits, but to offset some of their losses in order to regain the confidence of their boomer investors on their end-of-year report. This would, in turn, give them more ammunition to continue fighting this war. 

But I have 5 words for those rainbow-dicked prostate smoochers over at Melvin:

The. Year. Isn’t. Over. Yet.

Yeah. That’s right. Tomorrow is December 30th. December FUCKING 30th. Twenty MOTHERFUCKING TWENTY.

It’s time to remind them that we own >5% of this fucking company, and we make the fucking rules.

Rally the troops. All of them. Theta gang. r/investing. Your fucking grandma. Everyone. Tonight we ride across the digital countryside like PAUL FUCKING REVERE and spread the gospel of u/DeepFuckingValue LIKE IT’S FUCKING COVID. Let every autist with a Robinhood account and boomer with a 401k alike know that THE SQUEEZE IS UPON US AND WE MUST BUY SHARES TO FULFILL THE DESTINY OF DADDY COHEN.

Let tomorrow be a day of reckoning for bears across the globe. Show them that the strength of our collective retardation knows no bounds.

Today, we are retards. Today, we are low-functioning autists. Today, we eat tendie scraps in the basement.

Tomorrow, we are the market makers. Tomorrow, we are our wife’s boyfriends. Tomorrow, we dine in VALHALLA.

RETARDS.

TOGETHER.

MM's holding RKT to 20.75 = unsustainable 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,0.82,"🚀🚀🚀 RKT closed green 1.2% today after having $40 million sold short 

MM's don't want to pay out the $21 calls for Dec 31. Next week it would make sense for them to de-risk those shorts and allow the stock to move up to 22 for the Jan 15 expiry since there's 11k open interest for 1/15 22 strike calls. IF they are successful in keeping the stock below $22 until January 15 it will take a lot more shorting, and an even greater squeeze potential. This could be a GME type situation by February.

If you want a little DD, they tripled their quarterly revenue year over year in their last earnings report, you can do the rest of your DD yourself

Some **position options**: **buy shares** 🚀🚀

**buy** Jan $22 **calls** with a break even of 22.60 (theta .03) 🚀🚀

Buy **covered calls** if you think they will be successful in holding the stock below $22 = **$20.15 average** shares cost (buy lots of 100 shares and sell Jan 15 22 calls) 🌈🚀

If you are super conservative (read: paper hands/building long term position) **sell cash secured puts** at $20 for a max gain of $75 per contract and a **$19.25 average cost of shares** if it drops 🌈🚀

And if you're unsure if you have a margin account or not, [by default](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-accounts/), you have a margin account. Keep options and whatever other not crazily shorted shit in your RH account, but for stuff like GME, why make it easy for Melvin?

So what can you do to screw over those greedy shorts who have manipulated GME for far too long? Either switch your Robinhood account to a cash account (but then no more instant deposits), or if you still want those instant deposits, move over your GME holdings to another broker like Fidelity or Schwab with a non-margin account.

Best of all, if you buy from some toilet paper hands on Robinhood that get scared off on days like today, then you're helping fortify the front line! Imagine if WSB can take another 1-2% of the float away from shorts!

There is still time for you to board the ride of your life: 12/31/2020

Forget about spending time with family. Forget about your wife - she's busy fucking her boyfriend anyways. This is more important.

**THE FINAL BATTLE OF 2020 AGAINST THE MELVIN CUCKS IS UPON US.**

Listen up and listen close.

GME dropped from $21 to a low of $18.who-gives-a-fuck today.

This was orchestrated by Melvin Capital. Tomorrow, they're going to try to do the same. SSR will make this difficult tomorrow though.

**On 12/31, they're going to try to drop this stock AS LOW AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN.**

*But, uh, sir swanpenguin, why uh is this so important sir? Why do it now?* 🥺👉👈

Lemme fill you in on a little secret.

Melvin Capital wants to raise as much money as possible to try to survive the absolute disaster that is their GME short play. 2020 annual performance is CRITICAL to how much money they can raise.

**12/31 IS THE FINAL DAY OF 2020**

These motherfuckers are DROWNING. They will do everything they can to drop the price as low as possible by EOD 12/31. They will pull every dirty trick they can to manipulate this stock down into the fucking ground so this mess looks manageable (spoiler: it isn't) .

What does this mean for you?

This means the best damn buying opportunity of your life to get in on HISTORY. You won't see a lower stock price and you can bet your ass you'll be watching us 🚀🚀🚀🚀 to the 🌝 if you miss the ride.

Will we see $16 or below on 12/31? Probably not. $17-18 is fair game though.

**TL;DR: SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY ON GME SHARES 12/31 WHEN IT DIPS AND DON'T BE A 🧻🤏💩. HOLD FOR THE SHORT SQUEEZE OF YOUR LIFE.**

BBY - Your next 10 bagger,0.65,"
Listen fellow retards, the analysts are sleeping on this stock. It's insanely undervalued. 

&#x200B;

From BBY last earnings call - “From a profitability standpoint, our better-than-expected sales resulted in significant operating income rate expansion and earnings growth,” stated Best Buy CEO Corie Barry. 

BBY is hands down the best managed retailer out there. So why is the stock tanking for the last 2 months? Because analysts are retarded and things have changed since the last reputable analyst call. Goldman downgraded the stock early december since they don't see how it can continue to grow. Since then, we have had $600 in direct payments AND we might get another $2,000. Last stimulus, majority of it went to durable goods aka electronics. The government wants to straight up give you money to buy PS5 AND Xbox with a 65"" TV to go along with it. Good thing BBY sells all of these AND they are preferred for electronics over any other retailers. 

But analysts don't want you to know that. Smart money is already accumulating BBY while you yolo PLTR. 

Here's what 4hour on BBY looks like right now:

What the fuck do those yellow balls mean? In the most simple terms, it can show accumulation/distribution. So what happens when it squeezes like that? Look at what it did in below examples: 

1) Goodrx - GDRX

Non meme plays since yall keep losing so much on meme plays,0.68,"The most boomer of plays is the utility stock and its a missed opportunity here. These stocks generally underperform the market due to their low risk, but their dividends are nice so people buy them. But while I would not hold the underlying shares, the calls in this do so well if you can time the play. And I think its just about time where utilities are primed to go off...like 10%.

Why the fuck would you want to buy something that goes up 10% when you all keep chasing 100% with GME or LAZR or some shit?

The call premiums are incredibly cheap on utilities, but the deltas and gammas are massive relative to the underlying premiums. That means that if the utilities rise even 5-10%, the underlying calls go up like 100% or more!

I think utilities are primed especially now since portfolios are being reallocated right now and into the beginning of the year. People use utilities as a safe investment since bonds suck and they can at least get some dividends from these companies. So there may be some asset reallocation into utilities in the coming days. Utilities also tend to go up like 5-10% within a short time and then consolidate for a long time and then gap up again (usually gaining like 10-15% a year). Technical voodoo shows that RSI is oversold for most utilities and MACD is alsoshowing a reversal in the trend. Short term, calls out a couple months is where I'm at (Feb/March calls).

Longer term, utilities are an interesting play with people buying more EVs, more things that need electricity, and interest rates staying low. What do interest rates have to do with anything? Well low interest rates mean utilities can borrow money cheaply for capital expenditures. And every utility company is heavily investing in solar and wind farms and other clean energy. Plus, the recent ITC extension by Congress in the stimulus means these utilities are going to ramp up their investments in clean energy even more. These investments mean cheaper energy generation and so less overhead costs etc and potentially more profit in the long run. 

For these reasons, I'm in NEE, AEP, AES, XEL, and SRE periodically for the long term (that is buy on big dips and buy during consolidation a couple months out for the GAINS!).

GME Analysis of Shares Currently Being Shorted Today,0.95,"https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME

So I was interested in what was causing the spike in the downward trend of the GME stock this morning and once being shared this link, I began analysing Melvin and other shorters approach.

What I noticed is that they firstly bought 60k worth of shorts limiting the available amount from 100k to 40k. This is not a lot and we all know it! Since then they are actually trying to ease off a bit and have begun reducing their short shares amount. Between 9.30am and 10.30am the number actually increased from 40k to 60k!

So what does this mean? Well quite simply this is market manipulation at it's finest and IMO they're very scared and we're close to the endgame. We just need to trust our process and DD and not fold with paper hands. They are literally trying to shake trees and see if anything falls out. The fact that they are easing their position between 9.30am and 10.30am means they know it cant't go on forever.

My guess is they want their EOY results to be good and are just trying to make it to next year! My recommendation is to BTFD and I would honestly buy more if I had any more available funds. Good luck everyone and keep your hands firmly on your shares.

PSTH Bumble rumor,0.5,"This is my first post here, I have been a lurker jn and out over last 2 years, but have been following along closely this last month.  I am long GME, PLTR, and PSTH.  I have also been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, but am able to manage it effectively with marijuana and delta-8.  I am able to take my paychecks from my jobs at CVS and Amazon Fulfillment center and fund my weed and delta 8 medication (I live in a state where it is not medicinal or recreationally legal) by trading on RobinHood. However I made some bad trades recently and lost most of my money. 

That said I am YOLO’ing my entire account on PSTH. And here’s why, I rely on my cousin to loan me money to keep my weed/delta 8 inventory supplied, and he is getting a MBA at a top school right now and is recruiting investment banking for Sponsors groups.  He told me that he was having a call with a person at one of those big banks that’s not Goldman Sachs, and that that group told him they had met with Bumble and Bill Ackman recently.  It just now occurred to me that that was a PSTH de-SPAC meeting and Ackman is assessing them as a target.  Stripe is off Bumble is on.  This would go right in line with Bill Ackman’s woke empowerment angle.  

I don’t know if that makes sense as a long-term play, but it would definitely pop in the short term if it were announced.  Blackstone could be looking to monetize on its investment last year.

Question on Incentive Structures for HF,0.8,"It's been widely reported that not only does Melvin Capital have a significant short position but that their second-largest long position is Alibaba. They have 3.26 million shares an increase from 2.37 million last Q. Melvin Capital has 13.1 billion assets under management. As a non-finance guy, I was wondering what the incentive structure would like for a fund like this? ... Is their exposure to BABA as well as their significant losses in their short position in GME enough to force them to close? Will they be incentived to close before/after the new year for bonuses? I have no idea how the industry works, in terms of bonuses, so was hoping someone could educate me so I could decide whether to buy more GME calls. Thanks",2020-12-28 23:45:37

BBBY earnings and technical play,0.89,"My last technical play [FCEL](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kghrjf/fcel_bull_flag_breakout/) worked out  so well (reached my 50% gain price target within a week), so I wanted to share a new play with hopes of recreating that magic. This one's a little different in that I'm entering sooner than I normally would, so I would start small and average in.

BBBY is exhibiting a wedge pattern and is on the verge of breaking out. Normally, I would wait for a confirmed  breakout with volume before getting in, but BBBY reports earnings on 1/7/21, so it might be too late to get in with a good price due to earnings IV pump. For reference, BBBY beat its last earning projection, and I would expect it to do well this quarter too. It's found good support at the low $18's, so unless it drops way below that, it's a low risk play to get in now imho. As an added bonus, like our darling GME, BBBY has a decent short interest too, so an earnings smash has the possibility for a good old squeeze.

I would look for post 1/7 calls with relatively low IV. 2/19 is probably the earliest I would go for now, with March a safer choice. Price target is difficult since it hasn't broken out yet, but I would put a conservative $26 target, and over $30 on an earnings blowout.

[12\/28\/2020 \(day of post\)](https://preview.redd.it/27lsmenk37861.png?width=988&format=png&auto=webp&s=135346ba6f28da67ad2e6b644bc2b00766f601b5)

\*12/29 update - I'm still waiting for the breakout but the ending was encouraging. We hit the 20 SMA (red line) in the morning before falling, but found support in the same low 18's we've had the entire wedge. Turning the 20 SMA from a resistance to a support is critical. February calls between 22 to 25 looked decent today, and I would even consider up to 30 for the March dates. For now, I've started a small 2/19 25C position and will look to continue adding every day. If we fall under $17 at any time, this play might need reconsideration.

\*\*12/30 update - Still no signs of a breakout. We managed to go above the 20 SMA, but still ended back under and inside the wedge EOD. Due to lower trading volume, odds of a breakout in the next few days seem unlikely. I'm holding a small amount of 2/19 calls, but may turn these into spreads to reduce cost and look to add March calls tomorrow for lower IV and theta. I probably won't post another update until something changes, but the things to look for are finding support and staying above $18, ending the day above the 20 SMA, and increasing volume on the way up. Hopefully, the buying picks up as we get closer to earnings.

\*\*\*12/31 update - I'll admit, this doesn't look good. Based on TA, we're very close to breaking out to the bottom, which further validates that I shouldn't have entered until a confirmed breakout. We broke under $18 and are sitting at the Oct 1st earnings breakout prices. With the high volume on 10/1, it should be mostly institutional buying so they're more likely to hold and even defend their prices, but if that breaks, we might be looking at sub $15 prices again. If Monday doesn't get us back above $18, I may have to cut my losses or play this strictly as an earnings play. For the record, I'm still bullish on the company and will look into LEAPS, but it may be painful holding anything short-term unless we get another great earnings.

\*\*\*\*1/5 update - Today looks likes the start of a breakout to the upside, so congrats to all who stayed in. We broke out of the wedge with strength and with good volume.  I would like to see increasing volume as we continue up. We're way above the 20 SMA so technicals look strong. Earnings is on Thursday before market, and IV is elevated so taking profits, or creating spreads tomorrow isn't too bad of an idea. This will likely be my last update on BBBY, since the near-term outlook is totally dependent on earnings. If we crush earnings, we'll probably get to my price targets. If they disappoint, I can easily see us get under $15.

&#x200B;

[1\/6\/2021 - sure looks like a breakout to me. good luck everyone.](https://preview.redd.it/sjv809ht2s961.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=e480855143de8cbda0f68b873ad9531fb8aba792)

One last update, I couldn't resist. It's arguable whether this play worked out for earnings. We ramped up and there were plenty of chances to take profit, but earnings did disappoint. The biggest takeaway after earnings was that we still defended near our $18 price floor. I updated my TA lines to extend the time frame, but it's clear we broke out. We reached my original $26 price target, so I'll be exiting the rest of my Feb calls today and sizing down my later ones to lock in profits. Hopefully, my next play will be a banger too, but I probably won't be sharing anymore for a while as I'm not too confident in the overall market in the near term. I'm not bearish yet, but I do believe that it's vulnerable.

November 30th gave birth to the first $18-$19 bagholders.

Moral of the story: don't get discouraged by Melvin Mondays. They're not crushing our hopes by bringing the price down from 22 back to 20 or even lower.

Importance of hedge fund year end performance for GME,0.95,"Hey fellow investors,

just wanted to add my two cent to the current discussion around GME and offer an explanation to what the fuck has been going on ever since the jump.

As you all know, there are a lot of hedge funds on the opposote side, shorting the shit out of GME. As we all know, they were already short at USD 6, so they completely drowning now, that we hit USD 20. 

On important thing to keep in mind, is that annual bonuses are extremely important for hedge funds and annual performance for 2020 will largely determine how much money they can raise for next year.

So in synopsis, these funds will do everything to keep the price level down until the end of the year! They will fight, manipulate and pull up every trick they now to keep that motherfucker down.

To all retards, which own stocks, that means you still have a couple of days to load up on stocks at the end of the trading day, when prices converge back to USD 20. My prediction is, that there will be a huge breakout in January, most likely after the conference or after christmas sales announcement.

For everyone, who worries about the recent price rise, keep in mind, that the company is still trading at 0.3x revenues, which is pretty much a distressed valuation.

My prediction is the following:

- min. USD 30 in January 
- min. USD 40 after Q4 earnings
- min. USD 60 at year end (roughly 1x revenues)
- infinity after Cohen becomes the new CEO

YOLO on GME 🚀🚀🚀 - will decide if I get married or if I die broke and alone,0.96,"Ok story time.

I know this isn’t the sub for soppy stories, so Ill keep it short. I’ve been dating this girl since high school and I’ve known for a while that she’s the one I’m going to marry. We are both juniors in college and have a shit ton of debt sitting on us, but we have been toying with the idea for a bit about getting married right after college.

Obviously, to do this I need money. I’ve been a safe investor and trader for around 3 years now, only buying ITM calls short term expiry and investing in blue chip stocks, but I’ve been following WSB for a bit now bc y’all are fuckin crazy and it makes my day watching some of the dumbass trades that somehow print bc stocks only go up not tits up (also, loss porn on here is 10/10). But I have come to an impasse. 

I’ve thought long and hard about this in the past 3 minutes and have decided to leave the fate of my relationship up to WSB pumping the market. Instead of buying an engagement ring for my girlfriend, I’m going to buy $GME 50x 1/22/21 $22c and hope to God that it works. If it does, I buy the ring and have money to pay off debts and maybe rent for an apartment with what’s left over (I’m still in school so I currently don’t have a job). If it tanks, then my girlfriend dumps me for her husband bc no chick would stay with a broke dumbass who YOLOd life savings on a GameStop.

Help me WSB bulls, you’re my only hope. GME to the fuckin moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Ryan Cohen fucks a stripper (gone sexual) (🚀🚀🚀🚀),0.75,"It was Monday morning on the 28th of December. Ryan had just woken up in his bed when he realized he had the taste of raw fish in his mouth. He tried to figure out where the fuck in his apartment there was raw fish and that’s when he heard a snore. He looked to his left when he to his surprise saw a woman. “Oh dear, **what have I done!?**” Exclaimed Ryan loudly in disbelief.

&#x200B;

**The day before:**

The three musketeers Ryan, Elon and Jack dumbfuck Ma had all planned to go to the new bar WSB to try and get laid before the new year. Jack had unfortunately been convicted for stealing Winnie the Pooh plushies and burning them on his roof. Needless to say, it was only Ryan and Elon that showed up. “Elon, it’s time.” Ryan opened the doors and instantly try were blinded by extreme RGB lighting. The so called bar looked more like a casino the more the two gentlemen looked around. And that was when they saw her. On the grandest of poles right in the center of roulette hall was the finest stripper Ryan and Elon had ever seen. The boys looked at each other and simultaneously started rushing towards the golden pole.

When Ryan had made it to the pole, the woman he had gazed at had started dressing and seemed ready to walk out. “Miss?” Ryan asked, who had made it first to her since Elon had stopped on the way to talk to some nerd about how he was planning on selling the moon. “And you are?” she asked, followed by a smile that triggered a huge blush on Ryan’s cheeks. It was at this moment that he knew what he had to do, he had to fuck her. “ My name is Ryan Cohen and I would be honored if I could bed you tonight miss?”. “Names Palantir. My shift just ended I have a room upstairs follow me” She took his hand and started leading him towards the edge of the hall. Thoughts were rushing through Ryan’s head like a rocket ship headed for the moon. He couldn’t understand how he had pulled this off. On the outside, she looked like the finest bitch he had ever seen.

&#x200B;

**Fast forward to the morning after:**

Ryan woke up with his heart beating aggressively and sweat dripping like something terrible had just happened. He instantly ripped his iPhone 20X from his golden nightstand and pressed the familiar Robin Hood app. Fuck, fuck! he mumbled until the numbers loaded: GME shares were up 15% in pre-market. A sigh of relief went out, he sat there alone in his bed wondering what an absolute retard you would have to be to buy fuckin Palantir calls just to get an own on Warren maddafuckin Buffet who can die literally any day for being a fat fucking boomer!!!

GME INCOMING SQUEEZE 12/28🚀,0.91,"Alrighty tards I am back and here is my TA on GME:

With all the DDs and internal information that is already out there on WSB about GME, I figured that I'd save you from hearing about the nonsense that everyone else has pretty much already said...

Instead, I decided to do my own Technical Analysis on GME:

The chart below is the full history of the GME stock, you can clearly see that there is a lot of resistance around the $21-23 range *(I know its hard to tell because its messy but just try to follow along as best as you can*). 

When we look at 2006, once it made a clear break of this $21-23 range, it shot up to $63.77. Especially in 2008-2012, there was a lot of consolidation around these price ranges but eventually did squeeze up to 57.70. Just to prove my point a bit deeper about this zone, around 2015-2016 prices finally came back down to the 21-23 range and guess what it did...**IT CONSOLIDATED IN THE $21-23 ZONE!** Once it broke that support, it took a pretty steep fall so in short... this 21-23 zone is a very strong zone to keep an eye out for. 

[MAX YEAR-W GME](https://preview.redd.it/jjb80nq61u761.png?width=1574&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f05b574464b81ac2fddadf862a9662468806d6d)

&#x200B;

If you made it this far, I applaud you because now you have made it to the point where I explain how I'm playing GME this week.

&#x200B;

Here is a 5d-15m chart of GME. On here you will see lots of lines and shit. These lines and shit have some meaning to it so just bear with me alright! If you already couldn't tell, these are my support and resistance zones. **The most important zone on here is going to be the purple zone which is $21.33-21.52** , which is also going to be my entry point if GME can make a clear break of that zone. Best way to put it, if it can clear $21.33, wE iS tO Da mOoN bABy 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

BUT HOLD YOUR FREAKING HORSES! if we fall below 20.02...we might be in for quite a steep drop as this $20 zone has been acting as a strong support level for the past week. If it makes a clean break of support, we'll probably fall back to $18.75...if it can't hold that? 15.80 again and we'll have to start this awful process all over again. I am extremely bullish on GME so I am not too worried that GME is going to fall under $20, but it is always good to have a back up plan, ya neva kno:/

[5D 15M](https://preview.redd.it/360ozr3d4u761.png?width=1564&format=png&auto=webp&s=db253aab5d46797a9b68b3ace6f85e4f554ea084)

&#x200B;

To wrap this long and boring TA up. I am not entering until GME can clear $21.33, if it breaks this zone with a lot of volume... mark my words fellow autists, **WE WILL SQUEEZE UP TO 32.80 BABY**  🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 *(refer to red zone on first chart to see why 32.80 is my first price target)*

**TLDR:**

$22c 1/15/21

$25c 1/29/21

$30c 2/19/21



UPDATE: I am making this edit for anyone who may be concerned about GME today, I am still very much confident that GME will burst this week and as for now I am still keeping my eye out for the 21.33 zone. As we know, it broke that resistance earlier and ran up a lot but the volume was just way too low and it wasn’t able hold. Long story short, I will be going in heavy if we can break the 21.33 zone with substantial volume. Keep faith fellow autists, ride this to the moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",2020-12-28 02:33:53

Making of Diamonds: What you need to be aware of going into this week for GME,0.96,"**Making of diamonds.**

**My Pt4 of DD is coming but I just want you guys to be aware of the following going into Monday December 28th.**

It is true that shorts have been bullying us left right and center. They’ve been pushing us around for months. They’ve been manipulating the stock to put downward pressure in every way they can.

I got so fuckin tired of those using money/power to push little guys around, it compelled me to write my very first Reddit post about a move a bully made to push GME down. Shoutout to u/The_Bossss for spotting their next move too.

&#x200B;

**But not every move of theirs sits in plain sight like this.**

* Ones who’ve been keeping an eye on the price action would know this but Oct/Nov: all those ‘sharp 5\~10% rise’ the first market hour followed by gradual decline throughout the day could have been them taking the steam out.

Think about it. After 20 days of you messaging your friends “oh shit GME is squeezing today!” you start to fall into “fuck it, I’m wrong again, GME will never squeeze.”

* It’s also VERY possible, that they are amongst us, selling us believable stories like “December 24th is going to squeeze because of A, B, and C.” and feed us believable bullshit to:

A) to create disappointment again/take the steam out of us or

B) to scalp us on options (honestly these posts could also be written by just straight up scumbags amongst us for this purpose). Options that were $0.01 $0.02 a couple days prior as a result were $0.10, $0.15. Doesn’t seem like much but we’re talking easy 10 baggers and 7.5 baggers for these scalpers.

C) They genuinely believe it, but you need to be aware of A and B and take it with a grain of salt.

* It is possible that they bought leading up to earnings/ran the price up, only to dump to set the ‘direction’ and cause a bigger sell-off utilizing the paper handedness of WSB. Yes, missing revenue was missed by 9.73% and that’s not good, but when their earnings are beaten by 38.5%, did it really warrant almost a 20% slide the next day?

Again, this was likely due to FOMO and disappointment, but I want you to be aware of the possibility.

&#x200B;

Similarly, they may have bought the past week only to cause a dip one of these days.

The moment you paperhand it, is the moment you accept defeat and let the bully have their way once again.

Look around you, you got a whole gang of people on this sub alone that will never let it get so bad. Our big brother Cohen will slap Melvin back to hibernation before you get seriously hurt.

Don’t turn your back and cry away just because you got bitchslapped. They are laughing at you as you walk to the corner to cry.

(This is where your and my interest conflicts because I just deposited more funds and I’m hoping for a dip so whatever you do is fine by me.)

**Don’t be fooled/read Seeking Alpha/Motley Fool articles likely paid off by Melvin Capital to be written that says GME may crash and burn or whatever because, on the contrary:**

* It is true that ICR now has GameStop under “Technology” now and it is true that Eli and Peyton Manning are doing a Q&A at 5:30pm, which is just after Gamestop’s presentation.   
**Important edit:** Mannings were scheduled well before Gamestop's schedule changed from the 13th to 11th. Mannings may not have anything to do with Gamestop. 

Maybe they’re going to announce a development of light weight/portable/budget friendly Omni directional treadmill? next generation gaming wearable? VR?

– look up OmniPad for example of light weight ones (these guys are working with Facebook now).I will talk about this in my Pt 4 DD but this is the future of gaming, e-sports even conferences/trade shows and even ZOOM calls (think room-like 'depth' so different conversations don't end up over-running each other). This would be HUGE.

* At the very least, just like how it has us guessing, it’s enough to make Melvin Capital’s head start spinning wondering if they should trim their position just in case.

They must have at the very least had an internal conflict/dialogue about their GME short position there by now.

They can start closing any day now. I personally wouldn't try to time this. It can easily mean the difference between 10x baggers and 6x baggers.

* It could also be possible that the ‘beef’ between Cohen and Sherman is not real.

Look at the wording of the letters, look at the changes that Gamestop has been making over the past few months on their website alone.

For all we know, the 'weaknesses' are shown just to keep the shorts piling. They could be working together. Who knows, Cohen and Sherman? might even share a common background.

* It is true that all shorts are under water currently and they are paying fees/interest on their position (I know this is so obvious/repeated many times, sorry)
* Ryan Cohen bought at $16.00. He’s not even sweating.

You gotta wonder, how did he come to 12.9%? Is that his max? is that all he’s got?

As u/ronoron pointed out, Cohen is not even fuckin sweating.He’s just trying to meme “OVER 9000” (holding 9,001,000 shares)

* You also have to understand that in the world of high level execs/finance (and even politics), people all somehow know each other/are connected in a way.

There is a criss cross web of connections. As much as they fuck us and swat at us like bugs, up there you can’t be so rash.

Cohen can’t just come to the scene and instantly make the squeeze happen. He’ll make enemies that way.

It has to be done in a way where he’s given so many warnings, given them so many exits along the way and made his intentions so clear all throughout.

Also, he’s Canadian so he’ll probably even say sorry as he makes the squeeze happen.

Source: I am Canadian and I am sorry for the long DDs.

**Armed with this information:**

You guys are not all delicate snowflakes anymore. You guys are all carbon atoms. Some of you guys who can take some heat will make out as carbon fibre, but those who can take the real heat and real pressure will make out as diamonds.

Remember, the squeeze is a war and the moment the Spartan 300’s marching shield formation is held, GME can see $300s.

I will get to the boring math stuff one day of how I got to $103 minimum squeeze price and $326 on the upper end. I know my DDs are long, but fuck I know for sure I’m gonna lose y'all on the math.

Seeing how you guys handled the last round of puts, I think it might even go higher but we shall see.

For those like me who had/have to build everything from $0 and never got any inheritance/financial help, the squeeze can be the greatest transfer of wealth you will ever experience. This time, you'd take from the bully.

**positions**:  Shares as well as options JAN 15 15C, 30C, APR 16 30C. GME makes majority of my port.

P.S I'm not picking any comment/message in particular to get to first. I will do my best to get to you all. Sorry for the delay.

Edit: Oh man. I don't know why but I put line breaks so the paragraphs don't look like blocks, it stays like that for some time, but it just gets re-edited to just blocks of text? What the heck is going on? Does anyone know how to fix this?

(Maybe) Dumb GME Question,0.92,"(Maybe) dumb question that I'm trying to understand. Melvin Capital has \~51,000 puts that cost $565 each based on u/uberkikz11's awesome research in his post the other day. Doesn't this equate to just a $28.8 million position? With downside limited to just that amount because they're puts?

Given Melvin has $7 billion in AUM, do they car about $28.8 million at all? Or even $100 million for that matter? In other words, if the stock is above their strike price of $24, wouldn't they just let the $28.8 million go and not need to actually buy any shares to cover?

EDIT: Also, (and I know this one is a dumb question, just trying to learn), if they shorted the stock, why would they be buying put options? Wouldn't they want call options to properly hedge?",2020-12-27 20:09:48

Why GME will continue crashing on Monday using Technical fundamentals. (Not enough retail to break the balance board.),0.17,"Now many people are confused about some past posts so I figured we need to go into the deep technical fundamentals on why people hoping for a ""rocket"" so called on Monday will be instead met with a continuing crash. let me break this down with 3 fundamental stock activity charts that focus on the last 5 days of GME trading activity below.

&#x200B;

[Technical charts showing stock activity, shows the rise, start of doom, and crash which will continue on Monday. Click to zoom in.](https://preview.redd.it/mtey1hnv7s761.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&s=618569d9fbfb1e252c6cbd62736bcd17bc2100fd)

**Now then, the dissection:**

1. **The first chart shows the full 5 days and what is called the ""balance board"" the balance board is usually a heavily resistant and stubborn point that if broken, usually leads to a massive spike that may have short or long duration. As you can see within the last 5 trading days of last week (today is Sunday so new week) even with inflated retail, fomoing, and a squeeze, GME could not break the balance board, and in fact declined as attempts to continue to fail.**
2. Also on image 1 is the clear visual of when the rocket took off, Dec 22nd. That's the end of the flt lower line on Image 1 before the spike up.
3. Image 2 points out the drop later on that week, showing that the big firms, hedges, and other rich conglomerates that control a significant portion of the market where starting to pull and retail and other smaller conglomerates were losing the ability to pump up the stock,
4. Finally in image number 3, on Thursday the last day of the week, the big firms, hedges, and rich conglomerates did not go in or pulled back leading to a crash, you can tell by the trajectory of the fall and the grey line (which is for after hours trading) that the amount of investment and pumping by retail and smaller conglomerates were not significantly less than before.
5. Expanding on point number 4 above, if you look at the after hours grey line, retail and others were still trying to push the stock up but because too much of the market controllers pulled back or/and stopped investing they were not able to not only keep up the pace from days before, but to bring back the GME stock into the green after hours.

**All the points above show that more big movers will pull or stall while retail and other smaller investor individuals and groups will lose the ability to move the stock higher**, it will keep crashing until some part of the bigger market movers jumps in to give a platform for all that retail pump to bounce off.

As you can see on chart 3 the trading activity of these individuals in groups did not drop, the only thing that dropped was big funding and big money either stalling or pulling the rug a bit. And look at how it crashed the stock, and how even with low volume during after hours retail still couldn't get the stock back up even back to the CLOSING LEVEL they failed.

We should prepare for a continuing crash on Monday and possibly a bigger major crash back into the low 10's or single digits later this week. Do not be fooled, no time has WSB continued a long fomo has it ever kept going up, there is no exception, get out and/or buy puts now. People were expecting the squeeze on Wednesday and Thursday, it came and couldn't break the balance board, and crashed on Thursday. People are forgetting about Thursdays crash and are hand waiving it as some temporary feet

***But there are no fundamentals or technical analysis to support this stock moving past the balance board***, and with no big major cash movers to help retail or smaller conglomerates move the stock, they can't move the stock by themselves, this just isn't possible. All you are doing is wasting money at this point until more major movers go into the stock, or stalled ones start investing again.

Hopefully the breakdown, and stock charts above will finally help people understand why you can't float something without support, or launch something without gas. What is the balloon floating on? If there's nothing there the balloon can't float, this is common sense.",2020-12-27 19:50:26

Why GME is going to the Moon (Compressed information + Links),0.96,"I'm keeping this as short as possible, with as much information as possible. I might go over some points, but this is what I consider most important. Let's go.

&#x200B;

***Some of the facts:***

\- We're at the start of a new console cycle, which historically has always lead to a massive spike in share price. Even with the price surge in the last few months, we're still less than 1/6th of what GME was priced at last console cycle. And it's only just begun.

\- 250% of outstanding share float is shorted [(as of Dec. 14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kkjidv/short_of_float_update_gme_the_short_squeeze_is/) This means that there are more short positions than actually shares outstanding, which would create a problem for the shorters, should there be a catalyst that moves the price upwards, [creating a short squeeze.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp)

\- Ryan Cohen, a 35 year old successful businessman, Billionaire, who self-admittedly only invests in companies he believes buys  a 9,98% stake in GameStop and has since increased it to 12,9%.

\- Ryan Cohen sends the BoD [a letter](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf) where he tells them all how unhappy he is with how things are going and that they should get their shit together. This is done BEFORE he increases his stake to 12,9%

\- GameStop has its Q3 earnings which aren't great, but not as bad as projected, their online sales are up over 250% YTY and they have an additional $300 million in their cash reserve ($600 million for a company who's market cap currently is just over $1 Billion). [Link to Q3 Transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/12/09/gamestop-gme-q3-2020-earnings-call-transcript/)

\- We learn that they're closing 1000 stores which are hurting their profit by Q1 of 2021 and are doing some rebranding work. [Stores Shutdown](https://bestlifeonline.com/gamestop-closing/) and [Rebranding](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k66w5h/gme_rebranding_in_progress_theyve_just_changed/)

\- RC Ventures files another 13D on December 22 where he discloses how he increased his stake above 10% to 12,9% with another message for the board ***""While the reporting persons desire to come to an amicable resolution with the issuer, the reporting persons will not hesitate to take any actions that they believe are necessary to protect the best interests of all stockholders.""*** [Link to 13D](https://fintel.io/doc/sec/1822844/000119380520001571/e620151_sc13da-gamestop.htm)

\- Investing research group Hedgeye pitches long-term potential for [GME with price target of ""$50+"".](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kiv44e/gme_target_50/)

&#x200B;

Now most of you should get a good idea why GME is a good bet short-term if you've read the above DD and do some logical thinking. There is also an argument to be made about the future potential it has, if Cohen does indeed turn the ship around and polish this into something magnificent. 

But you need some vision to see that, and I'm not trying to push you retards too much out of your comfort zone.

Smash that subscribe button and come back to reading (or ask a grown-up for help) these words.

As the semiliterate among you know, GameStop was scheduled to present on the last day of the ICR Conference on January 13th, under the retail category. GameStop analyst extraordinaire (I won't speaketh the naughty Eeking Salpha words, mods) Justin Doperiala at DOMO Capital caught this minor, yet massive tweak.

At some point in the last few days, GameStop was shifted from the Retail & Consumer category on the 13th to now present under the TECHNOLOGY category AH on Jan 11th. What does this mean? Management may not be-a-buncha-bitches after all. They clearly requested the category switch and have something TECHNOLOGY related to share. M&A? Strategic shift/review? DIGITAL FIRST OMNI-CHANNEL?!?

Now, #WeWantCohen and there's really nothing the boomers can say to change that. But what they can do, is speak boomerish in a way that the other market participants are made aware of the tech & e-commerce opportunity that has not been valued in any way by the market (yes, even at $20/share the stock is an easy 2-3x+ on fundamentals over 2021-2022). GameStop's tens of millions of unique customer profiles and decades deep dataset are truly unique in the massive gaming industry.

Melvin's put position was rolled to Jan21 (see here: [https://imgur.com/a/BGSxG91](https://imgur.com/a/BGSxG91)), and management surely knows this. Could they be competent after all? Yes. Now will Melvin bend over and take it? Doubtful. But don't believe the FUD. The upside opportunity and near term re-rating has been enhanced by Management's choice of the words TECHNOLOGY in this case.

TL;DR: DFV/RK is the man. GME is going much higher. I have thousands of shares and hundreds of ITM/ATM/OTM calls from Apr21 to Jan2023.

4. Institutions / hedge funds piling in last week

She told you your only purpose was to have ice packs ready for her thighs and bandaids for the scrapes on her knees? Yeah, well this is even more direct and serious. 

You have one purpose in this life. Fuck Melvin Capital and his bitch ass boys so hard that when they burp next Christmas, it smells like fresh semen. What that means for you paint sniffing crayon eaters is simple.

Nothing can get in our way. All the wet toilet paper cucks sold already, (ice packs and bandaids aren't cheap) and we know Christmas stamina makes their wives boyfriends even stronger. We can now impose some real autistic willpower into these shorter's souls.

Stop being so dense and retarded. Calls dated after Q1, everything else dickrammed into shares. I can't fucking read another post with some cuck crying about his weekly OTM calls expiring worthless, when he is actually supposed to be in his chair watching his wife get porked by her coworkers. Stop trying to tear your relationships apart and give them the attention they deserve. If your phone is out, you should be recording, not bitching about your stupid FD's. 

This shit is official. 

**SHARES AND CALLS DATED AFTER Q1**

Everyone that actually wants to make money instead of lose it, will already know this. 

Now go put your fucking medical helmets on, your mouth guards, anti-scratch gloves and prepare for the war of the fucking decade. If you have access to margin, credit cards, and student loans, don't be a degenerate retard who goes and buys weekly calls. Spend at least 200% of your net worth on shares and maybe you can go be someone's wife's boyfriend. Is that clear? The shorters are sweating and it's dripping down their ass crack. Take advantage of it and stop being a cock gobbler. 

TL;DR for you retards with the attention span of a paper bag. GME shares make rocket shoot up. With lube, rocket so slippery that it squeezes out of atmosphere. Literally can't do tit's up. Tit's up bad, GME squeeze up, good.

Edit 1: For the 10 of you that can actually read. Here is something I saw /u/Woodyoureally comment in another post. ""The SEC considers company directors, officials, or any individual with a stake of 10% or more in the company to be corporate insiders.""

""Insiders are prevented from buying and selling their company stock within a six-month period; therefore, insiders buy stock when they feel the company will perform well over the long-term.""

Is that a guarantee that RC's 13% can't be sold during the impending squeeze? Poor GME shorters. They will only be able to buy from us diamond handed retards and RH is going to crash when the squeeze starts anyways.

Great, steel futures are up yadayada and the steel bulls are gonna tell you a nice story, but is this steel price growth sustanainable for these stocks to make more good gains? Besides, things like MT, VALE, X, STLD are already in billions or tens of billions in Mkt Cap, with these inflated prices. Schnitzer is the only one that’s below 1B and still making modest gains.

So, I’m considering dumping all my VALE shares to add to my GME shares. That is all. Tell me why this is a stupid idea.

Autism in the movies - a retard's watchlist for the holidays,0.86,"I'm sure we all got some time off from Wendy's for the holidays and it's not like we're ever going to read a fucking book, so here's a little watchlist of movies/show based around Wall Street and finance for you retards, inspired by a comment on the daily.

I've seen pretty much all of them so hopefully you guys will make some suggestions too and I'll edit to add them.

# The classics

(I'm including those just so you won't spam the comments)

* **Wall Street** (and the shitty sequel)
* **The Wolf of Wall Street** \- Yeah you've seen it 10 times while pretending to jack off to Margot Robbie when you were really thinking about Jonah Hill
* **The Big Short** \- OG autistic action, I guess 🌈🐻s get a pass for this one

# Movies

* **Trading Places** \- What if WSB was around in the 80s? Two autist millionaires try to find out
* **Rogue Trader** \- A retard who would feel right at home here manages a new trading desk with 0 oversight. I think we can all relate. Based on the real story of Nick Leeson (or is it 1ronyman?) which is worth a read, but watch the movie first or it'll spoil the ending.
* **Boiler Room** \- Jesse Pinkman goes STONKS, BITCH and Vin Diesel doesn't blow shit up (except his clients accounts)
* **Margin Call** \- Those suck right? It's like that but for a whole investment bank during the 2008 crisis.
* **Barbarians at the Gates** \- Haven't seen this but it's about a guy trying to buy his own company. Probably a good watch for the week-end to get excited about incoming GME tendies

# Documentaries

* **Million dollar traders** \- They give random retards and a boomer a 2-week seminar and $1MM to trade, then proceed to manage them as loosely as possible. Somehow they don't all end up homeless. Can anyone become a trader? Apparently not a successful one, but you knew that already.
* **Floored** \- Before RobinHood, retards had to congregate in a pit and scream orders at each other. A nostalgic look at what it was and how it's now on life-support thanks to boomers who can't computer
* **Betting on Zero** \- Haven't seen this yet but it stars Bill SPACkman so you know it's gonna be good.
* **The China Hustle** \- Before SPACs of shitty Chinese companies were all the rage, reverse-mergers of total dogshit Chinese companies were the best way to throw money away with no idea of what's going on. Pretty eye-opening on the practices of Chinese companies before they all stopped of course, now they're 100% legit trust me blo.
* **Wall Street Warriors** \- Some are retards, some are autists, but somehow they all make money in finance, sometimes doing the stupidest shit. Shoutout to the jackass trading from home in his robe, I think we can all relate
* I'm excluding all the docs about the GFC, the fed, etc because we know the story: printer go brrr, banks yolo, 🌈🐻s make money for once, yada yada yada

# TV Shows

* **Industry** \- Autists with actual degrees start as trainees in the City. It's kind of weird and Bri'ish and they fuck a lot, but it's all about people on the actual trading floor which is kinda cool. New this year so there's only like 8 episodes.
* **Billions** \- I hesitate to put this here because it's more about politics and personal power-plays, but the main guy runs a hedge fund and a lot of the early seasons centers around that, plus he's rich and a dick about it so I automatically like him. And the other side will make you say ""fuck the feds"" which is true, fuck the feds.",2020-12-25 22:01:23

First yearly christmas gains/loss Post!,0.56,"Screenshot for proof:
https://i.ibb.co/NxvFp6w/Screenshot-20201225-164433-01.jpg


Oh my fellow retards and autists, how much I had doubted your ways before you converted me! Just like GME I'm only getting started in Q4 of this year; as my positions clearly show I started right at the end of this week.


So this time of the year is the proper time to start new traditions, here's mine for this year. I'll post my stats for the year with the corresponding proof, laying out the highs and lows, talk shit about all those who doubted me or post some loss porn for you fuckers getting off to it. 


This year doesn't have much to show since I've only recently been converted. But so far the last two months have gained over 17% which is nothing to the craisziness you retards post regularly, but it's enough to put a smile on my face!


I had started with 'optimally' levaraged ETFs and TSLA stocks (until my broker no longer offered levaraged TSLA long). I went full retard starting 30th of april and bought GME at the top for 19$, then went on to sell everything I could, maxed out my credit cards and left barely enough to pay the next rent into GME. This brought my average down to 17.02$ right before ER. I took out about 600$ to convert it into calls but the transaction still needs to go through.


So unless I manage to lose everything YOLOing it into something retarded I plan on upping this to at least 40k next year. I could pay off all debts and have 20k left to gamble in 2022. 


So merry christmas you retards, I hope you have some nice and crispy tendies next year!",2020-12-25 19:55:21
"Quick! You've caught a case of the ""Paper Hands!""",0.89,"Hello there, Merry  🎄 Christmas!  It seems you've been making plays based off of /r/wallstreetbets top posts, but you always buy at the top and sell when it drops! You may have a intermediate case of the mysterious paper hands. Don't worry though, this holiday season can still be reversed if you've lost all of your gains to to $BABA weeklies, take a look below and allow me to introduce myself.

I'm dopydon, $GME trading mastermind, who can easily fix all of your horrendous day trades. There's a simple step by step solution to get you back on track, retard!

Step 1. Self diagnose yourself with paper hands, admitting you have a problem is the first part of finding a fix.

Step 2. Find a specific stock and stick to it. $GME offers a lot of upside with heavily researched DD, but your dumbass thought that about $PLTR and you still managed to fuck it up! Your dumb as hell! That's okay, things will be different this time, or so you tell yourself.

Step 3. Now that you have 200 GME shares, just wait. Literally do nothing. The money is free, and if you do this, not only can you get rid of paper hands, but you can starting to develop your trading prowess through diamond 💎 hands! That's a whole other post, stay tuned.

So you go out Monday, and put your whole $750 account into the stock, and I'll only be asking for a 50% helpers fee off of any of the monstrous gains you collect!

Why $GME can still pop next week,0.78,"Yes yes I know, the big squeeze theory that pervades every game stop post, but there's some real DD behind it (thanks u/rustincoh1e)

$GME is currently trading at $20.15. There are 100M shares outstanding and a short interest of 68M. Momentum slowed down a lot after Tuesday, but the price is holding above $20. These short positions were opened before the RC news, when the price was between $13 - $16. This means that unless the price falls back down below those levels, they'll have to pay a fine, which Is something like 20% + the price of buyback to hold the positions. But seeing as prices have been holding above $20 and news has all been positive since RC increased his stake, I don't see a nearly 50% drop happening soon. That's not to say they'll all cover, there were huge put orders right when the price started dropping, which could mean that institutions are trying to recoup losses through options.

**<h2>BUT</h2>**

Even if 10% of those shares outstanding decided to cover next week, that's an additional 7M shares in demand. Recent volumes have been around 10M per day (not counting big news days). With almost a twice as many shares in demand as usual, we should expect to see some kind of pop. Maybe not a 300% short squeeze like,  but I wouldn't be surprised if it hit $25 next week. 

Am I trying to hype myself up after being down 30% on 12/31 25c I bought at the ATH? You bet your sweet assets I am. Do I think it might actually happen? Maybe if enough of you 💎 ✋ the shit out of this on Monday. 

**tl;dr: hold onto $GME for your God damn lives and we can all get rich. Prove me wrong. 

Seriously, prove me wrong, I'm tryna get better at DD. Constructive criticism only, my hands are diamonds but my feelings are toilet paper.**

🚀Christmas Miracle / GamerGate 2020: GME shorts negotiating with PE/IBs to unwind their shorts 🚀,0.97,"I was reading Uberkikz11 twitter (one of the first guys to talk about GME on here / think the Michael J Burry of GamerGate) to get more DD, and then I saw it: https://gfycat.com/anchoredimpishfishingcat-ving-rhames

Some guy tweeted this to Uberkikz11 and nobody is talking about it:

https://twitter.com/KjetillStjerne/status/1342347744875327488/photo/1

Direct link to his ""DD"" screenshot:

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EqD6GpJWMAAHehj?format=jpg&name=large

Who is this guy?: I have no fucking idea.

Where did he get it?: I have no idea, hoping someone in the comments can tell us.

What's he saying?: I transcribed part using my shitty OCR app, there may be errors so it's better to read the screenshot but here you go because you're too lazy:

>Right now there are some aggressive negotiations happening behind the scenes between several of the large short positions and some private equity / investment banks (PE/IBs) which will remain unnamed. The chatter going around is that the PE lb syndicate is offering two options. Option 1 is for the shorts to give highly discounted shares they hold of other stocks in exchange for shares of GME stock held by the PE lb side. This will allow the short positions to start to unwind their situation without getting completely destroyed having to source shares from the open market. Option 2 is to allow the large shorts to purchase tranches of GME from $35 to $80 in a private auction that will swap on an ATS and get reported over a series of weeks to minimize price impact. 

>However, things are not progressing well as the discussions have been going on for several months. So, Option 3 is the nuclear option and the reality of it occurring is increasing daily. A few of the head traders have indicated patience is waning and the short squeeze opportunity is just too good to pass up at this point. 

>And this is what brings us to Option 3. Option 3 is for PE/IB to suspend discussions with the shorts and begin accumulation. In fact, large quantities of Calls with strikes from $23 to $35 have been quietly accumulated via small lot buys in all expiry series out to 20 January 2023 and remain as open interest. Next step is analysts initiating new coverage on GameStop discussing how the company is turning things around post-COVID. ""Management closed the right stores and properly restructured. The remaining stores can act as micro-distribution centers with GameStop transitioning to a hybrid format e-commerce business. It appears they are taking the best of Amazon (online) and Best Buy (brick & mortar). We see great things ahead for GameStop."" This is the narrative that will be launched at the right time to drive retail buying and to trigger passive management ETF buying. Then, PE/lBs will dive in with significant open market purchases to lock the float.

GME YOLO Christmas update — Dec 25 2020,0.99,,2020-12-25 15:10:08
Let’s get serious about GME,0.76,"Let me preface this post by saying over half of my portfolio is in GME. I believe in the company, and think they could make a comeback within the next year. I understand the whole Xbox and PS5 fiasco will gain them plentiful profits, and they are a main source of games for a lot of people without access to online stores and the like around the globe, but I have some doubts. 

Cohen was a great pump. He raised moral regarding the stock and reinstated a lot of people’s faith in the company. If he were to do a full on hostile takeover this could go really, really well. 

However, there are many alternative situations we could find ourselves in. What if he’s just being an evil cuck and plans to pump and dump this rally? What if he just decides he isn’t into the idea anymore and bails? 

Furthermore, sure GameStops obvious next move is gaming e-commerce, but with Origin, Epic, Steam and more, there are already too many online gaming platforms at this point in my opinion. Perhaps they’ll mean to move into primarily shipping physical copies? Even then, why wouldn’t I simply order a game off Amazon?

Like I said, I’m all for GameStop as a stock, fuck a gay ass bear, and GME to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 but there may be more that needs to be discussed here.

It's still premarket, you know it doesn't mean shit most of the time but you do it every day anyway. Once again it's a -0.5% day.  You notice a hit piece from SeekingAlpha written by Mott Capital, you don't know what it's saying since you can't read, but somehow you know the author is a gay bear. Then you go on StockTwits, ShyGlizzy is ""shorting here"" again but you know learned to ignore all the bears. You hide your feeling of discomfort for now.

It's now been 3 days since you bought GME 40C, and every day you keep losing to theta gang. You bought at 300% IV and there's 2 days until expiration. You're staring at a 95% loss, and you're about to paperhand, but you don't because you know u/deepfuckingvalue is still fucking in at a gain of over 9 million. You unzip your pants and start jerking off to his gain porn. You start at 7:28 and finish just in time before the market opens.

Robinhood crashes again and you can't log in, you start feeling a sense of panic rising through the depth of your innards. You take a double dose of Prozac and Xanax and from $PFE, you asked your doctor for this since you also have $PFE 60c expiring in 2 weeks. But it's not helping and you feel your hands turn into toilet paper.

But wait... what's going on ? $GME on investing.com is showing a price of $42.69?!?!? You think you're dreaming so you refresh... now it's $69... another 5 minutes... no updates. You go on r/wallstreetbets and you see the daily thread comment has over 30k comments. GME triggered circuit breaker and its stopped trading, and it's now mooning 100% every time it resumes trading

You notice your PP fully erect at over 3 inches, you haven't felt this way since you have ED from all the Prozac you've been taking ever since you started options trading. $GME is now over $9000 dollars per share, u/deepfuckingvalue is now banging McKenzie Scott (formerly known as McKenzie Bezos) and starts a hostile take over of $AMZN. While u/Sir_jack_a_lot  dies from a ruptured brain aneurysm due to hypertension from too many tendies.  The WSB collective now starts a hedge fund, creating $RTRD ETF comprised solely of GME and TSLA calls. Bears around the world are annihilated while shares of $KMB and $JNJ rallies over 30% on reports of a sudden increase in demand for kleenex and personal lubricants.

and that was the greatest day of your life, and it's great because you didn't paperhand.

I was invested in GME and I sold off at about 20$ just to ride the train and I was considering dumping a few K in it but upon considering it a potential short term gain, I can't see the long term future for gamestop (and the stock market is future looking.... as you see with these insane EV plays).
First some points to consider - I'm not going to explain them all because you are all intelligent enough:

-PC Gaming (how did this evolve) 
-DVD/Blu Ray Sales (growth trends) 
-XBox Game Pass 
-Stadia 
-Mobile Gaming 
-Current Trends in YoY Physical/Digital Video Game Trends
 -Cheaper Storage on devices (SSD, external drives etc...) 
-Better Internet Service (starlink, fibre installations etc...) 
-Facebook Marketplace/Kijiji/Craigslist -The Giants (Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart etc....) 
-Chewy selling undigitiseable goods 
-Ryan Cohen is a one hit wonder? 
-Blockbuster 
-HMV

The Short Squeeze Theory 
If any catalyst was the short squeeze, its RC's increased position in GME. That generated 30% gains. If a 30% gain is not enough to trigger a short squeeze, then what is? This is the second 30% gain recently - I guess the Oct 8, Microsoft announcement was the first. 

How does Gamestop have a rosy future, 
where is its niche? 

The only thing I can thing of that would be an epic play would be drone video game delivery. They have so many locations they can have a video game delivered by drone . A combination of super fast video game delivery and making a central video game console system à la steam is the only real way forward. Everything else is a distraction. Drones, Boardgames and video games hardware accessories might have a spot, however this would take a very motivated workforce.

I'm not saying its not undervalued even today and could be even a win short term but all signs and historical examples point to decline.",2020-12-25 00:35:21

Again, squeeze hasn't even begun and won't for awhile but who cares stock prices keep climbing the shorts (Melvin Capital) are getting killed.

Don't get fooled by the shorts/gay bears telling you it squeezed and shorts got out, they said the same thing pre earnings after the run up. As you can see from the SI, nope in fact it went up. How can I tell it short squeezed? When I get consecutive days of trading halts because Melvin Capital are trying to exit GME a stock with very low volume.

Complaining about their revenue during a pandemic (the majority of sales still come from brick and mortar, physical stores) when all their stores are forced to closed during the end of a god damn console super cycle is retarded.

GME DD fresh perspectives Pt 3 Future of Gamestop + Squeeze teaser. Christmas Edition.,0.97,"Guys, I’m sorry I did not do a good job at painting the picture yesterday. I was pretty tired from a 4 hour hike and I really wanted to put it up earlier than later so more people would be exposed to it.

A lot of what I wanted to deliver got lost in the ‘Amazon vs GME’. I see it myself. Thank you to all that offered constructive criticism.

**\*\*If you still worry that Gamestop might go back down to $16.00, I invite you to take a few minutes to read this as this would put the concern to rest. This DD is a bit longer, but I am VERY confident in what I'm laying down below.\*\***🚀

Here we go:

**The Future of Gamestop/PowerUP**

**How many of you guys have one of these? Phones, GoPro, drones, VR gear, tablets, gimbal stabilizer?**

Of those who answered yes which would be everyone, how many of you did one of these with the old device when you upgraded?

A) Sold it on eBay and hoped to god every day you don’t get scammed until they could no longer open a case against you or pray USPS doesn’t lose the item or get delayed and have the buyer open a return/case as a result.

B) Sold it on Craigslist/Facebook/Kijiji and dealt with time wasters/low ballers/no-shows blowing up your phone which could only made you look popular in front of your crush only to finally have someone show up to offer you $50.00 less than your price which you clearly stated was a FIRM price because of a scratch you mentioned in the ad was ‘worse than they thought’ or that’s just all they had.

C) Gave it to a friend/relative/stash it in your drawer because you can’t be bothered with A or B

D) (Phones only) Don’t really love your friends/relatives as much as you love what you can do with the cash/they don’t want it more than you want the cash but don’t want to deal with A or B so you just took a lowball offer At&T, Verizon…etc gave you which was easily $100\~200 below the fair market price?

**How many of you guys are ok with buying one of those devices used but you ultimately end up buying new because of:**

A) Getting scammed, buying a fake device/something being broken… etc etc

B) You can’t be bothered to deal with sellers who are not honest in their description.

C) The ideal unicorn seller is too far away.

**Can you relate? Of course you can.**

One day you buy a 1080P drone, next year they come out with 2.7K, next year they come out with 4K, year after that they come out with a 4K that fits in your pocket, and you can’t help but feel like you are just living in the past, or at least, left feeling like you are holding the bag like you bought PLTR at $29.

I have some of those devices, and I end up upgrading AT LEAST one of them every 1\~2.5 years just like you.

* Wouldn’t it be nice if there was a place nearby that you can just go to get a fair value for your trade in (maybe $50 less than you could get online but you don’t have to waste any time)?
* Wouldn’t it be nice if there was a brick and mortar place nearby you can count on that can’t just change their number/disappear tomorrow, have the ability to deliver your order to you in 1 hour AND offer returns AND offer 90 days warranty? What? I can buy extended warranty too?
* If there was one, and you just had to pay $50 on top of what you could find them for online otherwise, would you really bother with anything else? Would anyone?

**Don’t think about Gamestop for a second and be honest with yourself. If you answered yes to all 3, upvote this post. If you answered no to any of the above, just give it some time. You just haven’t experienced the inconvenience/pain yet.**

Ok, I get your point but there is no one that can offer something like this. Not **yet.**

Look, I know back in our days, Gamestop is where you went to get hustled but that’s going to change 180.’ Gamestop will change its name to “PowerUp” to be relevant in the broader consumer electronics field while retaining its gaming foundation.

So Ryan Cohen showed you guys that he’s serious about buying Gamestop upping his stake recently. It also said in 13D that he will do whatever is in the shareholders’ best interest. There was no new 13D posted today. **Meaning? The price rise was organic this week. Not from him buying. Shorts shook you a couple of times. You guys held. You guys did very good.**

Have you ever looked into what Chewy does in terms of customer service? Have you read up anything about Ryan Cohen to see what he/his father stands/stood for when it comes to customer experience? They are about selling goods that will make the customer the most happy not selling stuff that makes the most profit, funny enough, profit follows when you give customers what would make them the most happy and you end up making the most profit anyways. I speak from experience.

What made Bezos so successful is his focus on customer experience also. All entrepreneurs out there, please remember my spiel about customer experience at least. It’s the realest thing I or anyone can tell you. Do not ever fight with customers. Kill them with kindness if anything.

I bet you my last dollar this is what Cohen sees in Gamestop. The locations, the brand presence, 55M PowerUp members many of whom are already cultured on going through Gamestop’s revolving door because you get more store credit than cash and you are just accustomed to it.

**But c’mon man $50? How is the company going to make any money?** Look at the spread between bid and ask. It’s $50 each way from the mid-price (fair market price). That’s $100.00 profit for the company.

Still, only $100.00? Yeah, that’s actually 2X what they make off of console sales.

Every one of you, I know you said yes to my questions above, so do the math, upgrading at least one of the devices every 1\~2.5 years. Under this vision, it will be like 10 new consoles are being released every year for Gamestop AT LEAST. It will AT LEAST outdo BestBuy 26.55B market cap. Meaning Gamestop will do at least 20X within the next 5 years.

**“Yeah but Amazon sells used too? Didn’t you see?”**

Not like this. Used items on Amazon is more like buying stuff on eBay. Often relying on the seller’s description and the seller’s shipping. Can you drop your item off to Amazon and get cash? No

Imagine, the items are accurately described, it arrives in 1 hour via Doordash/Uber eats and there is no fuss no muss.

Then, after you bought the device, they just do this 1 simple thing.

1 week after you bought the thing they send you a text

*“Hey Autist, just wanted to check in, how’s your new dildo flexing so far? It’s gwon? Iight, good to hear. We are here if you have any questions/concerns. Have a nice day”*

Cohen will do at least this. I guarantee you, except he will add some more personal/relatable touch like “the 4K 69 Mega Pixel camera on that bitch really is something else huh?” As a cherry on top, there it is, one thing we can’t mistake for anything else. A FUCKIN ROCKET EMOJI at the end of the message. Wouldn’t you feel loved?  🚀

**Oh yeah, add this to the books.** With millions of us retail WSB autists holding GME, think about what that does for the PR when the squeeze happens and it WILL HAPPEN because $16 is where all the shorts are under water, and we ARE NEVER going below that. They’re paying fees right now and they will eventually cover. It will do wonders for the business' image.

Good chance the squeeze will happen like Tesla’s, 4X+ ing over a couple of months as they start to prove their vision and show that they are there to stay. (Source A). This is the bare minimum (or bear minimum). GME squeeze set up is a lot more potent but 'slowly but surely' is how it typically squeezes against diamond hands, diamond balls institutional shorts. 10X+++ ing as they bring their vision to reality.

&#x200B;

[See October 19 to Feb 20](https://preview.redd.it/zag3ukfz57761.jpg?width=959&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba0b9ad0b7878c5f6fd49829d2fe16e719320ee4)

That is of course, unless Cohen was just waiting for the new year for tax purposes to acquire more and announce that “oh yeah guys, I actually have enough options, shares now to buy the company”

He rides the squeeze, sell 25% shares, profit from that alone will pay for the business acquisition when it comes back down to its value as it is today of around $40 before heading to outdo BestBuy as I mentioned before (20X, that's $400/share in 5 years -being conservative, it can happen in less time🚀🚀🚀). The positive profit they would MOST CERTAINLY generate from this console cycle will more than pay for the restructuring. He still remains a major shareholder with 25%. His best interest will always be scaling GME.

Sherman for example, he owns 2% Bezos owns a little over 10%

**Do you want to think really long term?**

YouTube knew from Day 1 they were going to put ads one day, but they wanted to make it as sweet as possible for it to be engrained in you first – think video, think Youtube.

The day will come, think upgrading your device, whether it is new or used, think **PowerUP (more suitable name than Gamestop while retaining the gaming image)**

My point is, that they can increase the $100 spread if they wanted to, once it's habitual for us to make the sale/trade/purchase of a consumer electronics device at PowerUP as it is for us to order something on Amazon right now. For devices that are less liquid like computers/laptops the spread will likely be bigger from the start of course.That's only if you are still so hung up on making only $100/device because I, a nobody without a store/reputation could easily run around myself and flip 20 devices/week. Try it. Consumer electronics in a high population density areas are SUPER LIQUID. Remember Gamestop is everywhere dense population is (not talking the smooth brain kind of dense here)

How about this? When you bring your trade in, you get only $50 less than the classifieds’ resale value when you take store credit, but if you want cash, we can only give you $75 less than the classifieds’ resale value and vice versa. There, I just made the spread 50% more, $150 profit/device for Gamestop, and I made you more likely to return. Happy?

Bezos knew he wasn’t going to sell just books down the road.  
Elon Musk knew he wasn’t signing up to build just cars.  
Savvy business people that can build billion dollar business from scratch like Ryan, Elon and Bezos can anticipate moves years down the road.

The sky is the limit.

**We are just at the beginning, and I'm not done yet.You think I'm out to lunch? They're already getting started in the broader consumer electronics field (as mentioned in Pt2 of my DD). If you really can't relate, it's ok, it's probably because you are deep in #1 (as mentioned in Pt1 of my DD)**

My position:  Shares as well as options JAN 15 15C, 30C, APR 16 30C. GME makes majority of my port.

P.S :

Ryan, if you are reading this. I know you see the picture because it's the obvious picture. I’m in the space, and you’re right on the money in regards to the things you preach and do in regards to customer service/customer experience. I got some ideas brainstormed from writing these DDs I can offer (not asking for anything). I can see where you can save in shipping between stores, how the listing ‘system’ can be so all employees can take pictures and describe the items with consistency like how all McDonalds employees can make burgers with consistency… etc etc just to start. Feel free to reach out to me.No? Ok, you will compete with me a few years down the road. Just kidding.

**To all you guys & Ryan. Happy Holidays/Merry Christmas.Wishing you and your family nothing but the best this holiday season, yours truly**

**- Dildoflexing (You can call me Greendildoflexing when it squeezes)**

"Hello $BABA holders, please don't $ROPE",0.91,"I am Chinese, or used to be years ago at least by nationality. I am not going to post Chinese news article detailing the entire power struggle, just English. I mean, you monkeys can't read moon runes.

You see, the power struggle has been happening since Alibaba and Jack Ma became the ecommerce god of China, like Jeff ""the bald Grinch"" Bezos did with Amazon in America. China are commies, worshipping anyone but the party is illegal. That is why despite the profits and everything else, they are still sitting at 300+ and not flying like AMZN. Chinese know the power struggles all to well, smart ones will avoid it like plague. Not even Chinese boomers are touching it.

https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Mystery-video-suggests-power-struggle-in-China

The previous power struggles resulted in Ma forced out of CEO position in 2018, cue lip service to western friends who don't give a fuck just to make sure BABA don't drop. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/10/18/alibabas-jack-ma-spent-10-years-preparing-for-his-retirement.html

But like anyone who had felt the power trip of being the richest and most powerful man before, Ma could not stay retired and out of the limelight for long.

So he came out of retirement with the biggest fintech IPO in Asia, Ant Group. Now, that really pisses the Emperor off. Recognising his efforts in revolutionalizing ecommerse, Emperor Xi decided to let him spend the rest of his life in retirement... like a charity case. Yet he decides to step in limelight again, and overshadow the most ~~paranoid and insecure~~ powerful man in all of China?! Well Emperor is the party and party is the Emperor, now Emperor finally decides that you must be removed. Especially when they are showing the entire China the power and money capitalism brings. Cue CCP vs CEO power struggle round 2, except this time they are clashing in the open.

""Wait so why western crowds don't know???""

Uh you retards know you don't read right?

So what happens?

Buy the dip??

Cut losses and run???

Answer is simple:

If you are holding stocks then just keep holding it. BABA isn't going anywhere, they are the ecommerce monopoly along with Tencent in almost the entire Asia. The dip will not stop until power struggle turmoil is over, it will get even uglier over the months as Politburo falsify more charges to threaten the CEOs to back down.

Recover your call losses with puts, it really is that easy.

I have no options in it because I hate commies and know how they work. So until there is a clear winner in the power struggle, I am not gonna be a bad retard. If you want to listen, cool. If you think it's the dip you were waiting for, good luck with welfare because I tried. Then again I YOLO 50k each on GME and PLTR so what do I know? 🚀",2020-12-24 16:53:03

Real question about GME valuation,0.93,"Let’s forget the rockets and gay bears for a minute and have a discussion about fair value of the company here.

I see 4 potential scenarios:
1. Cohen pulls off a hostile takeover, infinity squeeze, rocket rocket, pew pew, how high does it go?
2. Cohen’s vision comes to fruition (whether he is involved or not) shorts cover, price stabilizes, balance is restored.
3. The company does enough to stay alive, uses the console cycle profits to pivot in the direction of online gaming, they lean out, but it happens at slow boomer speed.
4. Cohen executes an epic rug pull and takes his profits and moves on to the next adventure.

Regardless of how likely you may think any of these scenarios are a fair value has to be assessed.  Now I don’t really give a shit about scenario 1 or 4. What I care about is what a fair value of the company is in scenario 2 and 3 two years from now.. Given the balance sheet, increased gaming revenue expected in the coming years, and GameStop’s ability (or inability) to address the market what say you?

To get things started:
Scenario 2 - 4 Billion market cap
Scenario 3 - 1.5 billion market cap

TLDR: rockets and shit...maybe",2020-12-24 16:06:25

-Vaccines (while slower than expected) are ramping up exponentially. People will be going back to work and kids desperate to leave the fucking house will be getting their cars and moving about for the first time in a year. You’ll see the benefit of the pop in drivers (premium) without the crashes they’ll bring in the next 6 months. 

-As my previous post explains, less people on the road have resulted in significantly less claims. Progressive made bank on people who didn’t wanna cancel their registration (no insurance means your registration gets canceled) so they stayed at home with their cars. 

-Earnings is 1/27. The 2/19 play will cover this if a swing trade doesn’t hit. Do NOT play Jan 15th to save money on shorter calls. 

-Last year in the same Dec to Feb time period it gained **8 dollars**. This environment of undriven cars and a light winter (with less drivers getting stuck everywhere) has potential to crush that gain.

Then I bitterly doubled down on a retarded theory that it would crash again and I could catch the second wave.  Bitter and anxious how I would recover from my retarded decisions I decided to started looking for a place to learn how to be a more informed trader, how to find the right stocks, how to not be a retard.

Then I found you guys! Around September of this year I started over with my 6k and decided fuck it i got nothing to lose 6k is a few nice meals or a months worth of bills...  Discovering my true retard nature and a loving community of fellow retards has allowed me to take 6k and turn it into 100k in the last 4 months.  SO from the bottom of my retarded heart - Thank you to everyone on this sub for laughing at me, teaching me, and forcing me to be a better retard in the stock market than I would have ever been without you guys- Merry Christmas Retards!

**So to my prayer; :P**

Dear lord [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepFuckingValue/) ,

Please forgive me for my faith has waivered as I watch my tendies pile up and the temptation to sell is ever present. 6k to 50k to 100k,  Yae though I walk through the valley of gay bears, and paper hands - I shall fear no dip, for RC, GME Gang, and thou art with me.  Thy updates that ye are still with us re-affirms my diamond hands, and comforts my anxious water head. Thou anoited us with DD; and my cup runneth over. GME to the Moon, Fuck the gay bears, rocket kids pile in we are going to mars

In your heavenly name I pray!

My gift to you - a list of things you can do to stop losing all your fucking money.,0.94,"I realize none of you actually care about making money, but on the off chance I can help one person then this post will be worth it. I have a list of rules I follow when I take positions, and I think you might find some value if you have a similar list.

1. **Always trade to the long side - do not short.** There is an underlying elevating factor to the stock market - ""stocks only go up."" Although this is a meme, it's actually true. This means all bearish positions are fighting gravity by default. Go long, or go home.
2. **Pick a basket of individual stocks - at least 4 or 5.** If you have an 80% winning strategy, that means your basket will mostly win. If you have an 80% winning strategy and pick a loser, you're fucked. You work hard for your money, so don't fucking insult yourself by losing it you degenerate. Respect yourself and your money and stop giving it to theta goons.
3. **Only go long in an individual stock once you have a list of conditions**. Here are some of my conditions, and they usually work when I swing trade, as an example:
   1. The stock is currently trading above the 180 day SMA.
   2. The stock has a golden cross on the MACD.
   3. The stock has a candle close above the 9 day SMA.
   4. The day you enter in the position cannot be a new high.
   5. Never hold through earnings.

These are all elevating factors. **To illustrate this point**, look at RAD over the past few weeks:

**10/9/20**, you had most of these confirmation points. The trade went flat and you likely would have sold the very next day at a minor loss. I look stupid, right?

But, look at **11/3/20** \- All of the elements listed above (**Except for #1**) are met, and the stock rallies hard. You could take this trade, but I like to have all my indicators met before I move.

Then, on **12/2/20** RAD crosses the 180 day SMA (so all elements are met), and rallies again. This is where someone like me comes in.

**Look at GME:** Yesterday it held above the 180 day SMA, it closed above the 9 day SMA, it had a golden cross, and it doesn't release earnings until March, so you can hold it for a while. You could have seen confirmation yesterday, bought in, and sold out today with a 5% gain. 

**I'm not telling you to copy what I do. I'm just trying to give you a basic, understandable, introduction to some simple technical indicators so you don't get burned.** Or at least, you get burned less frequently.

**Also, final point: #4**. **Have a plan and stick to it.** Do you know why you have paper hands? Because you do not have a plan. There are lots of strategies online. There are people who only trade 3 bar plays. There are people who trade breakouts. There are people who trade on RSI. I don't care which one you use - just pick one and start making money. The sooner you have a plan, the sooner you will be able to get diamond hands because you'll know when you should enter and exit your positions.

**Honorable mention:**

[Tradingview.com](https://Tradingview.com). Check it out - it's charting software in the browser. **It's powerful and it's free.** I had no idea this was a thing until a few months ago. Changed my life and made screening so so so much easier.

That's it. I hope this helped at least one of you guys not throw your Christmas money into the pockets of someone else. Merry Christmas.",2020-12-24 03:22:16

Why GME could squeeze as early as tomorrow,0.94,"Came across noise that GME has been on the reg sho threshold list for almost 13 consecutive trading days so I  decided to do some digging and boy did I find something interesting. So interesting that I dare predict a short squeeze could happen as early as tomorrow. The magnitude of the squeeze is something that will be hard to tell, and could be dependent on factors currently unknown to us, but it will definitely be an early christmas present for many.

**What does it mean to be listed on the threshold list and what happens on the 13th consecutive day?**

The Regulation SHO Threshold Security List was created by the SEC in 2005 to reduce naked short selling. Stocks appear on this list when at least 0.5% of shares outstanding failed to be settled for 5 consecutive days or more. If a stock is on the list for 13 consecutive trading days, participants will be forced to close any settlement failures (a.k.a cover the naked shorts).

**Is GME on the threshold list?**

You bet. 12 consecutive trading days starting from 8th December 2020. Quick maths mean the 13th consecutive day would fall on 24th December 2020. Shorts will be forced to cover tomorrow basically.

https://preview.redd.it/wm6n09bbs1761.png?width=1145&format=png&auto=webp&s=552c76e3fdf51d81989e7021f53316385030a4ad

**Has this happened before?**

Yes. 12 consecutive days starting from 22 September 2020. Quick maths mean the 13th consecutive day fell on 8th October 2020.

https://preview.redd.it/6r3d53lvs1761.png?width=1111&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a9f42ae5235bbee1b1044b42f8ce5fa6a0f382d

Guess what happened on the 8th October 2020?

[Price shot up by 41.4&#37; with a staggering volume of 76 million shares](https://preview.redd.it/kktrcq0pt1761.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=d85baa22a8b5666de0e888355c90b8ce02c466f1)

**So there will be a short squeeze tomorrow? By how much?**

I am not a prophet but I am confident a squeeze will happen tomorrow. How much would be up to your own conclusion. All I can say is that back in October, almost everyone and their wives' boyfriend were bearish on GME other than the few OGs we have here. Ryan Cohen only had a 9% stake, GME gang and their theories were laughed off. Shorts were able to cover and close their naked shorts stealthily and without much trouble.

This time round, Cohen upped his stake to 13%. WSB Capital has entered the foray with approximately 5% stake, which will probably be watered down to 2.5% of diamond hands stake.  Senvest Management has entered with a 5% stake as well. Hedgeye with 90k twitter followers sets a PT of $50 for GME. Some big player has been buying lots of GME shares for the past 2 days. 30M and 25M volume respectively. There are still 68M shares short at the moment. The market closes early tomorrow at 1pm. Shorts will have to buy a shitload amount of shares in half a trading day. Don't forget, GME is attracting a lot of attention from FOMOs and boomers with the Hedgeye tweet. Shorts will have to compete with all these buyers to cover. True available float should be much lower this time round with more big players in, and retail investors knowing about the potential short squeeze, and most importantly pure autistic energy.

Edit: Just wanted to emphasise that this is a speculative take. 

My DD hinges on two assumptions: 

1. 8th october price increase is due to shorts covering rather than microsoft partnership news, or both.

2. Shorts haven’t been covering significantly for the past 2 days.",2020-12-24 03:04:23

GME DD Fresh Perspectives Pt 2. Gamestop vs Amazon,0.94,"Today’s DD is what I wanted to start out with. I know yesterday’s DD was boring but I just had to start by laying the foundation to establish *GME’s bare minimum growth case (if I were to put a number, a low double digit growth yoy, which in today’s world is just a survival case)* ***in the gaming industry***\*\*\*.\*\*\* This is their baseline. This is their foundation.

Today, I’m framing a bull case I haven’t seen others lay out the blueprint for. I hope you guys can all picture it. I am willing to bet this is at least some of what Cohen sees in Gamestop. If I were Cohen, I’d be all over Gamestop too. Disclaimer: I am in e-commerce myself and I’m in a niche within consumer electronics. Everything he mentions in the Jan 26th Forbes article is SPOT ON. 

Back in September, Cohen said “long term, he wanted to make Gamestop a true competitor to Amazon” (source A). No article in September specified  the “gaming industry.” To be honest, I feel that only got added in November because to be frank, no one saw it. Everyone laughed. 1:1 competitor? I’m not so sure about this one. I believe in you Ryan, but this might take some time.Co-existing among eBay ($35B), BestBuy ($26.5B), Amazon in the next 2\~3 years? 100% Doable. Being #2 amongst those names? Definitely achievable and the setup is too perfect to ignore.

**Gamestop vs Amazon. Advantage Gamestop has on Amazon**

* Gamestop has a location in every urban center. Even after closing 1000 locations that are losing money most likely due to them being in a mall, they still have 4000 locations. It’s time to think of them as 4000 distribution points/fulfillment centers and NOT brick and mortar stores. Amazon has 175 warehouses worldwide.
* They can deliver an item A LOT faster than Amazon or anyone else can. Almost as fast as you can get pizza/food delivery if you are in a major city.
* Instant delivery via Doordash (piloting, but no problems yet). For the generation that want everything right now, this is great
* Direct to consumer = no middle man = greater connection with consumers as well as greater profit.
* Safe to say that Gamestop has experience/buying power advantage over almost all, if not ALL eBay/Amazon sellers.
* By not having a huge warehouse and carrying 12 million SKUs, their operation is much more efficient. Consumer electronics with the exception of television, are all very compact. (It’s not a loss though a TV is not a hot item people replace every couple of years).
* They are already set up to take trade-ins of consumer electronics and already have a reputation for it.

**Trade-ins? What? Now here is where it's gonna get sweet.**

**Ever watch Forrest Gump? Cohen spots Forrest Gamestop sprinting through the field in a true autist form, but he sees the potential in him, as the fastest receiver of tendies. 🚀🚀**

* Consumer electronics is one of the most popular and one of the most profitable categories in ecommerce. Think drones, phones, computers, tablets, gaming consoles, VR… etc.
* It also comprises the most commonly bought and sold items on local classifieds such as Craigslist, Kijiji, and Facebook marketplace.
* When it comes to used consumer electronics, the profit margin can actually be bigger. In major cities, even as a ‘nobody’, it is not difficult to make $100 flipping devices, and flip 20 devices/week. (no repair, just be quick with cash on hand and be reliable) This is how I got started so I know firsthand.
* Currently the only business with a global presence to facilitate buying/selling them used to have it delivered to you is eBay.

**Where eBay & others fail/their MAJOR drawbacks when it comes to used or new but remember, when it comes to used, these are the ONLY names in the game.**

* Long shipping times (eBay)/ many inconveniences to put up with to get the product (offline)
* Inconsistency.
* Risk of fraud or at the very least, risk of time being wasted leading to frustration.

Do you see it now? Gamestop is a unicorn hybrid in the marketplace filling the gap between Amazon and eBay, in the most profitable and most category in ecommerce as well as offline, with faster delivery, and you can bet your ass that with Cohen running it, better customer experience.

Name one other business that can fill the gap.

**But c’mon dude. With a name like Gamestop? How do you think they can establish this in people’s hearts and minds as the consumer electronics shop?**

How about this name? PowerUp, now it makes more sense, right?

They already have 55M PowerUp members, compared to 165M Amazon Prime members, it’s not a lot. At the same time, it’s not little, but GME has also created a revolving door by giving them more in store credit than cash for their trade ins.

**Valuation**

All shorts are underwater at $16.00 right? Let me use $16.00 as an example, because it will NEVER fall below it now. Meaning? shorts will eventually HAVE TO close. Shorts closing = buying of shares =**🚀🚀🚀**

$16 puts the market cap at $1,1B. Amongst 4000 stores. $276,000/store. Try setting up a store in locations Gamestop is set up at, with inventory and trained staff for $276,000.

It’s not possible. You would probably spend that on set up/reno and inventory alone and that’s not even including the brand presence that’s already built into people’s hearts and minds for buying and selling used consumer electronics.

Yeah but the valuation is low because they’re losing money! Without any of the things I mentioned today materializing, they’re going to be posting positive profit moving forward for sure after closing 1000 losing stores and focussing on e-commerce.

Guess what though? Gamestop is already slowly gearing towards what I laid out. Check out their website. Drones, tablets, VR, phones, consoles, used games, computers.

*Remember! ALL of what I laid out today, is ON TOP of the gaming foundation I laid out yesterday.*  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**

**Squeeze valuation**

$103 MINIMUM  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀** $326 Maximum before coming back down to $40. Timeline: 1\~4 months. I will talk about the squeeze valuation tomorrow. There’s a major positive I haven’t seen others mention.

Ask yourself, have you 4x’d your money in the past 1\~4 months?  **🚀**

With every cent GME drops, a viscious boomer nuts and his dentures flop out. They will resort to the dirtiest manipulation tactics to scare you.

GME. 1:15 and let them be for Margin in the expanse of degenerate gambling to show green on the Robinhood app”; and it was so.  

GME. 1:16 God made the two green spikes, the greater spike to liquidate Melvin capital, and the lesser spike to fuck 🌈🐻; He made the options also.  

GME. 1:17 WSB placed them in the explosion of the short squeeze to give light on the omnichannel gaming revamp,  

GME. 1:18 and to govern the traders and the retards, and to separate the cucks from the rich; and Cohen saw that it made tendies.

I posted this before in [Daily Discussion before](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kir3c3/daily_discussion_thread_for_december_23_2020/ggt8hjc/), and now I shall expand on it too.

I see lots of brothers crying over CRSR, so I am going to shine light on it.

1. CRSR have no marketing team(for stocks btw), they literally do not give a singular fuck about how their stocks do since IPO because of the busy holiday season.

1. It is a long hold, their current price is undervalued because no news are generated for the boomers/traders and you know they can't read anything tech related. Boomers don't care about what it does or what future it has, only whether it would make more money in the future.

>[And while Corsair has been losing money on all of these businesses over the last couple of years — a $13.7M loss in 2018 and an $8.4M loss in 2019 — it seems that COVID-19 has been good to Corsair. The company saw a $23.8M profit between January and June 2020 alone.](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21398656/corsair-ipo-billion-dollar-revenue-profit-coronavirus-shelter)

Covid recovered all their losses within 6 months, people are staying home and upgrading their stuff so they won't be working with a fucking windows XP computer or shitty laptop from home. 18% market share and 42% of gaming peripherals?

Oh it's ThE vErGe so it's not reputable???

**Straight from their S1 filing**:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743759/000119312520227100/d507744ds1.htm

>Leverage our software platforms to sell more gear to existing customers. Our software platforms integrate and enhance our ecosystem of gaming and streaming gear, which drives customer loyalty and allows us to successfully sell additional gear to existing customers.

>Strengthen relationships with end-users by increasing direct-to-consumer sales. Through **our acquisitions of Origin and SCUF in 2019, we acquired two companies whose sales are primarily generated through direct-to-consumer channels.** While sales from this channel are a **relatively small contributor to our revenue today, we believe direct-to-consumer sales represent a significant avenue to drive growth by facilitating increased market penetration across our product categories**.

>Continue to grow market share globally. As a globally recognized brand, we have a footprint that reaches customers in more than 75 countries. We will continue to invest in enhancing our sales and distribution infrastructure to expand our leadership position in the Americas and Europe. **In the gaming peripherals market, we have increased our U.S. market share from 5.0% in December 2013 to 18.3% in June 2020 on a trailing twelve month basis according to NPD Group.** We are a **clear market leader in the gaming PC components market.** According to NPD Group, we have **increased our U.S. market share from 26.2% in December 2015 to 41.9% in June 2020 on a trailing twelve month basis**. Additionally, **for the twelve months ended June 2020, we had number one U.S. market share in gaming computer cases with a 18% market share, cooling solutions with a 53% market share, PSUs with a 42% market share and high-performance memory with a 54% market share.** We view the **Asia Pacific region as a long-term growth opportunity and recently invested in our local sales force and regional management to build out distributor networks and retail partnerships.**

>Selectively pursue complementary acquisitions. We plan to evaluate, and may pursue acquisitions, such as our **acquisitions of Elgato, Origin and SCUF**, which we believe strengthen our capabilities in existing segments as well as diversify our product offerings, broaden our end-user base or expand our geographic presence.

Corsair does PC components(PSU, RAM, PC Case, fans, etc) and peripherals(Keyboards, mouse, headphones, etc). If you missed out on CPU(AMD, Intel) or GPU(Nvidia), this is it. Only competitors listed in NYSE/NASDAQ are Micron and IBM(Random-access memory (RAM) modules market competitors), and their company directions are very different. Rest of Corsair's direct competitors are mostly concentrated in foreign markets(Logitech, Asus, Razer, Samsung(RAM), Gigabyte, Fujitsu, Toshiba, etc) or private(Kingston, G.Skill, EVGA, Steelseries etc).

If you want to sell it, go ahead. I am not here to sell you a stock that will fly to the moon tomorrow. This is a long haul stock that's not for short term holders, this is for the people that recognise and understand the following:

#HERE

#Net revenue was ->$457.1 million<-, an increase of 60.7% year-over-year.

#Gamer and creator peripherals segment net revenue was $161.6 million, an increase of 128.8% year-over-year.

#Gaming components and systems segment net revenue was $295.5 million, an increase of 38.3% year-over-year.

#Recovered 2 years loss within 6 months of covid

#As of September 30, 2020, cash and restricted cash of $120.1 million, $48.0 million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of ->$370.1 million<-.

#That y-o-y growth with just 3B market cap

Stats from Q3 earnings report: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2123626/0/en/Corsair-Gaming-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html

**SO SHOULD I SELL????**

The stock is not GME(big daddy Cohen coming in to make it the ecommerce giant of gaming world), but they are pretty obviously undervalued. You should choose to at least hold it till Q4 earnings report in February which would include Christmas and holiday sales, that is also what people with GME, NVDA, AMD, AAPL and INTL wants to see. Q4 is where the money is always at for tech stocks thanks to Santa, especially so for CRSR who sees the largest sales number per annum on ecommerce site like Amazon during holiday season.

But yeah you can still choose to sell

So I can buy more.

Hello again, GME Gang. What a fun day we had yesterday! Could it continue today? Only Melvin Capital (and maybe Ryan Cohen) knows!

And an extra special hello today to our newest WSB lookie-loo, Mr. Cramer (Can I call you Jim? I’m gonna call you Jim).  

Now Jim, from what I’ve been able to gather, you and your Boomer stocks and your Hot Manic Takes don’t always get a lot of love around here. But that’s not *all* your fault, Jim. The Paste-Eating Rocket Kids are often good for a solid meme (FYI: it’s pronounced “Mee-Mee.” Feel free to use that on air without verifying). But the Rocket Kids can be a dense bunch and they’re also often one click away from Total Financial Ruin (Quick shout out to SPCE: Pleas fly again). So you have to dig a bit in here to separate the wheat from the chaff, as someone like you actually says in real life. What the fuck even is chaff, Jim? And why do all Boomers seem to think that folksy farm-based idioms are the perfect way to conclude a thought?

Anyway. Those of us who watched your teevee clips last week where you reference your interest in WSB know that you, Jim Cramer, might be one of the Olds, but that you also Think Young(TM). [https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/stock-market-advice-moderna-boeing-fed-ftc-dec-15](https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/stock-market-advice-moderna-boeing-fed-ftc-dec-15). So we’re going to do our best to help your young-thinkin’ brain find the Needle In the Haystack here so you can get All Your Ducks In a Row on GME.  Because we know that you’re a long way from being Put Out to Pasture, and though you may be an out-of-touch millionaire prone to facile yammering, we now ***like*** you here, Jim—simply because you mentioned us and that made us blush a bit since we’re needy Millennials who just want our Boomer mommies and daddies to Tell Us They’re Proud of Us. So even though the Paste-Eating Rocket Kids here are often Buying A Pig in a Poke (Christ, please do not *ever* say that or the kids’ Mee-Mees are gonna fuck you up), we appreciate you recognizing that, every now and then, there’s something worth paying attention to over in this weird little pocket of the Interwebs.  And since you’re actually telling your loyal single-finger-typin’ viewers to check out this WSB shitshow, and “*if they’re running GME, then do some work on GME*,” we assume you might actually be checking this shit out too, since all true Young Thinkers know that What’s Good for the Goose is Good for the Gander. 

Now, is the GME play as solid as your recent recommendation to buy Bed Bath and Beyond? Who knows? That seems pretty stupid, and I would look it up myself this weekend but my nice little Saturday is already pretty full so I don’t know—I don’t know if I’ll have enough time. But I’ll tell you one thing: the GME play is **a lot more fucking fun**.  Life in a pandemic is boring, but here in this weird WSB place, these kids like fun.  And for all your Boomer weirdness, you seem like you still like to have a little fun in this Mad, Mad world of ours. So consider joining us here more often.  A word of warning, though: if you don’t like all the dern cuss words we use around here, Jim, well that’s just, like, your opinion man, and we’ll have you know that the Supreme Court has roundly rejected Prior Restraint. 

First thing’s first: we have a bit of a bone to pick with you (now there *I* go). The stuff you said last week about GME as the next Blockbuster was D-U-M dumb, Jim. You were a bit out of your fucking element with that.  You even made our largest shareholder and conqueror-in-waiting, Mr. Ryan Cohen, send an emoji-only tweet in response, which if you know the super nice-guy Ryan Cohen like all of us do (we actually know nothing), that is pretty much the equivalent of him bringing his dog over to micturate on your and George Sherman’s rug.

Now, I myself have never been into the whole brevity thing, but I wanted to take this opportunity to get you up to speed on the GME movie you’ve wandered into. And I know you’re down with this because you told all your viewers that if WSB is talking about GME, then “make sure you know GME.” So before you say something Absolutely Mad again and Cohen sends a tweet with an even less ambiguous emoji, it’s high time that you start Making the Sure here, Jim. Just consider this to be CPT Hubbard delivering you some Orange Sunshine and turning you on to some of that Sweet, Delicious Non-Chaff Wheat you love so goddamn much. 

**Part 1: GME’s Bonkers-Ass Short Interest**

Now, I’m going to lead with the most crowd-pleasing part of the story here (Get ready, Rocket Kids!), and it’s the one that you did not even seem remotely familiar with in your “Stay out of GameStop, Deadbeat!” rant last week. Maybe that was by design or maybe not. We’ll return to that, Jim. But the point here is: the **short interest here is batshit insane**. And not just your garden variety Boomer in Rolled Up Sleeves Ranting About Buying Estee Lauder While Hitting Buttons On The Beep-Bop-Boop Machine kind of insanity. Really and truly fucking nuts.

So to TL/DR this shit for you, Jim (to use the parlance of our times): GME is **the** **most shorted stock** **trading today—by far**.   [https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today) How shorted? Well, the value of shares short exceeds the market cap of the company; there are currently ***more shares short than the total number of shares outstanding***. And when factoring in the institutional and insider ownership, the total short percentage of float is **nearly 300%**. [https://www.gurufocus.com/term/FloatPercentageOfTSO/GME/Float-Percentage-Of-Total-Shares-Outstanding/GameStop-Corp](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/FloatPercentageOfTSO/GME/Float-Percentage-Of-Total-Shares-Outstanding/GameStop-Corp) Even higher, actually, now that Cohen’s interest is over 10%.  Now, I’m not a numbers whiz like you, but that level of short interest and the small available float seems pretty fucked up to me. Like: “how is that even legal?” fucked up. And just for a frame of reference, the **third most shorted** security right now is your beloved Bed Bath and Beyond, with a short percentage of float at a nice and tidy 69%. But by all means run your manic ass over to the goddamn sound machine to get your viewers to munch on that big box stock.

Are you starting to gather why some of us in this weird little pocket of the Interwebs are a little excited about GME? You see, as u/Jeffamazon and RodAlzmann u/Uberkikz11 and others have explained in these here corners and on the twitter machine with their top-notch DD, and as I will translate to you in lingo you can dig, the short sellers got way over their skiis on this one expecting a bankruptcy in Spring of 2020 that never came. And yet, amazingly, the short interest has only **increased** since then—there has effectively been no covering in the aggregate and, in fact, the short percentage has only **gone up**. And now, on the threshold of 2021, we all sit atop a massive powder keg wondering what is going to be the thing that finally lights this shit up. And at the end of this little missive, I’m going to tell you what I think that thing might be (Spoiler: It’s Ryan Cohen! Better start getting used to seeing his name, Jim, because this dude does not fuck around and he’s not going anywhere).

**Part 2****: GameStop Isn’t Going Bankrupt and People Actually Want to Buy Shit There**

So, you foul mouthed little prick, a bonkers-ass short interest is neat and all, but why is Jim Cramer wrong when Jim Cramer compares GME to Blockbuster you might be asking yourself in the third person. First, the most obvious answer, Jim, which you should fucking know already: Blockbuster was **nearly $1 Billion in debt** and missing debt payments left and right when it was delisted way back in 2010. That was also when there was a bit of a credit crunch, if you recall, right after that whole Housing Crash Unpleasantness that you saw coming from a mile away and from which you made hundreds of millions of dollars due to your contrarian foresight—I’m sorry, I’m clearly confusing you with Christian Bale starring as Dr. Michael Burry, weirdo head of Scion Asset Management, which also holds about 1.4M shares of GME (You really gotta start looking into this stuff, Jim – this story is made for TV, man—and you Boomers were raised by TV and you turned out TV!). Also, in 2010 when Netflix is ripping and when Blockbuster was about to be delisted and bankrupt, an analyst noted the obvious fact that Blockbuster  had “nothing on the horizon that makes it look like Blockbuster is going to be more profitable.” 

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blockbuster/blockbuster-wins-debt-reprieve-forced-to-delist-idUSTRE66052720100702](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blockbuster/blockbuster-wins-debt-reprieve-forced-to-delist-idUSTRE66052720100702) 

But Jim, if your Blockbuster comparison has any plausibility, GameStop must have a major debt problem then, right? And yet just last month GameStop **repaid $125M in debt** several months ahead of time. It’s also really weird that over the past year management bought back a ton of shares, taking the OS from 102M **down to just under 70M** (making a short squeeze even more likely, my Rocket Children). The weirdness continues with a soon-to-be-bankrupt company holding almost $500M in cash on hand. And according to George Sherman’s “Thine Omnichannel Shalt Be The Omni-est Channel of Them All” Conference Call following Q3, by March 2021 GME will have retired a total of $500M in debt and returned $200M to shareholders through stock buy backs. I’m no expert here, and I do not presently own a Beep-Bop-Boop Machine, but that’s all pretty weird shit to be doing if you’re about to go bankrupt.

No, no – I get it: who the fuck actually looks at balance sheets anyway before spouting off about what a stock is going to do? I sure as hell don’t. That’s why I follow my man u/Uberkikz11, since that dude is a GME DD Encyclopedia and was born to crunch numbers. No, when Really Smart People make the Blockbuster comparison, it’s usually just Mouth Sounds for: A B&amp;amp;amp;M Store That Used to Be Popular But Now Is Not Because Technology, QED. But here even the Really Smart People might be missing something as well. They’re right in the sense that GME must use this new console cycle window and cash influx to quickly pivot to a tech-first gaming company (more on that and our boy RC shortly!), but they’re wrong on the timing and relevance of this Super Smart Insight.

So fine, they’re doing ok on debt and cash. But who even goes to that 90s-Ass-Looking Cluttered Mall Geekery anymore anyways? I confess: in my darkest moments, as the short sellers manipulate the fuck out of this stock and I curse the names Bell and Sherman, I too have wondered this. But it turns out that, just like I have no idea why anyone listens to Maroon 5 or eats at Applebee’s, apparently a lot of people in America do shit that I do not. Crazy huh? So here is some pretty neat data showing us how out of touch we might be here, Jim: 

First, when a pretty large sample size of people were recently asked the question: *which of the following stores or websites do you plan to buy holiday gifts from*? The **#5 response** from United States Americans was none other than **GameStop** (Ticker, Jim: GME). Only Walmart, Amazon, Target, and Dollar Store (poor people buy gifts too, Jim) were ahead of little old GameStop. That’s higher than Nike, Macy’s, the Apple Store—and **double** the response of Bed Bath and Fucking Beyond in every category they surveyed. Check it: (h/t to my man u/snowk88) 

[https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/260983915](https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/260983915)

That’s kinda crazy huh? See Jim, when you Think Young(TM), you really can learn something new every day. And by following our man u/snowk88 (@snowk88 over at stocktwits), I learn lots of cool shit. But guess who already knew that? The guy that wrote this bad ass letter that identifies GME’s brand and customer data as being one of the most valuable things GME has going for it.

So now we know that Real Life People actually buy shit at GameStop here in the year of our lord 2020. But like that analyst from 2010 said about Blockbuster, there must not be anything on the horizon for GameStop to be more profitable in 2021, right?

Now, I will admit that being a bit bearish on GME in December of 2020 would make more sense if, say, GameStop were the nation’s largest purveyor of limp and half-lit pumpkin spice-scented candles and we were exiting the apogee of Shitty Candle Season. But as it turns out, GameStop is currently selling basically the most sought-after items that exist in the marketplace right now—where demand for the Xbox and Ps5 is far outpacing supply and is projected to continue well into 2021.  [https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-11-17-microsoft-expects-xbox-series-x-s-shortages-until-q2-2021](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-11-17-microsoft-expects-xbox-series-x-s-shortages-until-q2-2021) I don’t really need to get into the details on that here, because it’s pretty goddamn obvious, but I think 2020 GameStop at the precipice of a new console cycle might be in a bit of a better position than, say, 2010 Blockbuster relying on the latest Adam Sandler release to lift its sagging rental numbers. But I don’t know. Millions of people don’t watch *my* show looking for Candid Analysis from me and *my* folksy man-of-the-people-lookin’ rolled-up sleeves.

**Part 3:** **Ryan Cohen is the Sword of Damocles Hanging Over the Short Sellers’ Dumbass Heads** 

And now we’ve gotten to the best part. It’s my favorite part of all of this, Jim, and if you give this a little time, I think it will be yours too. You see, all that corporate bla bla bla about balance sheets and console cycles and early debt repayment and overleveraged short sellers and brand recognition is neat and all—and definitely worth a second look by itself. Maybe even a little Beep-Bop-Boop on the ol’ sound machine—I don’t know your fucking methods. But the real thing that’s about to rip all our faces off here is the business and investment decisions of a mild-mannered wunderkind named Ryan Cohen.

Now you can revisit my prior epistle if you want to know a bit more about the involvement of Mr. Ryan Cohen in *Le Affair* *GameStop*. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kakxrm/gme\_tribe\_a\_story\_about\_how\_ryan\_cohen\_is\_about/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kakxrm/gme_tribe_a_story_about_how_ryan_cohen_is_about/).  My fly-by-night theory of his lawyer’s possible use of the consent solicitation could have probably marinated for another day, but the thrust of my argument there was that Cohen and his attorney have been laying the groundwork to come after GameStop for a while now. And that Cohen was likely emboldened by the humiliating, lame-ass CC performance by some dude with a mid-century comic-strip sounding name that we’ll all soon know only as: The Guy With the Punchable Face Who Used to Be CEO of GameStop.

But here is where things get really interesting. This is a story in the making, Jim, for fucks sake - take notes! This Monday, on December 21, Mr. Ryan Cohen filed a revised 13D showing that last week he started buying a shit-ton of shares—starting on Tuesday December 15th—which is ***the day after*** the stock price inexplicably plunged on Monday the 14th and the very same day you were yammering on the teevee about GME being Blockbuster! Instead of listening to you, however, Cohen started buying more GME shares (super-sleuth dark pool watchers u/rgrAi and u/snowk88 noticed in real-time that there was some very large accumulation taking place), which culminated in the big reveal that Cohen purchased a total of 2,501,000 additional shares last week—500,000 of which were purchased on Friday December 18, 2020 **at the price of $16.02 a share**. Ryan Cohen is still the single largest shareholder of GME with 9,001,000 shares in total, taking his ownership of GME above the 10% threshold from 9.98% to 12.9%. And so he apparently thinks that the floor for his investment is $16.02 per share. Is he still buying? We’ll know soon. But yesterday seemed like a little taste of what it might look like if a large buyer steps in to prevent short sellers from manipulating all of my nervous little Rocket Children here and their delicate little paper hands.

There was another thing we learned from this 13D filing: Ryan Cohen has apparently hired a new attorney and law firm. Instead of the great Christopher Davis of Kline Kaplan, now Ryan Cohen is represented by Ryan P. Nebel, a partner with Olshan Frome Wolosky, LLP.  Now, if you’re familiar with my prior ramblings, you might wonder if I was a bit confused, and maybe even a little sad, at this sudden change from my man C. Davis. And you might be a little right. But then the wonder of the internet allowed me to learn a bit about these new lawyers. And holy shit, things are about to get fun.

Now, I liked what I knew about Chris Davis and he seems like a genuine bad ass activist attorney. But the folks at Olshan Frome and Wolosky, LLP are Next Level Players and really seem tailor-made for this exact situation. First off, Olshan is ranked as **the top global lawfirm** for Activist Attorneys. [https://www.olshanlaw.com/assets/htmldocuments/Bloomberg%20Activism%20League%20Tables%20H12020.pdf](https://www.olshanlaw.com/assets/htmldocuments/Bloomberg%20Activism%20League%20Tables%20H12020.pdf) (H/t @flummoxed at stocktwits). They seem to be the go-to law firm for major proxy battles initiated by activist investors. But possibly even more important is that Olshan is the ***same firm that represented Hestia and Permit*** in their successful proxy battle earlier this year to appoint two new directors to the GME Board.  I’m not going into the fine details of that, because this is already a bit of a long-form Idiot’s New Yorker article, but GameStop just went through a proxy fight last year with Activist Investors Hestia Capital and Permit Capital, which resulted in two Board seats for our shareholder buds from Hestia and Permit. So, it’s reasonable to assume that the attorneys at Olshan might know their way around GameStop at this point and where the pressure points are here. 

[http://www.globallegalchronicle.com/hestia-capital-and-permit-capitals-two-new-directors-to-the-gamestop-board/](http://www.globallegalchronicle.com/hestia-capital-and-permit-capitals-two-new-directors-to-the-gamestop-board/)

And if you follow u/snowk88 over at stocktwits (@snowk88)—you don’t? ‘the fuck is wrong with you?— you’d also find a wealth of DD on how Olshan rolls when entering these activist-investor-replaces-dumbass-boards-and-CEOs type disputes. To bottom line it: **they get it fucking done**.

But what else did we learn from the 13D? We learned that Ryan Cohen is definitely not going anywhere any time soon. Specifically, the filing notes that RC Ventures intends to continue to engage in discussions with GameStop’s board *“regarding means to drive stockholder value, including through changes to the composition of the board and other corporate governance enhancements.""* And while RC Ventures *“desires to come to an amicable resolution with \[GameStop, it\] will not hesitate to take any actions that it believes are necessary to protect the best interests of all stockholders.”*

I really like that last part, don’t you? And although I thought his November 16th letter was pretty goddamn clear, this 13D just ratcheted up the transparency level here. In sum, Ryan Cohen has all of our backs and he’s going to replace this Board and Sherman with people that are on the level and that will help implement his vision.

And now seems like a good time to return to those “Ryan Cohen: Boy Genius” articles that were definitely NOT part of a well-coordinated pre-hostile takeover media campaign initiated earlier this year. I think there might be a few things in those articles that Mr. Cohen wanted all of us shareholders (as well as the short sellers and the Board he’s about to replace) to really and truly understand.  Recall also that Cohen is not one for diversification or for playing it safe. So here’s a few choice nuggets for you to ponder:

\*\*\*

Bloomberg, June 2020: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo)

· ""It's too hard to find, at least for me, what I consider great ideas,"" he says. ""When I find things I have a lot of conviction in, I go all-in."" 

· Cohen uses the word “conviction” a lot. He says it’s something he learned from his father, who ran a glassware importing business in Montreal where Cohen grew up. “He taught me how to block the noise from the masses,” says Cohen. “To have a point of view and have conviction and not waver.”

· He wouldn’t, however, recommend his \[non-diversified\] investment approach to everyone. “You need to have the temperament to block the noise,” he says. “Sometimes it feels like a roller coaster.”

· He likens his obsessive focus on building Chewy to his approach to stock picking. ""I don't want to swing for a single,"" he says.

\*\*\*

You hear that, Jim? Our man Cohen likes idioms too! But fuck those farm idioms, Jim – we’re upgrading to the Sportsball kind now.  So what’s the takeaway here? I’d say that Cohen has his Eye On The Ball and that it’s time for all short sellers and the Board to Throw in The Towel because Ryan Goddamn Cohen likes to Take the Bull By The Horns and will ensure that he Hits a Homerun for shareholders that believe in his vision.

Here’s a few more things Mr. Cohen wants all of us to know:

\*\*\*

Forbes, August 2020: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=41e1370e5840](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=41e1370e5840)

· “For me, each no sounded like they just didn’t understand my vision. It was frustrating at times, but never discouraging. Those ‘no’s never made me doubt my strategy – it was the opposite. I was motivated by all the rejections and they just got me fired up.”

· “I understood that thinking big was likely going to be misunderstood along the way. I’m contrarian by nature, so being misunderstood often validates what I’m doing. It wasn’t until Chewy boxes were on doorsteps across the country that the bulk of investors started to recognize our formula.”

· “\[M\]y biggest risk would have been not taking risk. The risk of going head-to-head against Amazon. The risk of insourcing fulfillment. The risk of building a company in Florida rather than a popular tech hub. The risk of spending $3 million a month on TV ads, more than Home Depot HD -0.1%'s budget. The risk of hiring expensive executives even though we weren’t profitable. These decisions were some of the most controversial and required me being comfortable betting against conventional wisdom, and were often contrary to the advice of my board. Suffice it to say, I was not the most popular board member.”

· “Dad never swayed when he believed in something. I never compromised my vision, regardless how many investors turned me down I was not going to give up on building Chewy into the world’s biggest online pet retailer. I love to be challenged, and I’m flexible on details, but I’m never willing to give up.”

\*\*\*

Goddamn it, Ryan. I was done having children but now you’ve forced me into getting back on that train just so I can name this future child Ryan Fucking Cohen. Thanks a lot, asshole.

But to return to my point: are those the statements of a man that seems likely to walk away at this point? Or is Cohen trying to tell us all to get ready because he is going **All In** on this shit?

So where does this leave us? After a huge week where Cohen buys 2.5M more shares and then the SP skyrockets to $20 yesterday on that news? Well, this is where I want to tip my cap to my man Justin Dopierala over at Seeking Alpha and allow him to conclude this section. He, along with his pal Dmitriy Kozin have been pretty clear-eyed on all this shit for a while now and they both deserve some credit. And I know I gave my main man Justin a bit of a hard time in my last novella, but the dude is sharp as hell and helped a lot of us see the forest through the trees here.  And you should also definitely invite him to join your poker nights (seriously: check out the dude’s tweet in response to our own Rod Alzmann’s introduction of the #WeWantCohen hashtag right after the Q3 call debacle). [https://twitter.com/DOMOCAPITAL/status/1336446055685230592](https://twitter.com/DOMOCAPITAL/status/1336446055685230592)  You have no comment on a potential takeover involving Ryan Cohen, Justin after your hour-long googly-eyed call together? Can’t believe you’re just preemptively leaving the WSJ and Bloomberg hanging like that. Justin, I love you dude, but if I’m holding pocket Kings I’m folding after that tweet because that twinkle in your eye lets me know you’re about to drop two Aces on my ass.

Anyway. Here is what our man Dopierala thinks might happen here soon (and he called this way back on November 17th- and sorry - no links here, per the mods, as apparently no Alpha must ever be Sought from these parts):

*I think a very likely outcome at this point is a majority slate next shareholder meeting where Cohen takes over BOD and then makes himself CEO. A majority slate proxy battle would require all institutions to call in shares and would force a squeeze.*

We’re intrigued, Justin. Please continue:

*If Ryan Cohen successfully negotiates a purchase price with the Board then the shareholders will have to vote on it. Unlike the proxy battle where Hestia and Permit were running a minority slate of directors, an offer to purchase GameStop would force institutions like Vanguard and Blackrock to call in their shares. By doing so, the shorts would be forced to close out their positions and GameStop would finally have the greatest short squeeze of all-time. Ironically, Cohen could use this opportunity to sell all of his shares and use the proceeds to entirely fund the acquisition of GameStop going down as the first person in history to acquire a billion dollar company... for absolutely nothing. In fact, his acquisition price would be less than zero.*

And now is when I get to speculate on what I think is going to happen here. But I do not necessarily think Cohen is going to put an offer to buy GME to take private. That would definitely trigger a MOASS, but I’m not sure I see it given the attorneys he’s hired and his recent buys up to $16 and the amount of cash that would take. Like Dopierala’s *first* comment, though, I think Cohen is going to nominate directors to replace nearly the entire Board of Directors with a vote happening at the annual meeting and once that Board is in place, they’ll appoint Cohen as CEO. And as Justin notes, if he nominates a majority slate of directors, shares will have to be called in to vote. And this vote and proxy battle will make the prior minority slate Hesita/Permit battle, and the tiny short squeeze that took place when that happened, look tame by comparison. Now everyone: get your calendars out. Because the date to nominate directors here is in **Mid-March**, and my super-smart corporate lawyer buds inform me that it’s standard practice to file about 7-10 days prior. So, if this actually happening, we should be seeing something on this by **early March**.

But even though early March is now the mark on the wall, today’s insane price action caused me to think about all of this a bit harder and speculate a bit more. And a major h/t to my buds on the stocktwits board, especially u/rgrAi (@amarbar) for all the sharp analysis on this. But if you were Ryan Cohen and you knew this company was hugely undervalued and you had a high level of **CONVICTION** here and also knew you needed shareholder votes to sweep out these dumbasses and implement your vision—then how would you play this with the short interest here as crazy as it is? I’d keep buying. Why? Well, lots of reasons, you smart alecks. First, so I have more guaranteed votes (duh?). Second, so that when the building starts burning and short hedge funds run for the exits they find that a mild-mannered Millennial with super-good ideas has sealed off all the doors and windows. That’s gruesomely delicious, isn’t it? Why else, CPT? Well, finally, and maybe most importantly, because I would want to excite and delight all my fellow shareholders by triggering a slow-burn short squeeze, raising the SP significantly, so that I can once again make the point (as he did in the Nov 16 letter) that the incompetent management that caused a **HUGE drop in SP** following that utterly incompetent Q3 call and the shelf registration, had **nothing to do with the SP increase** that again happened once Cohen announced his intent and started buying. Not the console cycle, not the cost containment measures, not the buybacks and not the early debt reduction. Nope: rightly or wrongly, shareholders will see Ryan Cohen buying shares and the corresponding SP increase and everyone—especially all new buyers who are delighted at their good fortune and swept up by Ryan Cohen Fever 2021—will start getting #WeWantCohen tattoos on their ass they’ll be so happy. And all of us, newly enriched by Ryan Cohen’s Big Canadian Balls and tactical brilliance, will crawl over glass to vote for him over The Boomer Artist Formally Known As GameStop’s CEO. I could be very wrong on this last point in particular, but if we start seeing 13Ds drop here shortly, things should get very fun very quickly. 

**Part 4: A Return to Our Short-Squeeze-to-Da-Moon Discussion: Who’s Side Are You Fucking On, Jim?**

Now, Jim, given the fast friendship we’re creating here, and all we’ve been through over the past 5000 words, I hesitate in bringing this up. But we’ve all seen the video, Jim. You know the one I’m talking about. Yes, the one where you actually tell the truth about how short selling hedge funds manipulate the market to knock down the price of perfectly good securities that many hard-working people *invest in*—many normal-ass people all assuming they wont ever have to Point Where On The Dolly The Invisible Hand of the Economy Touched Them. But that’s not life now is it Jim? And fuck those poor-ass rubes for not knowing how to play the game with you sophisticated Masters of the Universe, *amirite*?

[https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/93evx4/jim\_cramer\_reveals\_dirty\_tricks\_short\_sellers\_use/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/93evx4/jim_cramer_reveals_dirty_tricks_short_sellers_use/)

[https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/cramer-market-manipulator/](https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/cramer-market-manipulator/)

So where are **you** in this whole GME/Cohen story, Jim? You candidly (gleefully?) acknowledge that a prime strategy that shorts deploy is to spread negative rumors that are then amplified by Big Smart Trustworthy Financial Media Titans like yourself to shake out unsophisticated retail players like my Rocket Kids here—who because of their tiny paper hands and you mean short selling brutes often subsist on paste and paste alone. 

So for this particular security, are you the one helping with the manipulation and actively creating the “new truth” or are you just one of the Useful Idiots that these short sellers use to manipulate with an anodyne, TV media-ready comparison like: *GameStop Is The Next Blockbuster*? And how in the fuck does this fit into your Think Young(TM) project, Jim? Because if there is one thing that we over at WSB fucking hate, it’s a bunch of Manipulative Short Selling Boomer Fuckwads. Why on earth would a hip Young Thinker like you want to be included in that crew, Jim?

And I know we’re all friends here now, Jim, but I need to push back a bit on some of what you said in that video in such a cavalier whatareyagonnado manner. So if I understand you, short and distort and fomenting negative reactions from retail players based on deliberately false narratives is ***illegal***, but still easy as fuck to do ""because the SEC doesn't understand it."" But you fucking do understand it, Jim! So why are you helping those short and distorters break the law here? Why are you being such an obtuse dumbshit? Just check out what happens to the borrow rate and short selling every time there is any good news for GME: 

[https://stocktwits.com/Slantedangles/message/264519950](https://stocktwits.com/Slantedangles/message/264519950) (h/t @slantedangles). This manipulation isn't just happening with GME; it is happening *everywhere*. It’s baked into the cake. And that is pretty fucked up that we all just accept it because *whatareyagonnado*.

I think that one thing that those of us who truly do Think Young(TM) have a hard time understanding is at what point in your lives do you Boomers all finally come to realize that it’s maybe time to stop playing the game like you have been? What point do you finally have enough where doing the right thing matters more than getting paid? Maybe start by telling the truth more often—and maybe don’t go out of your way to help those corrupt-ass hedge fund managers who continually fuck over average people *merely because they were stupid enough to believe you all*. What contempt you Masters of the Universe have for all of them—for all of *us*. There is a bigger story here on GME and this out-of-control short interest (naked shorting, counterfeit shares)   [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) than even Ryan Cohen and the inevitable short squeeze we’re about to witness here. And it begins and ends with people like you and Melvin Capital and Bank of America not giving a fuck about the rules while thinking you’re smarter than the rest of us who do—but who lack power to do anything about it. And you know what? Maybe you *are* smarter than us. You certainly know how to play this game pretty well, as that video shows. But if I know my old school 1980s movies like I think I do, this is usually the part of the story where the rag-tag kids from across the tracks come over to show you hubristic rich fuckheads what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass. 

Now I myself have never dabbled in pacifism, Jim, so this isn’t too much of a stretch for me, but seeing that video of yours and seeing the insane short interest and all the manipulation here makes me want to burn the whole corrupt system to the ground—while barricading the doors to trap in those arrogant-ass short sellers who lie and cheat and distort to profit off average people. And though I’m certain that this larger battle is not driving him, maybe that result is one that Ryan Cohen wouldn’t mind too. Though he’s a polite Canadian and would probably just let everyone know that he’s not really mad, just disappointed. But me?  I’m an Angry American and I say: Block the fucking doors and windows and light that shit up. 

So maybe this epistle will be useful for your Think Young(TM) project and cause you to reflect a bit more on what’s really going on out there with this whole GME thing and the likely illegal shorting that has driven the short percentage of float to these insane levels, drawing in new retail shorts too stupid to know what’s even happening.  Or maybe it wont cause you to reflect in the slightest (count me as one of those cynical types that see your overtures to WSB as a transparent play for greater market share from the Young Crowd since your old-ass audience is dying and/or switching to bonds).  But in a few months when all the Billy Ray Valentines and Louis Winthorpes assembled here are toasting each other in stupid shirts on a white-sand beach somewhere, we do not want you to look back on your knee-jerk boomer-ass dismissal of GME and your Useful Idiot blathering with that same tinge of regret and longing you feel when you look at a pre-Client 9 picture of you and your old roomie: warm-toes-and-hosiery-enthusiast E. Spitzer, Esq.

In conclusion: GME = Blockbuster comparisons are for Simps and Corrupt Short-and-Distorters. Don’t be like them, Jim.  And to my Rocket Children: the only weapon we wield in this stupid game is Diamond Hands with a float like this. Toughen the fuck up.

And Happy Holidays everyone.

\--CPT Hubbard

**TL/DR**: Jim Cramer likes farm-based idioms and apparently being a useful idiot to scummy short selling hedge funds. DD on the GME turnaround is solid and overleveraged short sellers should be shitting themselves. Ryan Cohen, our polite, hard-working Canadian benefactor is about to rip all our fucking faces off and trigger a MOASS. Probably even by early March, if that time is good for you (he’ll text before he comes).  And fuck infinite regress: It’s rockets all the way down here.  **🚀🚀🚀** Now: diamond hands, motherfuckers.

according to https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities gamestop has been on the threshold list every single day since december 8th.

and then according to https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm (there is some basic info on short selling as well): ""In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency **must immediately purchase shares** to close out failures to deliver in securities with large and persistent failures to deliver, referred to as “threshold securities,” **if the failures to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days**.""

does this regulation apply in this case? where is the catch? surely market makers would be aware of this and wouldn't be outsmarted by some autists here.

I'm too much of an autist myself to understand the full picture, anyone care to enlighten me?

GME DD Fresh Perspectives Only Pt.1,0.97,"**GME Fresh Perspectives Pt.1** (sources at the bottom)

Hello Autists,

Here is the Pt1 of daily fresh perspectives I promised. I’m breaking them down to chewable bits (less than 5 min read ea) because I know reading isn’t fun. I’m with you, I don’t enjoy reading either. Give it to me straight if this gets too boring.

Through this series of DDs, I hope to show you guys perhaps *some* of what Cohen sees.

Please note that I will be referring to these 2 points in this DD, and maybe even throughout this DD series. These are the most important points that would form the foundation of my DD but they aren't the 'freshest' I apologize.

**1. Let me start by pointing out that most of us WSB autists are privileged. There exists the others, who actually make up the majority of the population** who/whose kids can’t afford to risk losing hundreds if not thousands of dollars making “educated guesses”/gambling the way we do.

As a group, it’s easy for us to confirm each other’s biases, forget about the rest and create our own echo chamber.

**2. Digital games is overtaking physical copies. This is true.**

SONY, EA, Take Two all have crossed a tipping point where more than half of their console games are now sold via download 51%, 52% and 55%

For Sony, it was up from 37% last year. (Source A)

Generally, the growth of digital vs discs seems to be quite even, so using SONY as an example, that’s a 38% increase (Yes. It’s a 14% difference, but it’s a 38% increase from 37% that takes it to 51%). That means GME’s going to experience apx 26% decrease YOY in sales.

\*\*BUT!\*\*The global console games market is expected to grow from $40.6 billion in 2019 to about $57.9 billion in 2020 (source B) That’s a 42.6% increase.

&#x200B;

[The numbers,](https://preview.redd.it/wiy7milvwu661.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=795d2a001ba7d25b4e7275f732ba8514d3df0c17)

**Young Mason:** This mean physical copies are dying! GME is DEAD!

Not quite. Actually, not at all. GME will definitely get a smaller percentage of the *console game pie*, but the pie itself has grown and they will actually end up with a larger slice.

**But wait, there’s more!** The research/stats was published in May. Did anyone project COVID will be as bad as it is now? Stay at home kids want to play games, meet desperate WFH parents that want a break. I am confident that the 2 factors push the numbers a lot higher than $57.90 Billion, but hey for now let’s just use that. Also remember, that % for digital games download vs physical is based on quantity including all the shit/old games they push for cheap and people buy out of boredom. Although the numbers aren’t reported solid, the consensus is, is that more disc consoles are sold because people want to play their old disc games. Even at a modest 50/50, we’re locked in more or less until the next console cycle.

\*\*But wait, there’s even more!\*\*So the console pie has grown 42.6%. You know what else has grown and is growing?

Gaming overall! Mobile, PC, even board games, they’ve all been growing. Checkout Gamestop’s website.

They’ve been getting into phones, computer parts and board games. It’s not out of desperation. It is the right move as Gamestop is really establishing its brand as one stop shop for games. When you think building supplies, you think Home Depot. Soon, when you think games, you will think Gamestop.

Gamestop is already set up for used games/devices trading like no one else. Phones are super liquid and high in demand (This isn't anything serious YET, I will cover this in another DD). Did I tell you that the digital consoles are now more tradable/rentable too? No moving parts = very low risk of damage other than drops/spills. Keep an eye on this. Remember the point #1.

Carrying computer parts also shield them from any sort of lockdown possibility because computer parts are essential. Bigger pie, and more pies.

**What you are saying makes sense… but bro, don’t you remember Q3 earnings?**

Yes, I do…Bro. They had a decrease in revenue. Do you remember Q3 was for August, September, October?

Were you really thinking about video games back then? We were all out there seeing friends, partying, enjoying nature thinking either Covid was gone and it was renaissance or thinking second wave is coming, and we have to enjoy it while it lasts.

**Establishing its brand? Are you nuts? People hate GME.**

Yes. **We do**. We all have that bitter memory. We remember the day when we or our friend went to GME to literally get hustled as a noob kid like we remember going to the strip club to get hustled as a noob adult.

Remember, we are ALL 18\~40+, ‘privileged’ minority. (Point#1).Peak gaming target demographics is around 13\~25.

Right now, GME is putting trade value of all games online, updated daily and it isn’t as ‘hustly’ as it used to be. This is a simple change, but powerful. People now know exactly what to expect, and they’d only bring in the games/consoles when they see the money/credit is worth more for them.

Results? Happier transactions on both ends, and better branding moving forward.

They’ve also been spending a lot more on advertising for brand recognition. That recognition will soon put them in a spot where they are the only one that can organize e-sports/gaming tournaments in the western world in any meaningful way.

I will leave you with this. The majority (Point #1) isn’t so lucky to start blowing money at the launch of a new console. Where can the majority go to fill their increased gaming needs while being fiscally conservative during this pandemic? eBay? With all the shipping delays?

Like how Amazon is eating eBay’s breakfast but eBay will always have its market share in ecommerce, GME will always have its place in gaming at the very least.

**Tomorrow I will tell you why GME will crush Amazon and not the other way around, and also touch up on either what their current valuation means to Cohen, or the future of gaming.**

Don’t worry, I’m even going to cover Stadia at one point too.

Edit: Positions:  My position on GME is made up of shares as well as options JAN 15 15C, 30C, APR 16 30C. GME makes majority of my port.

GME short squeeze is a myth that assumes massive incompetence from people that actually know what they are doing.,0.4,"So with GME running the myth of the inevitable short squeeze has popped up again.  In order for this to happen a ton of people need to short the stock naked.  Which among competent investors is really fucking rare.  I will walk through it below but you can also click this link:

https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/021715/how-protect-short-position-options.asp

For example let’s assume you wanted to short GME today at $20 a share.  So you sell 100 shares short at $20 each.  With a naked short you have unlimited losses as the stock runs up.  Nobody who knows what the fuck they are doing is going to do that when you can hedge to cap that loss.  A single January 21 call at a strike of 21 had a high of 2.42 today would hedge that just fine.

You short the shares and buy the call.  Your break even is now 17.68 on your short but your max loss is now $342 without borrowing costs assuming it closes at $20.99 on expiry.  Call expiring worthless for loss of $242 and $99 to cover the short.  

Borrowing costs on 100 shares at 20% and stock at 20 is about $1 a day.  Assuming everything is held to expiry with the January expiry would be about $25.

So max loss regardless of how high the stock goes is less than $400.

Your break even is kind of ass but that’s because you are protected until mid Jan.  However if IV is particularly high, even if the stock goes down pushing your return on the short up, the call might still retain enough value that your break even is much higher.  

If it’s a short term play which a short on today would likely be, you could buy a call for Friday which had a high of 1.15 today which puts your break even at 18.85 assuming you hold until Friday at close.  Factoring in borrowing cost it’s 18.8.  

That’s a hedged short which likely the vast , vast majority of GME shorts are.  Have you not noticed how fucking expensive relatively speaking call options are even with the spikes. A 20c at close with 1.5 days to expiry had a break even at 20.72 with a volume of 30,000.  Now part of that is people buying lottos but a ton of that is covering shorts.

So the whole premise of there are millions of shares that are short at $5 or $7 is some serious bullshit.  Yes there were 70m shares short give or take 2m at the end of October and there were the same number of shares short at the end of November.  This does not mean they are the same fucking people shorting it. Some have covered, some executed hedges and others have sold that shit short at higher prices.

For example today alone 8m shares were shorted.

https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme

Yesterday there were 3m shares shorted.  Borrowing rates are in the 20% range, which works out to around $1 total per 100 shares.  Or a single fucking tick downward.  So no institutions aren’t going to be covering shares they shorted at $15 when it spikes to $19.

But why has it been spiking if it’s not a short squeeze, and that’s really fucking simple, a ton of people are playing the momentum on it.  Hell 10% of the daily thread is people spamming to buy shares and you can make some money provided you don’t buy the top.  Its not a coincidence that they announce the stimulus and the stock spiked and I would be willing to bet that the vast majority of shares bought today were through Robinhood.

But Cohen you say?  He added another 3%, yeah he added 3% directly on the dip after earnings.  He’s in at $12 - $13 range based off the timings of the 13d.  If you are wondering what happens if he decides that the board isn’t being accommodating enough and drops his shares look at what happened the day Buffet said he was dropping airlines.  He can eat the ride down to $13 and still be profitable.

Then finally the biggest piece to the short squeeze is long term positive catalysts, the last significant short squeeze came from ACB two earnings ago when they closed the gap on their loss and cancelled their at the money offering.  At that point the long term growth story fundamentally changed as did the state of the business.  That’s what it takes to force a short squeeze, doubling e-commerce sales when overall sales are still massively down isn’t going to cut it.  A slightly green quarter during the launch of multiple new consoles isn’t going to do it either.  Now if they follow that with another solidly profitable quarter in May, at that point a squeeze is possible.


TL:DR:  The infinite short squeeze on GameStop is a bullshit argument assuming basic competence from anyone shorting the stock.  Options were in fact originally designed to offset the risks of shorting.  It will go up as long as more people are willing to become bagholders, just don’t be shocked when it comes crashing down.  It also explains the crazy ass high IV on call options.",2020-12-23 03:31:07

GME autists. Please DO NOT let the SHORTS Manipulate you like this again.,0.97,"**Do you remember the last weekend of November 2020?** We had rallied from 12.xx to $16.18. AH reached 17+ We opened on Monday at $18.90.

   The hype was so real that whole weekend. I remember that weekend clearly. I thought that finally, our day is coming. Can you relate? 

   However, the shorts actually saw this coming, and one short spent $17.8 Million dollars to keep the price down. This was one of the largest, if not the largest purchase of GME options ever (including calls). Note the timing at 3:51PM (ET)

What happened on December 1st? Soon after the market opened, for ""no reason"" we lost steam. It became a yet another one of those feedback loop situation. It started to drop, and we the boonies gas station non absorbent single ply paper handed autists that expect nothing but multi baggers in 48 hours or less lost interest. We sold, the price came lower, we sold more... etc and eventually what could have been a potential rally day ended with lower at $16.56

   Please keep this in mind that we, retail/WSB as a collective are very easily manipulated. Just remember the wise words. ""*Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice... you can't be fooled again!""* Diamond hands!

   **Just know that the squeeze is against large players that are diamond hands and diamond balls, as a result, the squeeze will likely not be fast and violent but you can expect it to be AT LEAST like JMIA or SFIX. Zoom out a little bit and check out them graphs.**

   If you are thinking about getting into GME, it's not too late for either stocks or options. Don't worry about options' liquidity when it squeezes if you are thinking options. There will be plenty of MMs willing to buy it to exercise and sell the shares for some profit.

Apple now is having an insane run up because of this beyond stupid EV Gold Rush and will most likely dip again after as well.

What I am trying to say is this:

If you get lucky, if you get an insane insane run up.  SELL!

For gods sakes don't be like the countless posts we use to see when people were more honest about how they made 10's or 100's of thousands and then lost every cent.

Right now WSB is in it's boom cycle and it's obvious to see by the style of posts and such.  It does this every once and a while, only now not as much honesty on the losses.  It has insane cult like confirmation bias.

Guys take your money and get out.  For some of you this is life changing money, even for some where it doesn't seem life changing - think of all you can do with this money and what you would be pissed if you didn't have.

Why a $150 price target for GME is realistic,0.94,"Today’s 25% move upwards was pure authentic buying. According to \[iborrowdesk\]([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)), shares available for borrow did not change at all today. This shows 2 things.

&#x200B;

 Firstly, the institutional shorts like BOfA and melvin have yet to cover, yet are getting pushed further underwater. When/If the squeeze eventually occurs, it is going to be violent. This also shows that the price dips at the 19 range was not a short attack but rather weak hands profit taking. 

&#x200B;

Secondly, a big player is accumulating. Either it’s Cohen trying to increase his stake for takeover(he’ll have to report within 2 days), or another institution buying. Either way its bullish.

&#x200B;

Now, heres the important part. Take a look at this chart, paying attention to the red crayon marks.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5i6dco7lqr661.jpg?width=3038&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d2c3e40eb68b649d7d8b42eb6acff2ad4f3a970

Before every console season, some idiots start shorting GME, resulting in a mini short squeeze in 2008 and  2014. At its peak, it had a share price of about $64. Now, take a look at how much higher the short interest is, and how much lower the float (total number of shares issued) is. Accounting for the same peak market cap, this gives a conservative estimate of $150 if the squeeze occurs. Note that due to the significantly higher short interest, it may very well exceed 150 by a mile.

&#x200B;

Lastly, for the short squeeze to occur, we need to all stop being paperhanded bitches. stop fucking selling at a 20% gain when u can easily get a 10x gain. The more liquidity u give to shorters, the less violent the short squeeze.

GME search trends,0.98,"I'm a pretty big fan of Google Trends. I think it's one of the best free ways to do some real time DD. It's flawed in many ways because it's not always clear why people are searching for something. Just because ""Ford Cars"" becomes a big search term it doesn't necessarily mean that Ford is going to go up, it might mean Ford cars began to explode, etc.

With that in mind, and also bearing in mind this is all *my opinion* on things, here are some of the search trends for GME.

https://imgur.com/a/rDktx4x

Checking the search term ""Gamestop Playstation"" lets you compare across years. What this chart means is that the search term ""Gamestop Playstation"" in Nov 2020 is about 400% larger than it has been since 2012. You'll note that the chart includes 2013, the year the PS4 was released.

The bump for Xbox is there but not as huge. It still does beat all of the last 9 years including the launch of the Xbone.

https://imgur.com/a/Jg4rA8g

Hang on because this is where it gets a little bumpy. I have contended that COVID is damping down interest in going to GME stores in person. That's a tough one to tease out of this data but I think you can get a proxy.

First, searches for ""is gamestop open""

https://imgur.com/a/rXAsSvt

That huge blue dildo at the end is a break from the past which would normally occur at Nov to Dec, this year it happened starting March. I think you can guess why. But why does this matter?

The next chart is ""gamestop trade in"" which we know is a big part of their business. You see a spike in 2013 when the last gen consoles were released. Then you see an even bigger spike the year after as people are getting new used games for the consoles they bought the year before. Then a long steady trend down, which makes sense.

Now pay close attention, when did this search term start to plunge way below its trendline, yes right as COVID started. I contend that COVID is suppressing interest in game trade ins and we will see a massive rebound when COVID gets its boot off our neck.

Selling Put Leaps on AMC,0.95,"https://preview.redd.it/e6tkyftirn661.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a25f3b0cca12b3529dcb108cfc3232d5bad01c1

As it stands, analysts have AMC at about 52-56% chance of bankruptcy. I am pretty sure it's not going to happen, so I am putting my money where my mouth is.

AMC $2p 1/21/22 x50. I put up $10k collateral and receive $5,851 in credit, so I am really only putting up $4,149 on this bet (max loss). If it holds above $2 by expiration, I'll make 140% in 13 months. Heck, I still profit if it stays above $1.

I don't think AMC is going to do well, but I think they will limp along until summer of 2021 and then start to recover. If AMC goes back to $5 or $6 in the next 3-6 months and the price of the contract drops to like $0.50 or so, I'd probably exit and use the capital elsewhere.",2020-12-22 03:36:26

GME: Why it's time for shorts to give up.,0.96,"Alright retards, listen up. Im back with some more bullish DD on our very favourite gamestop incorporation. To preface, I am not a financial advisor so fuck off SEC and mods. If you're new here, the old DD is there for you to read, I wont repost it. The best way to hold this is **BUYING AND HOLDING SHARES**.

As we know, the gamestop bankrupt hypothesis is completely obliterated at this point and for the mid to long term future. the NeXt BlOcKbStEr bullshit is out the window. done. I'm also not going to talk about any type of short squeeze, we already know about that and you can read about that elsewhere. 

**Heres a list of things that we know:**

* Cohen *just* increased his stake in gamestop to almost 13%.
* Gamestop is closing unprofitable locations
* Gamestop is *omnichanneling* their retard energy into online 
* Melvin capital has a MASSIVE short position and they are sweating
* BofA also has a large short position
* Sherman is clueless
* Gamestop will likely surprise wall street with their holiday sales and eps 

But why is this important? Who gives a fuck? dont we already know this shit?

Many saw cohen as a potential catalyst but it was a gamble. Since he entered his position at such a low share price, he could easily leave it and take a profit. And after suffering through that earnings call the two options for cohen were: GTFO or hostile takeover. 

* Since cohen ***Increased*** his holding after that debacle, it is easy to see that he will not be leaving us high and dry. **It is now impossible for sherman to dilute his position to under 11%. He is preparing for war.** We can speculate all day into what this means, but one thing is certain. If GameStop doesn't shape up, Cohen will do ***Something.*** This is bullish

This one's a no brainer, but sometimes can scare people off. Headlines that GameStop is closing more stores may seem bearish, but heres why it's not: 

* It's no secret that brick and mortar is falling off, and if GameStop were to fight tooth and nail to remain a largely brick and mortar retailer they would go bankrupt in no time. It is also a fact that underperforming stores drain cash, which lowers net income and thus lowers earnings per share. Any store that is ***LOSING MONEY*** or is barely breaking even is keeping the stock price down because it's preventing future growth and killing net incomes. **Closing underperforming stores will lead to a higher EPS and more cash that can be allocated to growth.**

Gamestop is rebranding, and shifting to becoming the **one stop video game and video game related product online retailer.** While we haven't seen exactly what this will be, it is bullish to see them pivoting into other products besides just video games. Headsets, TVS, PC parts, you name it. You've seen the omnichannel memes, but we know that **If they are bullshitting, Cohen will step in.** Expect to see real progress made.

&#x200B;

Melvin and BoA both have short positions, and are desperately trying to drive the price down. Unfortunately, it is getting harder and harder to convince people that gamestop is a failing business. They are sweating and will continue to sweat. Given the buy side volume, they could close these short positions gradually without triggering a massive squeeze, however it **WILL drive the price up significantly higher than it is now.** 

&#x200B;

Sherman is a clueless boomer who is gonna have his ass handed to him by the younger, smarter, better Ryan Cohen. I mean look at this guy. He's gonna get his ass handed to him and have no clue what's happening. Cohen has a gun to his head and he's sweating. 

[Just look at his face. You can see the fear in his eyes. The fake smile. He is terrified.](https://preview.redd.it/wqrztm3vjn661.png?width=294&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1eaace117ae61da56ef5d741be36d1e05d71246)

Finally, It is likely that GME will more than likely beat earnings next quarter. I won't go into much detail into this because it is not my expertise, however u/Uberkikz11 has done some amazing DD and has been doing so for a long time. This guy literally goes into GameStop stores to get his information. Read this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kh9na8/gme\_4q20\_financial\_model/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kh9na8/gme_4q20_financial_model/)

&#x200B;

Basically, GameStop is a very solid bet. Barring the event of a total market crash and new bullish news, I think it is extremely realistic to hit 17-20 by EOY. Obviously this is a shares play, but for you gamblers, I cant see jan 15 16-20 calls not printing bigly. Long term calls or leaps too. If you're new to gamestop, the volatility will seem scary but the shorts fight hard with this one. -10% days followed by +20% days are not unusual. Fortunately these swings dont burn much theta as they are relatively common and expected.

Let's be real, if he didn't pump steel with such conviction you all would probably be twiddling your thumbs like the retards you are while your weekly PLTR calls consistently fucks you unforgivingly. Now I know most of you here are probably: (1) balls deep in $MegaTendies (and its subsidiary plays); (2) bag holding GME until Melvin and those nerds get squozed; or (3) losing money on $DASH puts and are probably refreshing this sub every 30 second with the *'New Posts'* filter as work begins to pile up at your shitty 9-5 work from home jobs.

Call me the new prophet on the block (or a retard) because you fuckers need to really consider $FCX as the next fucking boomer rocket that's going to lift off into Alpha Centauri and give you the tendies you degenerates don't want to miss out on.

&#x200B;

Read the scriptures below nerds:

&#x200B;

**What the fuck is FCX?**

Freeport-McMoran is one of the largest copper mining firms in the world, and one of the few that are American - operates large, long-lived, geographically diverse assets with significant proven and probable reserves of copper, gold and molybdenum. According to their latest earnings, they generated copper and gold sales 7% above their July estimates. They've reduced their net debt YOY and has been able to maintain a strong and healthy balance sheet over the course of this pandemic.

**Copper**

After a small decline of 0.2% in 2019, world copper mine production, adjusted for historical disruption factors, is expected to decline by about 1.5% in 2020 and then to recover by around 4.5% in 2021:

Copper prices are currently at an all time high (look at chart below) and demand for copper will pick up significantly into 2021 as economies start to recover. Like steel, this is a no brainer cyclical economic crash play, and people will always fucking need copper.

https://preview.redd.it/91u0up2ntk661.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9ed529e67a3c56655ba6c3da2f521da6166e82b

**70% of the world's copper is used in applications that deliver electricity**

* Electric Vehicles (EVs), charging stations, high efficiency motors use roughly **4x more copper** than traditional automobiles
   * We know the EV hype is there and coming into fruition with countries committing to be climate neutral by 20\_\_, there will be even more demand for copper as production ramps up
* Solar panels and associated hardware use copper vs. the traditional fossil fuel power generators
* 5G higher frequency spectrum requires more than 10x the hardware of 4g and there's plenty of associated copper cabling

**Copper supply takes a long time to ramp up (i.e. getting mines approved, excavation, etc)**  and FCX is in the midst of massively ramping its biggest mine which will roughly double output next year.

Copper is used in building construction, power generation and transmission, electronic product manufacturing, and the production of industrial machinery and transportation vehicles. Copper is an essential component in the motors, wiring, radiators, connectors, brakes, and bearings used in cars and trucks.

&#x200B;

**FCX OUTLOOK 2021**

**Volume Growth (2021e v. 2020e)** = Copper 20%+, Gold 70%+ 🚀🚀🚀

**Expanding Margins =** EBITDA/Cash Flows to approximately double in 2021e compared to 2020e  🚀🚀🚀

**Near-term: Laser Focused on Execution** = Continued net debt reduction 🚀🚀🚀🚀

**Sustained growth** in copper demand is expected to continue as **copper is essential to economic activity** and even more so to the modern technological society. Infrastructure development in major countries such as **China and India** and the **global trend towards cleaner energy** will continue to support copper demand. 🚀🚀🚀

RC Ventures raises its GameStop stake to 12.9%. It becomes impossible for Sherman and Friends to dilute his stake below 11.7%,0.98,"1. RC increased his stake at $GME from 6,500,000  shares to 9,001,000, a **38.4% increase in RC's ownership of the company**.
2. In the recent [Q3 conference call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/12/09/gamestop-gme-q3-2020-earnings-call-transcript/), the company said they may sell up to $100 million worth of shares. Everyone knew that was a poison pill intended to dilute RC's stake at the company in case he decided to do a hostile takeover or any other type of intervention.

$100 million at $14-$15 per share would be about 7 million shares, or about a **10% increase in the total number of shares outstanding**.

3. This means that **now it's impossible for Sherman and friends to dilute RC's ownership to a level below 11.7%.**

Calculation:

(RC Share) / (Current Outstanding shares + Max potential shares offered) = 9,001,000 / (69.75M + 7M) = 11.72%

&#x200B;

PS:

Even if the company goes absolutely crazy and sell 20 million new shares, RC's stake would still be 10%:

9,001,000 / (69.75M + 20M) = 10%",2020-12-21 16:58:21

What's more is the statement RC issued in light of the news.

&#x200B;

*RC Ventures intends to continue to engage in discussions with GameStop’s board “regarding means to drive stockholder value, including through changes to the composition of the board and other corporate governance enhancements.""* 

*While RC Ventures “desires to come to an amicable resolution with \[GameStop, it\] will not hesitate to take any actions that it believes are necessary to protect the best interests of all stockholders.”*

The dream was so vivid.

**The open interest on GME 7/16 15p dropped from 54K to 6K last week.** They bought them in early October based on historical open interest / options volumes when the puts were over a $7/premium.

Even if they timed the exact bottom near $12, that's still around a **$25 million realized loss** from all the extrinsic value going to waste. The stock price started rallying up afterwards, so presumably they started covering their shorts too after unloading their puts?

You know what, I think $20 EoY is really happening even if it's only because hedge funds are collecting tax deductions from the losses. Hopefully this doesn't age badly with Monday lol

GME Interesting Squeeze Facts & Market Cap & Future Valuations,0.9,"GME currently sits at a market cap of roughly $1 Billion. ATH was ~$9B cap back in 2007/2008 and a less high ~$6,5B cap in 2013. This would put share price today at $130 and $95 respectively, with the shares outstanding that GameStop currently has (69.75 million). 

For the share price to reach $1000 would ""only"" take a $70B market cap. For reference, other companies with such a market cap include: CSX, CB, BDX, LRCX
Don't know who they are? Neither do I. Boomer companies with large caps.

For a more conservative example, how would a $500 price valuation ($35B cap) look like compared to others in that range? SYY (food distribution), CMG (Chipotle), F (Ford) and EBAY (eBay).

Even comparing to Best Buy ($26B market cap) would already raise share price to $370

If Cohen does a complete turnaround for GameStop and makes it a household name in the gaming industry (something like Steam but EVERYTHING gaming related) then I can see $500 becoming pretty reasonable (might even be low-balling it). However even if he takes over that would be mid- to long-term valuations since it would take quite a bit of work to pull off all the changes. So what are we banking on right now? The positive earnings for Q4 + maybe some Cohen news to get the ball rolling to tendie land and maybe a mild short squeeze to help.

Perhaps. Or maybe there's still *some* chance for an infinity squeeze if MM uses logic.

With the current share price, for Boomer Sherman & Co to issue the shelf order, it would dilute the shares with an additional 6-7 million shares (to get the $100 million worth). However what if they waited for the share to reach obscene heights (say $1000) they would reach their $100 million with only 100k shares. Thus very minimal dilution would occur.

Obviously this has a lot of speculation in it, so don't take what I said too seriously. I mainly wrote this down so I can visualize it better for myself and confirm my own bias that GME is going to the moon.

Oh and fun fact; according to the ownership list for WSB, we own approximately 3.8 Million shares of GameStop, 5.8% or ~$57 million worth of GME (soon to be Billions). 🚀🚀🚀",2020-12-20 11:31:17

> GME has a concentrated short position (BoA, Melvin) against a large number of longs.  1 to 1 short to float ratio.

I'm a three year vet at wall street bets I have 0ed my account twice, watched it go to -90% a couple more times. I marched with my brothers on PLTR, AMD, CRSR, GME earnings and have resurrected my account(except GME). I have seen my account hit 25k and am back to 18k(+150% all time). I will now march again into the darkness to be victorious and make it to tendy town or be slaughtered by the the thousands.

Fundamentals 
Unemployment numbers 
885,000 total vs 808,000 expected
unemployment is simply bad no more needs to be said.

Consumer spending power is going down
Every state is seeing a decline in personal income. This will affect most companies and will lead to unimpressive Christmas sales.

The US dollar is weakening and will only continue on the next Stimulus 

The stimulus
Its underwhelming not sexy at all. Wheres my Trump bucks????????

Countries all over the world are reaching all time highs as their government desperately try to sell their bonds its simply not healthy. 

All the firms know this cannot last there has to be a pull back and when it does they will end richer than they were before. They hold this up by buying stocks. I do not know if they know options exist yet but I hope no one tells them they are doing it wrong.

Technical analysis
This Market has been gapping up in the am only to maintain and live off of the sweet power hour. Good luck finding support on the way down. 

Stay careful out there brothers. Only risk what you are willing to lose.

GME DD crossing the Shermancon edition.,0.92,"We had the pleasure of having [Uberkikz11](/u/Uberkikz11) in for an [interview](https://anchor.fm/modernguilt/episodes/EP27--NEXT-STOP--GAMESTOP-MOON-BASE-ensdq6) and he dropped some good insight that I'll share here on everything Gamestop. Uberkiks11 has done DD so deep that he's basically an oracle at this point so strap in and get ready. I'll try and throw some key points down that I haven't seen covered in a lot of the other Gamestop DD. 

## the GME situation.

It should be no secret by now that people have been shifting away from Brick and Motor retailers and convenience shopping has largely shifted to online. We've all been fudded to death with blockbuster analogies and the rise of online gaming and steam. So why would anyone ever step foot in a Gamestop? 

While true that people are shifting away from standard brick and motor they are also seeking human interaction and experiential retail experiences. Part of the Sherm overhaul is specifically focusing on making these stores hubs to get expert knowledge from, and talk shit about peoples favorite games. 

You know who loves to hang out in stores and endlessly talk about fantasy worlds with clerks and then spend money? Gamers, the lonely and Otakus all of which were packing out a local EB games (NZ Gamestop) and it was packed not only with people buying games but verbally shitposting at the clerks about the finer points of the Halo nerf gun and its accuracy compared to the game, which frankly as bullish as all the people walking out of there with EB game bags. 

Over this side of the world our internet can be a little shithouse some times as well. To the point that if you are trying to download a game that is unironically 90GBs it can take 2 days and blow your entire internet cap. This demographic is a lot larger then you think as most people don't have the patience or time to wait for the latest game hot the market. So no people are not going to be only downloading through online stores quite just yet. Also gamers love to show their collection. Its a mark of pride to show the your evolution and lineage from the first disk of Crash Bandicoot to your modern day COD collection. 

Another addition I haven't seen mentioned in any recent DD is that the new PS5 only has 667GBs of storage. That is absolutely not hard to pack out with a few modern games and the ability to have more storage is disabled, to be [enabled on a future update](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551165/sony-ps5-playstation-5-no-m2-ssd-expansion-launch).

## okay but what about the massive amount of losses?

Part of these losses was writing off GOODWILL which is comprised of intangible assets which essentially means THEY DIDN'T LOSE ANYWHERE NEAR AS MUCH ACTUAL DOLLARS. They were writing off the fact they pissed their customers off and drove the brand name into the mud. So it is entirely likely they can return to profitability and soon after and its worth remembering that even a hateful emotional attachment is top of mind when stuck at 57.4 GB. Don't be fooled by the sly bear saying the company is going bankrupt they have more then enough cash to see them through until Sherms strategy plays itself out or they eventually kick him out for failing at his job. 

## But what about the revenue miss and the stores closing how can that possibly be bullish? or how I learned to stop worrying and love Sherman.

Prior to shutting the stores GME was everywhere and had infested malls to the point of absurd inefficiency. There was a point where within the small mall there were multiple gamestops that were essentially competing with each other. As it is physical stores are ridiculously expensive to run. A good action to take in when you have too many stores and there is a shift online would be to close down unneeded stores and focus more on online shopping. And guess what? Thats exactly what the Sherm omniclose strat is all about. That's why when people say that closing 1000 stores is bullish, that while yes it will drop revenue, it will also allow Gamestop to focus more intently on profitable stores and Ecommerce. 

Then there is the shift towards a greater product line like console accessories, gaming headsets and focused advertising. This is part of building an experiential service that will be a league against companies like amazon that can't customize for hardcore gamers who lets face it are fanatics when it comes to their genre of choice. Despite Sherms shitty corporate speak they are actually somewhat following Cohens letter just on Boomer time. 

## Beyond the Cohen rainbow

We should all be aware of Cohen at this point. But there are actually more big dogs then Cohen and Burry betting that GME is going to turn around. What I've seen missing is Daniel Foss the billionaire and Senvest who ""employs a contrarian, value-based investment strategy "" or specialize in underdogs due for a comeback. Why would they do that? because they also see the big opportunity of a Gamestop turn around with sensible fiscal management and a turn towards being a multi product eCommerce store. So you're not alone in your holdings and its backed by some very big players in the game. 

## Where this leaves us?

So even ignoring the Ryan Cohen X factor, the short squeeze, and the other X factors this stock is a total value play. There is some much more detailed posts out there, notably the [infinity war](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4csaa/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century_part/) post that dives into the numbers also worth a look at is [Uberkikz11](/u/Uberkikz11) profile and associated accounts you can find on his profile. The additional X factors that could take this from a strong value play to an actual lottery ticket is Cohen and the infamous short squeeze but thats a story for another day. 

The Tl:dr is People still buy physical games, PS5 has limited space so yes physical disks aren't going away this console cycle. GME is shifting into bigger product categories, and they are backed by serious money. If you want to listen to Uberkiks11 go further into depth into the history of GME and the intricacies of this play you can listen and frankly do a much better job then this rough summary you can hear him in [full here](https://anchor.fm/modernguilt/episodes/EP27--NEXT-STOP--GAMESTOP-MOON-BASE-ensdq6)

"Ackman, Cohen, and Takeover Strategy",0.92,"Right, I know we're all bored to fucking sleep regarding the number of GME posts, so thought I'd make another.

Everyone who tuned into the earnings call last week was annoyed that GME management did not even comment on Cohen's now-infamous letter. However, listening to Ackman talking about activist investing at [6:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGatQk1JSas&t=420s) does shed a bit of light onto why this is. 

Ackman says that often companies will refuse to comment on activist investor requests. If the management directly comments on a proposal, then event-driven investors (like 90% of the autists here) will buy in in droves. If this happens and there is a proxy contest down the line, the activist investor will win as he/she will be backed by the event-driven investors. i.e. George Sherman didn't comment on Cohen, as he doesn't want to lose his job.

Anyone with half a brain cell probably realised from the earnings call, especially with the option for GME to issue more shares, that they are scared of a takeover. That's why we heard 'omnichannel' a trillion times, to suggest that GME are shifting to e-commerce without directly talking about Cohen's strategy.

Lastly, it has been noted here a few times that GME won't need to use the shelved shares. Gamestop is currently sitting on $500 million cash and so just don't need the extra capital. They will only exercise the right if they spot a Cohen hostile takeover, meaning it won't affect the share price greatly. 

Remember it's also Q4 earnings, not Q3, that matter.

How bullish 0% interest rate world really is - Answer: VERY BULLISH,0.93,"Good evening legends,

The following post will be brief. This post will setup my framework and over the next few days I'm going to be posting my DDs on the stocks I've invested in if there is interest.

# TLDR: I am FULLY SENDING IT - below is WHY.

**Aphorism 1:** ""STONKS only go up"" - WSB legends

* I am a true believer of things improving over time. My plays are stocks and leaps due to tax advantages and frankly the humility that came along with trying to time the top/bottom and failing on multiple occasions.

**Aphorism 2:** ""History doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes."" - Mark Twain

* What are the top 3 countries with the lowest interest rates?
   * Switzerland: maintained the same interest rate for the last five years. Annualized return of EWL ETF over those 5 years? 10% with 61% total return.
   * Denmark: maintained 0% to negative \~1% interest rate for the last five years. Annualized return of EDEN ETF over those 5 years? 12.78% with 82.43% total return.
   * Japan: has been fucked for a long time, everybody knows it. EVENTHOUGH FUCKED - annualized return of EWJ over the past 5 years? 8.22% with 48.46% total return.
* The Federal Reserve indicates it will not raise rates for years. It will leave the interest rates around 0% until 2023. What does this mean? Long equity, any equity and if you want to short something don't short fucking TESLA short BANKS. My favorite bank to short is Goldman Sachs, because I like Bernard Baruch not a retard that calls himself DJ Sol.

**Aphorism 3:** ""The odds are either 100% or 0%, and we just don't know which."" - one of my legendary friends

* The fundamental risk at the moment is, the FED's statement of keeping interest rates low is not binding. I am betting that they will stay at 0% but again the statement is NOT BINDING.

GME entry,0.95,"So, I know there's a bunch of autists that FOMOed into this at $18.

But, if anyone was looking for an entry, this is a good point.  If there is short covering, and I think there's been a very healthy amount for 4 trading days straight (short to total volume hovering between 25-31%, which is very low), they are running out of shares to cover with, and there is still a massive amount of short interest (I put the total 4 day decline in SI at roughly 15%, if I were to guess, using back-of-the-envelope math).

Volume today is low.  They will have to start going higher to find shares to bring in.

Paper hands have largely all sold now.  Look for this to return to $14 in the short to medium term, as shorts will need to move higher to find new sellers.

Avoid the options unless you're dating them out to mid next year, at least, *and* you also plan on exiting the position by late January, as it will be very difficult to overcome the IV and theta.

Of course, this is all predicated on no new information about Cohen's involvement.

Gonna describe the second graph and this applies to the first one two. Basically what I think will happen to game leading up to march and post march has happend twice, albeit with a failing buisness in 2013. The shorts increase their positions. In both massive peaks in the stock price their was a new console cycle. Now with closing unprofitable stores and increasing the eccomerce, revenue is lower but MARGINS are higher. the shorters are well above 100% in relation to the outstanding share count, the price is currently in discount zone, and calls are cheap and puts are getting expensive. The fair price of GME based on FCF is around $22, and all this paired  with stimulus and vaccine news and the biggest console cycle in US history could be a big enough catalyst that the share price rises enough to start a feedback loop of margin calls and hence a massive squeeze.",2020-12-14 19:21:39

1. VLDR deliver long range sensor technologies for cars. This is relevant since we are indeed looking at a future where cars will be self-driven, and sensors is a very important part of ADAS (Automatic driving assistant system).

2. Amazons new auto-drive Taxi (zoox) uses Velodyne’s technology-sensors. Which will likely be in production in the next three years.

[Also, look at the sensors the car is using, definitly Velodyne sensors](https://preview.redd.it/d25w1n3vd7561.jpg?width=1557&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bda35586d2f50d67340fb49f3cafbcac473b5159)

GME Bull run thesis explained and why it should interest you. rokit rokit mun,0.92,"Okay, good morning fellow autists and retards. 

I'm not going to bother with the niceties since most of you have the attention span of a pre-teen needing to go potty. That's not a lot so I'll keep it brief.

&#x200B;

GME is a B&M primary business, first and foremost. It operates mainly in the US, though it also has retail stores in Canada, Europe, New Zealand and Australia. They used to be wildly popular back in the day, but have seen rapid decline since the digitization era has come and GME for the most part hasn't been adapting as it should have been.   


This brings us to today, where the share price has been averaging down for years, until mid-August this year when we got the news of the [partnership with Microsoft](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-surges-after-microsoft-partnership-announcement-2020-10-08#:~:text=GME%2C%20%2D5.74%25%20gained%2044,end%20and%20in%2Dstore%20operations), which sent the price to tendie-town for those who got in early. However, based on purely DCF, a fair value for the stock would be around 22 USD. Way higher than what it's now, and that's also the difference between Burry and Cohen imo. Burry invested purely on the fair value for GME, while Cohen has different intentions (more on that later).

Now, a partnership is great, but it won't keep them afloat forever. They NEED to change their boomer mentality and start getting digitized. Gaming is a booming sector, [with insane growth YOY.](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/video-game-market#:~:text=The%20global%20video%20game%20market,12.9%25%20from%202020%20to%202027.&text=The%20rising%20inclination%20from%20physical,on%20hardware%20compatibility%20and%20efficiency) They need to capitalize on this or they'll flicker out eventually because someone else came around and filled the void. 

This is where Ryan Cohen comes in. No need to introduce him, this guy has been mentioned enough, founded CHEWY made millions, etc. What hasn't been sent home enough, is that he has vision. He knows what people want, how they want to be treated as customers ([which is in part why CHWY has such good reputability](https://www.forbes.com/sites/veronikasonsev/2018/05/23/chewys-customers-love-them-and-heres-why/?sh=58b595244b7f)). 

What the gaming industry lacks is a centralized point that makes people go ""Oh yeah, I need this or that game, let's go to Gamestop for that"" There really isn't that one name for people. It used to BE Gamestop with them even now still being the largest gaming retailer in America. But they're but a shadow of what they have been. 

Now if anyone has been able to follow me through my ramblings, Ryan Cohen has in front of him an opportunity to pull GME up from the mud and reveal a diamond. Because that what GME is. A diamond in the rough, and no one's noticed, or bothered to check it out. 

Now I don't know how, or when exactly, there are plenty of other posts that go into the when and how Cohen will take over, but all I do know is this:

\-He bought up 9.98% of the shares outstanding (massive position)

\-He ([or his lawyer](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kakxrm/gme_tribe_a_story_about_how_ryan_cohen_is_about/)) wrote an unusually aggressive letter to the BoD to change pretty massively. 

\-He's mentioned in interviews that he doesn't like to half-ass investments if he [""believes in the company""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJdZPTjq274). 

&#x200B;

What does this say for me? That he believes in the company, not so much in the current way that its heading (hence the letter). His stake in the company tells me he's not just a friendly passer-by telling them to look-up because a meteorite is about to smash into them. No, he's putting his foot in the door so that he can then open it wide and let in some fresh air (himself/his team). 

Not only would it change the entire company in a good way, it would make any sort of valuation unpredictable taking into account future potential. 

Add on to this situation that GME is so heavily shorted, and this makes for a SUPER interesting play, if not long-term, at the very least short-term, because of the short squeeze that would occur because of this. And if Cohen takes over, long term prospects are probably higher than whatever we get from the squeeze. 

I don't know if much of what I said made sense, but here you go anyway. My 2 cents.

GME: personal experience today,0.97,"I was out xmas shopping today and went in to a GME seeing as so I'm a part owner lmao (actually, it was the New Zealand brand EB Games which Cohen would foresee closing - i hope he instead sets up E-commerce in the Australia and NZ markets.  Also, NZ has no covid so can shop safely without masks etc). 

Anyway, I think I see exactly what Cohen sees in GME; it's a gaming culture brand for consoles and PCs that also serves fandom merch. It just works cause there's nothing like it in the market. It's a fun place and a good brand. It's one of the only places where everything is kinda fun and as a huge pokemon fan, im not really served otherwise except for target clones which draws the life out of you shopping in. 

The good news was the console sales. I chatted to a rep acting interested in a ps5. She told me there is a backlog of PS5s and Xboxs. NZ will prob get 10k max at EB games then will have to wait for the next shipment. I cannot order a PS5 until January and even then March and April is more likely. Shit is real. And EB Games (GME) is seen as a market leader in the NZ market. She said xbox didnt even have a date in nz. Gotta love hype. 

Im buying more of this dip. Have a Wendy's worker's size of stock atm.

Tl;dr: GME plays a key role in the console market. I stand with Cohen's vision.",2020-12-13 05:42:53
Someone please explain to me why I would not use poor mans covered calls for theta gang?,0.87,"Lets take the following scenario:  


* I have 12.2k account balance
*  I am trading APPL
* AAPL is trading at 122.00/share

&#x200B;

If i wanted to do normal covered calls for this week, I'd do something like the following:  


* Buy 100 shares of AAPL at current price (122)
* sell a 18DEC 124C (current price 1.25)
* assuming AAPL doesn't move above 124, profit $125 from the 12.2k investment 

&#x200B;

If i am understanding poor mans covered calls correctly, I'd do something like the following:  


* Buy 4 16JUL2021 100C at current price (27.3)
* sell 4  18DEC 127C at current price using long calls as collateral at current price 0.5
* assuming AAPL doesn't moon this week, short calls expire worthless, profit $200 from the 12.2k investment 

&#x200B;

Now I know I have to be missing something here,  because this seems like it's just too easy as long as you're not doing this with the likes of GME and NKLA. The only downside seems to be if there's a significant crash in the underlying (eg AAPL suddenly drops to 110 and doesnt recover before the long calls expire), you're effectively making the % returns based on the premium of the long call rather than the actual share price (0.5/27.3 vs 1.25/124). 

&#x200B;

so even if I can afford 100 shares of a company to do covered calls, why would I do that instead of PMCC? what am I missing?

Edit: gotcha. Seems like the downside is you lose the safety net of traditional wheeling where if the underlying tanks enough, you can still have shares vs PMCC potentially getting wiped out on both legs if the underlying crashes hard enough.",2020-12-13 02:17:43

TSLA to the moon! Part 1 (the non DD),0.83,"Alright ladies, boys, Bulls, and bears alike,

I've went ahead and took a good chunk of money and margin and done what we do best. ALL ON PAPA ELON.

Let me set the stage for you-->

I'm balls deep in TSLA calls, one sweet SPY put and you know damn straight I'm GME gang till I fucking die. #WEWANTCOHEN

Here's the spread:

TSLA:

12/18 $450 call +3

12/18 $610 call +2

12/24 $545 call +1

12/24 $520 call +1

1/15 $500 call +2

9/16/22 $300 call +1

SPY:

12/28 $335 put +23

Now I pull out my massive paintbrush. This is how I see it, it literally CAN NOT GO TITS UP. (Famous last words? TBD). there's 3  likely outcomes.

\#1. \[75% chance dubbed the Baseline\] Due to the massive demand from benchmark funds and tracking funds alike having to buy a little over 164 MILLION SHARES Tesla fucking skyrockets to 750 minimum by Friday 12/18. ( A 23.1527% increase) I sell everything friday, Take my money and leave the poker table  after calling their bluffs, \*cough pussies cough\*, and head over to and put it all on black GME for the win. (long fucking wait though its going to be bouncing around till April). Oh also the Spy calls expire worthless, but in reality who gives a fuck?

\#2. \[12.5% chance dubbed the Black swan\] Due to some unforeseen event. Tesla tanks despite the massive demand and buying pressure leading into Friday the 18th, but somehow the general market is largely unaffected and doesn't trigger my 8% hail merry FT(motherfucking)W spy puts and I lose everything. I then look longing at the closet, as i open the door to see my day 1, $rope, and flip a coin to see if today is the day.

\#3\[12.5% chance dubbed the golden goose\] Due to unforeseen event the psychology of the market takes a massive shit on itself from rebalancing portfolios and algorithmic bot traders proceed to shit the bed and dump all other stocks besides tesla and the market sees a massive +10% drop while TSLA, un wavered by the fools who thought technology could save it reaches to Mars because the moon was just too damn close. This triggers not only my spy puts raking in boat loads of cash but also sending my TSLA shares and options threw the proverbial roof. I also sell here and go see my boy #WEWANTCOHEN and proceed to take over the Gamestop board to help captain turn this bitchin' ship around.

So 1) Tesla's meteoric rise is taken into account. 2) if i shit the bed or market tanks and effects tesla i still profit. and 3) there's always the good ol' $Rope theory i hear so much about. I Literally cant see how this can all go tits up. With impending government lockdowns, fed programs ending, Jpow turning the printer off, the stimulus on hold, and all eviction memorandums coming up the end of December, its looking really good for a nice lil correction.

Now, i know what you fucktards are going to say. ""why so deep in the money? if you believe TSLA is hitting 700 minimum Friday, why so much capital upfront?""

Answer: Because all of this isn't just for fun, i like to manage my risk. Because WINNING is much more important to me than loss porn. if any issues see Link #3.

or Maybe the good old ""why are you buying so many different strikes?""

answer: different strikes bought on different days and different accounts and I'm still learning/adapting.

I'm going to do the DD post with the same name and tittle is part [2. So](https://2.So) am i missing anything?

TLDR: TSLA GO MARS FRIDAY. HOLD CALLS TILL FRIDAY. GROFIT.

EDIT: thanks to u/psycobusa who brought up an excellent point on my second post, and i did some research it seems if you have any 12/18 calls they will expire worthless seeing as how the funds usually buy AFTER MARKET CLOSE on the day they have to add(thats friday)! (those fuckers). SO i will be rolling my 12/18 calls to 12/24 to profit and hopefully the dump monday morning isn't too bad so i can get mine off at 9:30 sharp!

* Only 8% of respondents sold (possible selection bias)
* On average, respondents increased shares by 12%
* 98% of respondents would support Ryan Cohen in replacing the board of directors. 2% were not sure, 0% would keep the existing board

Introducing WSB Roulette! Randomly generated options plays because this is a casino!,0.98,"**Intro**

I'd like to present my latest waste of time, WSB Roulette! Since logic no longer applies with trading in 2020, why not let RNGesus help? This is a quick python script I put together that takes a list of tickers and generates some random options to help you lose your money without guilt. If you lose money with these trades, you can blame RNG instead of yourself! If you're feeling even more adventurous, there's an FD mode too!

**DISCLAIMER**

This script is purely for entertainment purposes and I will be not responsible for any losses your retarded plays get you!!


**How it works**  
More details available in the README in the Github repo, but here's the gist of it. You feed it a list of tickers you want to ""invest"" in. For each one, it randomly decides whether to make a call/put, selects a random expiration date and strike price and returns the relevant data. The script uses a library that uses the Yahoo Finance API for data which is limited to 1000 API calls per hour per IP address.

Activating FD mode restricts the returned options to those that are <2 weeks and 3-5 strikes OTM only. Otherwise by default, you have a chance of OTM, ATM, and ITM  options.

**Setup and Usage**  
You'll need Python 3.6+ installed. Download requirements.txt and wsbroulette.py from the Github repo. Open a command prompt, navigate to the directory you downloaded the files and install the requirements using

    pip install -r requirements.txt    

Script Usage:

    python wsbroulette.py -t TICKERS -b BALANCE [-e EXPIRATION RANGE] [-s STRIKE_RANGE] [-d DISTRIBUTION] [-f] [-beargang] [-bullgang]

Enter the list of tickers in parantheses and seperated by commas. Ex. ""TSLA,GME,ROPE""

Balance is the maximum amount of $ you want to spend

EXPIRATION_RANGE is optional and controls what the maximum number of expiration dates are returned (Default = 4)

STRIKE_RANGE is optional and controls the range of strikes returned from the current underlying price (Default = 3)

DISTRIBUTION is optional and controls the randomness of allocation of funds between the tickers (Lower is more random, Higher is more even, Default = 10)

Add the -f flag if you want to engage FD mode! In FD mode, only the next 2 expiration dates are used. Options are also always OTM at 3-5 strikes out from underlying.

Add either the -beargang or -bullgang flag if you want to only generate puts or calls, respectively



**Example Usage**

    python wsbroulette.py -t ""TSLA,PLTR,GME,NIO"" -b 50000 -e 2 -s 5

This generates 4 options for TSLA, PLTR, GME, NIO with a total bankroll of up to $50,000. It will only use up to the next 2 expirations because FDs are life. The strike price will be in the range of +/- 5 strikes from the current underyling price.

    python wsbroulette.py -t ""TSLA,PLTR,GME,NIO"" -b 50000 -f

FD MODE! Generate 4 options for TSLA, PLTR, GME, NIO with a bankroll of $50k. Options are OTM, expire within 2 weeks and are 3-5 strikes out.

They used to give these loans to each other, but the process became fucked up and expensive and the FED stepped in to fix this by offering the loans themselves at a low rate.  Once the pandemic hit, they took the unprecedented step of offering the loans with zero additional interest for themselves, basically offering free money.
[‘0 basis points over IOER’ is nerd speak for ‘fucking free money’](https://i.imgur.com/tD780yn.jpg)
**-Did it work?  Yes.**  
Fed Policy typically takes a couple of months to affect the market.  With that in mind, you can see that the performance of SPY correlates with the interest rate and bid volume on overnight repo operations.  Free money policy was instituted in March, and the impact gained full strength in the spring.
[look at this insane Repo activity in early June when the loans were free money. SPY was +7% month to date!](https://i.imgur.com/3bwjqd5.jpg)

**Treasuries** 
I won't go too deep into treasury purchases and its effect on market activity, but the simplified version is this; **if the FED needs to flood the market with money by pushing people to invest in vehicles aside from safe, boomer treasuries, they will buy up the treasuries themselves.**  This raises the price of treasuries by starving the market, thus giving them less yield--in other words, making them less valuable.  With less yield, people turn to stocks.  That's an oversimplified version of how it works, but you get the gist; the FED buys treasuries so people buy stonks.
**-Did it work? Yes**.
Take a look at the yield rate on treasuries here.  [At this time in 2019, the 20 year yield was up as high as 2.2%](https://i.imgur.com/1fLBbE3.jpg).  But, take a look at what happens after March.  The Fed begins buying up the treasuries, and the yield goes down to .98 in April.  All you need to know is that means the yield on treasuries was dogshit so people were pressured to buy stonks.
""How do you know this was the Fed's doing?""
They said it.  [Here is one of many statements from the FED](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_200312a) saying ""we are going to by the fuck out of treasuries at an increased rate because of COVID"".  How increased?  Take a look at this photo, we are talking about an average of 10 or 20 billion dollars, to 80 million dollars a clip.
[treasury spending increased 3 fold](https://i.imgur.com/J08Av7D.jpg)

**Bond Repurchases**
In March the FED announced they would be buying corporate bonds in another major boost to available liquidity.  Just as SPY got shaky, it was an added boost immeditely after the June  crash (a crash, btw, caused by a change in the repo loan interest rates).  Basically, when large companies need money they issue bonds to shore up cash that are available to the public (same shit as treasuries, basically)--the FED is now buying those bonds.  This direct infusion of cash from the FED is about as close to outright buying stock in companies as you can get.
**Did it work? Yes**. 
See: June rebound.  Also google some of the types of companies they're buying bonds from.  There's a reason why the fact that nobody is paying rent hasn't caused a mortgage-backed credit crisis for major banks...yet.

*So, weve established the main tools the FED uses to prop up the market and that they work.  What’s the problem, and why am I saying JPOW has forsaken us?*

**Because the Fed’s balance sheet has been contracting, and with that these programs are no longer offering nearly as favorable terms as they once were, but the market isn’t strong enough to handle those unfavorable terms.**

[here’s a graph from the FED showing their flatlining balance sheet](https://i.imgur.com/CoRcfBb.jpg)
The FED is spending less overall than it was earlier this year (remember, it takes a couple months for spending policy to catch up in the market).  *This was bound to happen, but the problem is the key programs I mentioned are all at obviously ineffective levels and haven’t been increased.* PROBABLY BECAUSE NOBODY COUNTED ON THE SECOND COVID SURGE DESTROYING PROGRESS IN EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS. 
**a) Repo operations haven’t been the zero-cost interest level since July**, moving from +0 basis points over the standard interest rate, to +5--and on longer term loan operations +10.  The market has not responded kindly to losing their free money, looking at the monthly SPY charts.
**b) While generous, the treasuries purchases have stalled out at 80 million**.  More importantly, the FED hasn't facilitated any key changes to which terms they purchase (long v short, etc). The market has responded to this stagnation with stagnation, looking at the monthly SPY charts.
**c) Bond purchases not set to increase**: The FED is still purchasing bonds, but have also stagnated the rates of that along with the other two facilities.  Kaplan, the Dallas Fed Chair who's always running his mouth, has [indicated a lack of support for increased corporate bond purchases. ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/kaplan-says-hes-not-in-favor-of-fed-increasing-bond-purchases.html)

**What the contracting FED balance sheet, the stagnation of these increased liquidity programs, and the lackluster performance of SPY over the past three months combine to signal is that the market/SPY is NOT healthy enough on its own to continue its rise.  Sure there will be good days, I even have a 267 exiting Monday, but the absurd gravy train of June-August is no more. If you take the 5 day election bump out the picture, SPY has performed over 50% less than its aggregrate performance April-August.**

Why did I say don't buy the dip YET? Is help coming?  Yes.  Two potential ways:
**1) The stimulus**: if enhanced UI benefits are improved, the spending in the consumer goods and credit market would provide a huge boost that could offset the economic effects of an increasingly bleek jobs situation.

**2) The FOMC meeting on the 16th**: this is where the FED would make any decisive changes on the lending programs mentioned here.  My guy /u/curiousmaniac pointed out to me that these changes, if they even happened, likely wouldn't come to fruition in the new year (even if the policy is changed on the 16th).

**So yeah, you might wanna chill on SPY. I hear you saying “where was this BEFORE TODAY?! REVISIONIST HISTORY”**
-[here's my DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9zcbo/why_the_market_is_becoming_the_economy_a_tale_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) from  last week calling the top of SPY at 370

Other than that, monthly stimulus plays that favor consumer spending (on places that are at an advantage from hybrid online/retail models due to lockdown), TOL (housing numbers explode when stimmy passes), and TDOC because TDOC is dope. 

**WMT: 1/8 155c**

**TDOC 1/15 205c**
**AAPL: 1/8 126c**
**HPQ: 1/15 25c**
**TOL 1/15 46c**


**TLDR**: FED tools are drying up, SPY is too dangerous for now--market isn't strong enough on its own yet.  Count on monthlies that are a hybrid of pandemic retail/online winners in preparation for the stimulus, and pay attention the results of FOMC meeting on the 16th.  VXX sucks and I'm using TLT as a hedge.

TL:DR ALL IN GME

GME earnings was largely a bull case for those following WSB's DD, but we've seen shares slide down. One of the main reasons is the potential dilution of shares from the shelf offering. People have explained that it's an offering of $100mil worth of shares, not actually 100mil shares but no one gave any numbers. Turns out I'm the only one out here with a TI-84 Plus CE. 

Based on the market cap before earnings call and a conservative estimate of 10mil shares offered at $10 share price.

16.94 x 69750000 / 79750000 = 14.82 (2d.p)

Based on share dilution alone, the stock would only dip to 14.82 on very conservative assumptions.

After receiving requests for an update, I decided to conduct a second survey to find out how people reacted to GME Q3 earnings. This survey is mainly for those who responded to the first survey before Q3 earnings. Only entries where the ID matches an ID from the first survey will be counted. Any significant increases in shares need to be confirmed via DM screenshot.

The preliminary results from the post-earnings responses to the first survey are extremely bullish. Almost everyone follow Buffett's advice to BTFD (or BTD, F):

**Response**|**Users**|**Pre-Earnings Shares**|**Post-Earnings Shares**|**% Change**
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:
Buy|20|13,074|23,596|80%

Sell|1|67|0|-100%
**Total**|**22**|**13,341**|**23,796**|**78%**

It's a small and probably biased sample: the only ones updating their responses are those who added more shares. That's why we need the second survey.

"GME: Bull case vs bear case, from both perspective",0.96,"This is a post I wrote before earnings. 
🌈 m's banned me for a DD that was short but actually made money for those who followed it. 

Have a read you all.

Seeing that a significant interest has developed around the fabled GME short squeeze, I have written this post and I hope this writing provides an overview of the situation.

# The case for a squeeze:

The entire argument for a short squeeze hinges on the possibility that either the management agrees with Ryan Cohen's [plan](https://archive.is/qUm5s) and addresses it or he decides to pursue a hostile takeover.

**In this spirit, we urge you to quickly provide stockholders with a credible and publicly-available roadmap for cost containment, prioritizing profitable retail locations and geographic markets, and building the e-commerce ecosystem gamers deserve.** (from the letter)

This is Ryan Cohen's plan in its most raw form. Or to put it more simply, he wants GameStop to become the ultimate destination for gamers by leveraging its 55 million PowerUp members, its brand power; reducing lossmaking operations in Europe and Australia and to make investments in a Chewy like website for gaming.

Has management been doing anything? Yes. A lot.

[It's hiring talents for building a successful online gaming store.](https://careers.gamestop.com/en-US/search?keywords=&location=Grapevine,Texas,USA&placeid=ChIJX6Af7HUqTIYRDS8xoHABMCw&facetcitystate=grapevine,tx) [Entered into a multi-year revenue-sharing agreement with Microsoft.](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/)

It has also received a saving grace by the newest console cycle in which some people thought(like me) diskless gaming is going to be the leader. But the reality turned out to be [quite the opposite.](https://www.pcmag.com/news/report-only-25-percent-of-ps5-pre-order-stock-is-cheaper-digital-edition)

Add to that, the Nintendo Switch sold like wildfire in the US and is going strong, you have a winning combination for GameStop which would likely result in good quarters for the coming quarters.

Management has also started a rebranding effort with some changes being made to its logo, items that are kept in-store and online etc.

It seems like management is likely to address Cohen's concern and the lifeline it has received or will be receiving from the newest console could be its saving grace. If it can turn around or the management gives guidance that it CAN turn around its business model a short squeeze is imminent.

Why would it be inevitable?

[Notice that short interest is almost 3 times higher than its float and more than outstanding shares,](https://imgur.com/a/O3uggvr)

GME as a company is still relatively undervalued (assuming it doesn't go under). If the shorts realize that this company is not going to 0 as they have probably assumed, they will be forced to cover their shorts.

The above-mentioned condition of short interest would guarantee that they have to cover. Also considering the average daily volume, this squeeze can last much longer(3-4 days may be) than the other historical squeezes like Volkswagen short squeeze [when it became the most valuable company in the world for a short while.](https://archive.is/0sDgO)

But given that the scenario surrounding GME is unprecedented, there is no telling how it could end up other than to say that it will be MASSIVE.

[Some shorts are already under water.](https://imgur.com/a/86cGFUl) Some of them are likely covering as noted by various Redditors and retail investors who are looking at the stock tick by tick. Also considering that short interest rose to a whopping 309.83% and is now down to 297.13% (as of this writing from Morningstar data), it's obvious that some of it were covered.

The recent stock price appreciation could be a result of that plus the expectation of good quarterly earnings report.

**Retail mania:** There is considerable retail interest in this stock. Considering that this stock is being heavily promoted in [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets) and driven by that a lot of people are buying shares. According to a survey conducted there(not that reliable, but a good indicator of interest), that subreddit alone has enough ownership to get a board seat.

Open Interest in call options is also [huge](https://imgur.com/a/UvxIGqt) considering that this is only a $1B market cap company. It's filled to the brim with OTM call options(from December 4 to April and further). And market makers and option sellers would have to hedge to serve this crowd, in turn increasing the stock price.

This, in turn, could create a feedback loop where the shorts have to cover their positions, leading to a further increase in stock price, which would force market makers to purchase more shares which could increase stock price and on and on until it triggers a squeeze of epic proportion.

**Likely improving financial health:** [GME announced voluntary redemption of senior notes.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2124246/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Voluntary-Early-Redemption-of-Senior-Notes.html) Management has decided to redeem $125M of its senior notes. This is signalling that the company has managed to generate enough cash flow to cover its debt early.

It could even help improve its credit rating which would help it attract institutional investors more and other perks that come with improved credit ratings.

[Declining debt](https://imgur.com/a/G518yz8) is necessary as it would ultimately help deleverage the company and put it in a more sustainable footing which is ultimately what is needed for avoiding bankruptcy.

**Technical analysis:** This is not my forte. I have bare-bones knowledge in TA and only use it for entry and exit purposes.

But according to some retail investors in Reddit and tradingview GME has formed [a cup and handle bullish pattern](https://imgur.com/a/gj9pzZS).

**Analyst Upgrades:** Analysts are upgrading GME stock. Well, that's good, I guess.

# The Case For Bankruptcy

The scenario in which a short squeeze doesn't occur is PROBABLY the scenario in which GME ultimately faces bankruptcy.

As the thesis for short squeeze is laid out, the thesis for the short sellers is also crystal clear.

After all, GME is STILL a large brick and mortar store that is trying to sell a product that could be very easily purchased using the power of the internet.

The revenue of GameStop for the past few quarters is in [steep decline.](https://imgur.com/a/mTcwpIe) The company is overly leveraged and has many stores that are loss-making operations.

Its online store has much lower visibility and investment and is lacking in many aspects(in my personal view).

Its credit rating is not that good and Cohen himself somewhat criticised the management for trying to hang on to its old ways of doing things.

Gaming and associated products are bound to [thrive and grow at a CAGR of 9% and had grown even more in the past.](https://www.reportlinker.com/p05903704/Gaming-Industry-Growth-Trends-and-Forecast.html)

Yet GameStop FAILS to capitalize on this trend and is continuously losing market share while destroying its [financials.](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/gme/financials) This is a clear sign that something is inherently broken within the company.

While the management does seem to be trying to fix things, it could prove to be too little too late.

To change its fortune it needs to turn around its business models like Best Buy or Walmart. Yet it seems pretty unfeasible judging by its financials.

GameStop had adequate time to change with the times and become an early adopter but its backwards-looking culture and late entry made its journey full of competition.

Short sellers believe that ultimately GameStop wouldn't be able to achieve a business turnaround and gain a critical mass of customers in its online space and management incompetency will ultimately lead to its bankruptcy. Thus its faith would be like the numerous mom and pop shops or the various retail giants that were.

Even if GME share rises due to retail mania and market maker hedging; institutional investor ownership could [decline](https://imgur.com/a/04i3a0g), leaving retail investors as the ultimate bagholders. The shorts may bite their tongue and keep on paying interest as long as they believe no fundamental change in the business is going to happen.

Which means they may not need to cover their position as long as the company becomes bankrupt, thus the fabled short squeeze may never materialize.

After all, most shorts are probably institutional investors like Melvin Capital who can always maintain their margin requirements and like the retail investors they can also figure out what the retail investors are trying to do and thus avoid triggering any short squeeze.

They may think, well, game sales are slowly becoming more and more digital, ultimately, platform holders wouldn’t give a shit if GME died and die they will. Because the most lucrative part of GME's business is buying and selling old games. So this will ultimately die.

Plus, game related merchandize and other products(which are very lucrative and a huge market) would still remain under the clout of Amazon, Walmart etc, so GME will not be able to survive through that business model.

# Conclusion

The next two or three quarters are pivotal for GME.

    If
    ""Management decides to address Cohen's concerns and manages to show their roadmap to success and improves its financials within the next two quarters = Short squeeze""
    
    Else If
    ""Cohen declares hostile takeover or something close to that line= Short squeeze""
    
    Else If
    ""Management addresses Cohen but fails to deliver within the next two quarters and has disappointing earnings=Unsure"" #improbable cause next two quarters are expected to be good or at least the guidance which is more important
    
    Else If
    ""Management doesn't fully address Cohen's concern, Cohen also doesn't make any move yet the business improves still= Likely short squeeze""
    
    Else If
    ""Management fails to address Cohen's concern, Cohen disassociates himself, business fundamentals detoriorate= Retail bagholders""
    
    Else
    ""I don't know really, imagine your own scenario, you are not bound to my conclusions. In fact my conclusions could be entirely off the mark. We are trying to predict the future here. Hope you come to your own conclusions. :)

There are various nuances that I avoided writing(which are probably even more important to write) cause it might have taken too much of my time. Writing this post was a good exercise for me and I decided to ride on the GME train after doing so. Before you decide to do anything, you should do your research. This is not financial advice.

What would it look like if Ryan Cohen tried to take over GME (GME porn with STORY inside),0.95,"Been running through this thought experiment wondering what to look out for if Ryan Cohen ever tries to take over GME because I think it will be very fortuitous to whoever realizes it's happening while it's happening. I also enjoy my GME porn to have a good story to it and I think I've crafted an enjoyable scene here

If I was Ryan Cohen, which tahnkfully for all of u I'm not because I'd burn this company to the ground faster than General Sherman, the last step to me trying to take over would be gobbling as many voting shares as I can. He's worth 600 mil, presumably not all liquid, but he also stopped right at 9.9% ownership because he's leaving the option open of going over 10% (or at least the impression of it). If he ticks over 10% he has 10 days to report and file. What I would do if I were him is I would plan my 10 days of purchases around earnings because that's when volume is the highest. Not only that, but that is when call option liquidity is the highest. There is 5 million worth of shares (50k call contracts) from current price to 20 strike expiring tm. There is 3 million worth of shares (30k contracts) expiring next week. He's not gonna be able to buy that many of the calls without giving away his move but again what I would do is buy as many of those as I could before I fire my final bullet to buy as much of GME as I can. Then, if I drive the price of GME over the strikes of calls that I own that works out because I'll just exercise and own even more GME. Again it's well over 10% of the float that is in calls expiring in the next 6 days up to the 20 stirke, idk how much of that he can buy without showing his hand but it's definitely going to be a helpful amount of voting power if he's really trying to pull off this take over.

Looked up what 10 days before tomorrow looked like, it was the Friday before the Monday that we gapped up 20% so there was definitely a lot of buying pressure there. GME is on, maybe. Lots of volume thru earnings as expected. Shorts definitely came through as we can see with the borrow rate spiking, price dropped 20% but I've seen intraday swings of 20% with what looked like less shorting pressure..is there buying pressure?

If I'm a speculator looking for a Ryan Cohen take over, I'm going to pay careful attention to the price action tomorrow morning. If I see a lot of early volume in the calls and then buying in the morning (buying has to start in the morning IMO coz that's when volume is highest and heavy buying can be a little more hidden) then the play is to yeet a bullet into way OTM calls expiring tm and then just fucking hold thru EOD if the trade is working in my favor.

GME Tribe: A Story About How Ryan Cohen is About to Kick Down Sherman's Door and Drink His Milkshake 🚀🚀🚀,0.97,"*Come gather ‘round GME management wherever you roam.* *And admit that the waters around you have grown and accept it that soon you’ll be drenched to the bone. If your time to you is worth saving, then you better start swimming or you’ll sink like a stone, for the times they are a-changin’.*

Story time for the GME crew. All those who are certain tHis iS bLoCkBusTer or the paper hands that sold yesterday can just keep scrolling. We wish you the best of luck in the best of all possible worlds: this one, dear Pangloss.

\*\*I’ve tried to submit this three times now and the moderators keep rejecting it. Maybe because I use too many naughty words? I guess I’ll try to clean that up a bit, which runs counter to all my instincts.

Did we have a good day Wednesday after that Q3 call? No, we did not. Do you know who lost over $20M (at least on paper) yesterday? Mr. Ryan Cohen. How do you think he felt about that CC and that inexplicable shelf registration that is, as one stocktwits commentator put it, a “poor man’s poison pill” and as obvious of a FU to Cohen and shareholders that the Board could have possibly designed? Do you think he was happy to see that?

I think he was thrilled to see it.

And now I’m going to tell you why. This is a long post, so I’m going to give the TL/DR sum up for you Paste Eating Rocket Kids, and this will serve as a warning that there are, in fact, a lot of words that you may choose to read or not. So if I still see one goddamn comment about this being a lot of words and where’s the rockets maaaaan, I might just transport myself through this internet connection and \[removed to satisfy the delicate sensibilities of the robot moderators\]. 

**So here’s the TL/DR**: I believe that Cohen is executing a plan to take out the GME Board. And I think that Sherman just walked right into Cohen’s trap because he’s a dumb, selfish Boomer with a huge ego and a Broken Brain. And Cohen is going to be a legend because of it after he executes this plan, triggers the MOASS, and takes control of GME to convert it to a tech-first gaming juggernaut.

Now, if you’re in on this GME shit, you likely know the outlines of the story here. But here’s a good link to refresh your memory about why we’re all here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4csaa/the\_real\_greatest\_short\_burn\_of\_the\_century\_part/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4csaa/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century_part/)

And for further background, my recent post about the battle here between George Sherman, out-of-touch Hired Gun B&M Boomer CEO with the Boomer-est of all possible Boomer names, and Ryan Cohen, Boy Genius, Actual Good Guy, and Man With The Chewy-fication Plan: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9apx5/gme\_q3\_call\_thoughts\_on\_the\_clash\_between\_cohen/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9apx5/gme_q3_call_thoughts_on_the_clash_between_cohen/)

So: are we ready to start READING and THINKING, children? Good.

Now what were you doing in the summer of 2020? I don’t give a shit what you were doing. But I do give a shit about what Ryan Cohen was doing. And there is a decent amount of evidence that Ryan Cohen spent the summer of 2020 hiring a bad ass lawyer and crafting a pretty solid plan to wrest control of a struggling Mall-based gaming retailer from its out of touch Boomer Board and CEO so he can turn it into an ecommerce juggernaut like his baby Chewy. And I think we are about to enter the next phase of that plan here shortly.

But before we get ahead of ourselves, let’s first all get acquainted with Christopher P. Davis, Esquire, the attorney listed on each of the 13Ds filed by RC Ventures.

**Chris Davis, Activist Attorney Extraordinaire and His Successful Use of the Consent Solicitation to Remove Dipshit Boards/CEOs**

To cut to the chase, Chris Davis (who is definitely NOT the same dude playing first base for the Orioles) is a badass NYC attorney recently recognized as one of the nation’s premier shareholder activist lawyers. [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kleinberg-kaplan-partner-chris-davis-recognized-by-chambers-usa-as-leading-shareholder-activist-lawyer-301090571.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kleinberg-kaplan-partner-chris-davis-recognized-by-chambers-usa-as-leading-shareholder-activist-lawyer-301090571.html).

So what was Chris Davis doing in the summer of 2020? So glad you asked. He was celebrating a major win he helped engineer on behalf of a “**first time activist** Michael Gorzynski” for a wholesale replacement of the sitting Board at HC2 Holdings, Inc (sounds fancy). He helped engineer this takeover via a “high stakes **consent solicitation** rather than the more typical proxy contest.”

Learn more about this here: [https://www.kkwc.com/insights/kleinberg-kaplan-advises-mg-capital-management-in-its-consent-solicitation-and-successful-settlement-with-hc2-holdings/](https://www.kkwc.com/insights/kleinberg-kaplan-advises-mg-capital-management-in-its-consent-solicitation-and-successful-settlement-with-hc2-holdings/)

Here’s a few more links if you care to learn more about that and how it all went down (spoiler alert: the activists settled for two seats on the Board and then the new Board very quickly ousted the dipshit Boomer CEO, Phil Falcone)

[http://www.shareholderforum.com/access/Library/20200219\_Deal.htm](http://www.shareholderforum.com/access/Library/20200219_Deal.htm)

In sum: if you look into Chris Davis, you can see that this guy is dialed the fuck in and knows how to get activist shareholders a win—even in very challenging circumstances.

**The Summer of ’20 Out-of-the-Blue Boy Genius Media Campaign and Cohen’s 13D Filing in August**

I’m going to return to the “**consent solicitation**” thing at the bottom and why I think it matters here, but I don’t want to lose momentum on the timeline and evidence. And the consent solicitation is Advanced Level Shit that I barely understand anyway. But I think it’s likely to be goddamn important so I’ll get to it.

Now, where were we? Oh yes, the inexplicable media campaign.

RC Ventures files its 13D on August 18th announcing that Ryan Cohen is now the proud owner of 5.8M shares or 9% (later increased to 9.8%) of That Cluttered Video Game Geekery You Used to Pass on Your Way to Jamba Juice or Wherever People Go in Malls. Uh, ok man. But then this is when the SP of this Future Blockbuster™ starts its real run as more catch on that Cohen has taken a huge stake and that is also part of the portfolio of Mr. Big Short himself and a bunch of institutions and they actually have cash and are definitely not going bankrupt and oh have you heard about the insane short percentage of float and the upcoming console cycle that invariably corresponds to a sharp spike in SP? Well have you? But to return to the point: RC was and is the largest shareholder.

But prior to the date Cohen filed his 13D, there is a renewed media campaign focused on Ryan Cohen, Ecommerce Billionaire Genius who built Chewy, kicked Amazon’s ass, and then sold it for $3.35B way back in the heady mask-free days of ‘17. Why the sudden re-emergence of Mr. Cohen in the summer of 2020 in such a prominent way with this glowing media campaign about a guy who sold a very successful pet supply business over three years ago? Fawning media exposure like that doesn’t just happen (or not usually). It’s engineered. Or, more charitably, helped along by people who know people and can introduce those people to Interesting Topics to Write About. And my guess is that Chris Davis, bad ass activist attorney based in New York City, Knows People and had a little something to do with it.

Here are the links to all of the glowing media pieces starting in the summer of 2020 (all absolutely worth a read to get to know who this guy is and what makes him tick):

And a lot of the speculation I’m wheeling and dealing here was introduced by our man Justin Dopierala at Seeking Alpha way back in a September article not too long after the 13D filings: [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4373819-gamestop-chewys-founder-ryan-cohen-finds-whats-next](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4373819-gamestop-chewys-founder-ryan-cohen-finds-whats-next)

But for now let’s “put a pin” on Mr. Dopierala, as George Sherman or some other Corporate Robot Dipshit might say, as he will be important to the story here again soon.

**The November 16th “F U Old Man” Letter**

If you haven’t read this ballsy letter Cohen wrote to the Board last month, you really should. We’ll wait for you. [https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC\_Ventures\_Letter\_to\_GameStop.pdf](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf)

OK, ready again?

I don’t want to question Cohen’s possible writing abilities or give away too many tricks of the lawyer trade here (AI should take care of that in about a decade), but that letter was 100% written by Chris Davis. I’d literally bet my entire portfolio on that fact alone. That’s why you hire gunners like him. The letter has that has deliciously direct and aggressive lawyerly tone—the kind you use when you want to send a very clear message to some asshole without spelling it all out. I fucking love this letter. It was one of the main reasons I put the rest of my chips into the GME basket. I doubt I’m alone there.

And what did we learn from this letter? Well: a lot. But I’m going to focus on a few quick things. First, we learned that over the Summer, Cohen had “private conversations” with the Board and Sherman about the need to pivot toward becoming a technology-driven business with a new strategic vision. And he calls out Sherman and the Board directly for lacking this vision, using Mainstreet-Friendly pejoratives like “c-suite” and “boardroom.” He takes a direct shot at Hired Gun Sherman’s Boomer-Ass Business Record (Advanced Auto Parts! Cool!) and his obvious bent towards what he knows: Boring Ass Low Margin B&M Bullshit Companies and straight-up calls him a dumb-ass old man (“twentieth-century focus!”) who Just Doesn’t Fucking Get It. He alleges that he and the Board have presided over “massive value destruction” (almost makes it sound intentional, or at least grossly negligent) and have never taken “full accountability” for all their fuck-ups and intransigence.

Some folks have suggested that, sure, Cohen wants change and yeah he seemed like he had a bit of a bee in his bonnet, but if he doesn’t get some good movement in those areas, he’ll just sell his 6.5M shares to tank the stock and take his ball and go home to play with his dog, who loves him No Matter What. In this interpretation, the letter is just Cohen Asking To Speak To The Manager and then if the response is not to his liking, well then, He Will Just Take His Business Elsewhere, thankyouverymuch.

I do not think that is what is going on here. Not with Ryan Cohen and Chris Davis. This letter is Ryan Cohen Crossing The Fucking Rubicon.

He did the honorable thing and took his vision to the Board and Sherman. How genuine he was in that effort, I have no idea, as my thesis is that he has had a takeover plan in place since he hired Chris Davis. But whatever the initial motivations, it was the honorable thing to do to discuss his vision with Sherman and the Board before he and Chris Davis eventually rip their fucking hearts out (which, spoiler: I believe he is getting ready to do as we speak).

Reasonable minds can disagree here, but I do not think you write a letter like that unless you have a plan to handle all possible responses to it. He just torched his collegial relationship, such as there ever was or could have been, with that CEO and that Board. He flaunts Chewy’s world-class infrastructure and market cap versus their lame ass sub-$1B Dying Mall Store Bullshit. And he makes a very public rejection of a seat on the board (and the reason given: because you fuckheads would just ignore me and drive me nuts while you continue doing Dumb Boomer Shit with my money all goddamn day), which made it 100% clear to me that this is Cohen Serving Goddamn Notice that unless they get serious about the scope of their turnaround and start listening to him and convey this new direction to shareholders asap, that he’s coming for them. He even alludes to his own turnaround plan but then tells them to do their jobs like the Big Capable Adults they are.

And then Cohen attaches this letter to an amended 13D to ensure that all shareholders see it and also see that he still holds all of his shares. Within hours, the WSJ had an article on this: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestops-new-billionaire-investor-calls-for-tech-centric-makeover-11605565458?mod=hp\_lista\_pos5](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestops-new-billionaire-investor-calls-for-tech-centric-makeover-11605565458?mod=hp_lista_pos5).

And guess what’s neat? If you are an interested shareholder or a habitual reader of the Wall Street Journal (I, sir, am not) and you saw that article, you might have wondered what this Cohen guy is all about? You know, Mortimer, the dog guy—made billions. And thanks to the recent out-of-the-blue marketing campaign that was definitely NOT engineered by Chris Davis as part of a takeover plan, your subsequent Google searches, and the recent articles they produced, likely made you think: this guy is a fucking whiz kid and I like the cut of his jib.

**Cohen Quietly Meets With Funds/Investors**

In the weeks leading up to earnings, sharp observers also notice something: Ryan Cohen is meeting with various large shareholders for some reason. There were several reports of this on stocktwits (links are lost to eternity in that cluttered hellhole unless some astute commentator can find and link in the comments), so some salt is a necessary accompaniment here (I like to cite my evidence), but we have at least **one confirmed meeting** with the head of DOMO Capital: Mr. Justin Dopierala. Now, Justin happens to be a pro-GME writer (and a sharp one at that) at Seeking Alpha. You know, that paywall website where people purporting to know what they’re talking about get paid peanuts to write purposefully inane articles for maximum clicks from other idiots? That one. Well Justin is one of the good ones there, and DOMO Capital is also a large shareholder of GME. (Conflict of interest, you say? Shut yo’ mouth!).

On November 30, at 9:19 AM (the payin’ for inanity crew can go see this – the comment is still there), Dopierala made the following comment on another SA article:

\*\*\*

“I've recently had the pleasure of having a 1 on 1 video meeting with Ryan Cohen that lasted over an hour.

Going forward, I no longer feel comfortable commenting on the topic (of Ryan Cohen), so please understand when I do not respond to any of your questions on this specific topic.

Ryan is a very intelligent man, and I remain as bullish as ever on GameStop's future.""

\*\*\*

So what can we extrapolate from this? Ryan Cohen likely reached out to DOMO Capital/Dopierala to discuss his strategic vision. I’m do not know if he announced his plans directly, or what the purpose of the call was (see the very below on how I think this all could relate to a consent solicitation to recall the board) but I’m sure, at the very least, the text, if not the subtext, was heavy as fuck on that Zoom call. And why do I think Cohen contacted him and not the other way around? Because Dopierala, a writer for SA that I’m sure would love to publish even an anodyne Q&A with Ryan Cohen to Get Him All the Clicks, didn’t get an on-the-record interview. Not even some softball about whether his dog prefers his Apple investment decision or his Wells Fargo one. No: he got the concession (assuming he did) to simply acknowledge that a discussion took place (buried in a comment on some other dude’s SA article), but he explicitly says he’s not going to talk about anything related to Cohen going forward. No sir, no how. But if Cohen is just a regular old fellow shareholder (Cue Ryan: “And Justin, please: the pleasure is all mine”), then why the fuck are you making a cagy comment and acting like you Have A Big Fucking Secret and Oh God I Wish I Could Tell You Something But I Just Cant! with that comment, Justin? The Man Doth Protesting and Shit, I say.

Here’s the article link for you Seeking Alpha Super Sleuths: [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4380313-gamestop-likely-already-digital-revenue-sharing-sony-up-to-10](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4380313-gamestop-likely-already-digital-revenue-sharing-sony-up-to-10)

And even yesterday, Dopierala can’t help himself. In a discussion about Cohen’s tweet yesterday (you saw the tweet right? What kind of GME-to-da-moon! investor are you anyway? [https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1336775515101949963](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1336775515101949963)), Dopierala gets all Jim Carey As The Riddler on us in a response to “EricinPDX,” (some dude living in the Portland Airport) who writes:

EricInPDX

I take his tweet as a total negative .. the Jim Cramer thing.

I have no position at the moment.

Our man Dopierala then responds “then you are wrong yet right.”

[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4393394-gamestop-cohen-right-to-downplay-ps5-xbox-series-mistakes-core-digital-problem](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4393394-gamestop-cohen-right-to-downplay-ps5-xbox-series-mistakes-core-digital-problem)

So I think he’s having a little fun talking like a slightly less backwardsy Yoda saying: yeah, that Cohen tweet was obviously negative because he’s highlighting how fucked GME seems after that Q3 call (and also, check out how Chewy’s doin’ in that clip!). But it’s also **not** negative because it means Cohen is about to rip Sherman’s still-beating heart out and Shock And Awe our asses with a vote. And I, Justin Dopierala, head of DOMO Capital, can be a little wink winky about this because, oh I don’t know, on our hour long call Cohen maybe used puppetry to act out “Bryan Flohen’s” plan to call a vote and supplant the Bad Man “Gerald Shorman” while asking “Would You Theoretically Be With Bryan Flohen?” with a few well-timed arch of the eyebrows. Or he got his explicit consent to his plan (see below re consent solicitations). We just do not know.

In conclusion: We know that Cohen met with shareholders in the period between the day he sent that letter and the date of the Q3 call. We just do not know what was said. But we do know that Dopierella, either out of a sense of journalistic ethics (Stop laughing you guys! Seriously!) or out of concern about possible SEC lookie-loos, decides to be up-front about his inability to even utter the name Ryan Cohen from now on.

**General George “Custard” Sherman’s Lame-Ass Empire Striking Back**

Let’s recall the letter now. I’m guessing a rich, egotistical pampered-ass hired gun Boomer CEO named George goddamn Sherman didn’t like someone who reminds him of his asshole kids talking to him like that.

We all know what happened next: the Q3 “Say Omnichannel One More Time Motherfucker!” call. As I mentioned in my prior post on this (link above if you care), Sherman pulled the boomer-ist of boomer moves in an act of self-sabotage that is likely to be studied in business courses once this whole story plays out. You see, that letter that Cohen/Davis sent was a trap. And Sherman and the Board and their Big Fucking Corporate Brains clearly lack an inner Admiral Ackbar.

Cohen sent that letter three weeks before the earnings call. And demanded that they conduct \*another\* strategic review and present a plan to shareholders outlining how they are going to fully pivot into a new technology focused company. Cohen knows they have no intention of doing this. He’s apparently been hectoring them all summer about it. And I’m guessing he talked to Sherman enough to know that the dude is just not on the level (as all of us who listened to that fumbling bland-ass corporate caveat-speak on that call got to experience as well). So he knows, like we all did, that Q3 earnings are likely to be middling at best. But unlike me, who clearly thought that the one way out of this for Sherman and the Board was to give some exciting guidance on Q4, maybe even a share buyback (as they are authorized to do) and some more info on the Microsoft deal, likely revenue, other possible similar deals with Nintendo and Sony. I don’t know, but Something. No, Cohen and Davis are way smarter than me and know Sherman a bit better and probably assumed that Sherman is likely to whiff on a response to his letter. And lo and behold, whiff he does. Nothing. We get no response to the letter and no real plan to transform GME into a tech-driven gaming company (Sherman: “but, but…I said Omnichannel you guys! What do you want from me beyond bland corporate robot speak!?”).

But what else happens? Sherman and the Board inexplicably authorize a shelf registration for up to $100M worth of ATM shares. This from a company that just bought back shares, is authorized to buy back more, paid down debt early—and now is about to be flush with Sweet, Sweet New Console Cash. What in the everlasting fuck?

And in case you were inclined to give Sherman and the Board the benefit of the doubt here (iT’s sO tHeY cAn pRoFiT oFf a ShOrtSquEEze!), the reason was simple and straightforward and included within the S3 filing itself. And that is: “Hey Cohen: Fuck Off. And if we have to dilute our shareholders to get you to fuck off, by God that’s the kind of shortsighted ME-first move that got George Sherman where he is today! So go find another company to hassle you ungrateful Millennial Start Up Dog Store Bro and let the adults handle this.”

Here is the provision in the S-3 (under the heading: Anti-Takeover Provisions) in case you fuckers ever even read this kind of thing:

*Authorized But Unissued Shares*

The authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock are available for future issuance without stockholder approval. These additional shares may be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital, corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The **existence of authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise**.

So instead of crushing the call and giving some dope guidance about Q4 and trigger the MOASS so we all revere the name George Sherman for All Eternity, Sherman and the Board make a lame-ass move to try to protect their jobs and--lo and behold!--THIS is the main takeaway of the report and call. And what drives the precipitous dive in SP AH and yesterday. A dive so steep that it removes well over $100M in market cap in value, the kinda-lame amount that you’re trying to stick Cohen with (and dilute all of us) so you can keep your Big Fancy-Man Job and the bonus you’re counting on so you and the misses can jet off to Sandals Jamaica like you always do. George: Whoops? Knew we should have gone with a higher number! A lame ass “poor man’s poison pill” as [u/snowk88](https://www.reddit.com/u/snowk88/) on stocktwits put it (shout out because he also helped me flush out this thesis a bit and clued me in on Chris Davis’s work for MC).

So back to how I started this missive, back when we were all younger and maybe a bit more naïve, right? Anyway. Yesterday Ryan Cohen lost over $20M on paper because George Sherman thought the best way to handle that Punk-Ass Millennial was to use shareholders as a hostage in any possible fight over control of this company he’s been building his entire—oh, eh, the last 18 months because he’s just a hired gun that goes where the money is and waits for his ka-ching moment before splitting because who gives a fuck he’s George Sherman and You’re Not. But guess what happens when you do that? (Hand down, George: you’ve had your turn). You ENRAGE the shareholders who you want to have your back and vote for you in any possible proxy fight or takeover offer! What strategery! You must have been involved in planning the Iraq war, George.

But guess who was likely laughing their ass off yesterday at their colossal good fortune at this misstep? Ryan Cohen and Chris Davis. Because now Sherman has opened the door even wider than it was before and made it that much easier for Cohen to get the votes and kick down his fucking door.

And yesterday, to no one’s surprise, the SP falls almost 20% and even Jim Fucking Cramer piles on and tells all his braindead Boomer TV watchers that this is The Next Blockbuster like all the other Super Sophisticated Analysts out there.

And now we see the #WeWantCohen and #InstallCohen hashtags (which you all should consider using frequently if you dig all this and think Sherman needs to go).

What are you thinking if you’re Ryan Cohen? Take your ball and go home time? Or: maybe that it’s time to Show George Sherman that You Do Not Fuck With a Super Nice Guy With Really Good Ideas That Are Usually Respectfully Presented (Unless You Piss Me Off) Like Ryan Goddamn Cohen?

I’m thinking it’s the latter. Taking all of this, I think Cohen and Chris Davis have been planning some kind of takeover, possibly even via consent solicitation like Davis did in his MC matter, since the summer and that George Sherman’s ironic attempt to save his own skin is about to backfire stupendously to help Cohen lock in the votes he needs. And it couldn’t happen to a nicer guy—excuse me—I mean: Smug Asshole.

**Epilogue: The Consent Solicitation**

Ed: the consent solicitation is not likely in play here.  But Cohen is definitely still coming for Sherman and Co - we just don't know exactly how yet.

Now, just what in the hell is a **consent solicitation** and why does it matter? I confess that I didn’t know shit about this until I started READING ALL THE WORDS, but our friends at theactivistinvestor.com have some useful information to help those of us with tiny little baby brains understand what it is and why it may be relevant here (relevant excerpts below, but it you really want to geek out on this shit, I would recommend clicking the link, reading the words and THINKING BIG THOUGHTS). And also, hoping that some folks can respond in comments to help flush this out further because it’s late and I’ve already written too many words.

But, before I drop some k-n-o knowledge from our friends at theactivistinvestor.com, just to remind you: GameStop is a Delaware Corporation.

Now imagine being magically whisked away to…Delaware! (Hi. I’m in Delaware).

CPT Hubbard here again. I’ll release you momentarily. But study those steps a bit and ponder where Cohen might be in that process. And also recall that we know that Cohen had an “off the record” meeting with our man Dopierala from DOMO Capital and we have no idea what they talked about. Could Cohen have been getting shareholders consent? No idea. But it certainly seems possible. If that is the case, the 60 day clock is ticking. Which means that, assuming Dopierala was stop #1 (probably doubtful, but it’s the one data point we have), we should know something by at least late January if Cohen is actually initiating a consent solicitation on this incompetent Board and probably a lot closer to mid-January (Sorry Jan call holders) since I assume Cohen started reaching out around the time he sent that letter on Nov 16th.

To which I say to Cohen: Little old me and my 20,000 shares consent! We consent most emphatically, sir. And no one will ever accuse you, Mr. Cohen, of not seeking consent. You may retain this for your records.

To conclude, Cohen is Young, Scrappy and Hungry and He’s Not Throwing Away His Shot. And Fuck George Sherman.

Potentially Solid Run Up to ER Play with FedEx - Shipping it on this play,0.64,"Let me be clear. I think nearly all of you guys in this sub now are absolute morons. And I don't mean the good kind of WSB Autist. I mean this whole sub is just sheep following the crowd. If that is you, don't read this. If you have only stocks in your Robinhood right now, don't read this. If you just bought GME or Palantir this week, don't read this. Most of you guys just stick to losing money in GME and other crap. 

For the few smart people still here, I think I have a play that may pay very well. FDX (FedEx) is looking like it is primed for a strong run up to ER next Thursday now. It has sold off hard the past two days after two recent price target raises, but has bounced back hard from identical sell offs this past month. It has crushed both of the last ER and has been on a solid trajectory upwards the past few months. It is currently rated a better buy than UPS by most. 

I will be playing this run up to ER. I bought in a little early, but I will likely be holding through next Thursday then selling before earnings. I think this should likely hit 305-310 before next Thursday based on previous price action and the highs it hit earlier this week. 

Do what you want with this. I am not a financial advisor.

Buying GME shares instead of calls is some YEYE market maker lie (80% borrow rate btw),0.88,"Please explain to me if I'm wrong but I really don't see how shares being in the hands of notoriously paper handed fools like WSB is going to trigger any short squeeze. Ur calls need to be delta hedged anyways. Borrow rate on IBKR right now is 80%. Are any of you getting 80% for ur shares? Well someone fucking is. 

I think IBKR splits borrow fees with you if you opt in but for the rest of us smucks there is

1. no way to keep people from borrowing ur shares. even setting a high limit order or whatever ur brokerages are happy to let ur shares be borrowed out
2. the only people benefitting are our fuck ass brokers that get to lend out our shares and RN they're making 80% while our shit chops back and forth and back and forth

I still have shares coz I'm basically all in on this play and having some amount of shares is the only thing that's going to keep me solvent if this play goes south, also I want to take advantage of any afterhours absurd action if some news breaks after hours or whatever but I'm really not trying to ""hold"" shares just so my fuck ass broker can be making 80% off of me

Shame to see so many losses in PLTR, GME, or whatever other flavor-of-the-month meme stock WSB. Consider instead a leveraged portfolio of cheap, global stocks so you actually see some green for a change.

3. No mention of Cohen or Microsoft Deal.

Just want to let people know that that 100m dollars (**NOT SHARES**) in dilution is just an option.

*OK. And then, in terms of the new shelf, you know, I saw that you mentioned general corporate purposes. Would you consider issuing stocks to repay debt under that program?*

*George Sherman -- Chief Executive Officer*

*No, that's absolutely not the intent. The intent here is to simply optimize flexibility and optionality. Period. There is a lot of unknowns going on in the marketplace with respect to this pandemic, ongoing flex of cases across the world, the impacts on our own businesses.*

*And we're not immune to that, right? And, in that regard, look, we're going to continue to execute our strategies that have bolstered and strengthen our balance sheet. And you see all the work that we've done, including, if we go back to even the long-term debt levels in early 2019 until today, it's -- you know, as of this coming Friday will have reduced our long-term debt over $530 million, by March of '21, they'll be over $600 million. In that same timeframe, that same roughly 24-month timeframe, plus or minus, we also returned over $200 million to shareholders. So, I think -- look, the goal is to continue to focus on running the business and optimizing we run the business, but also be very pragmatic and make sure that we have capital flexibility with no intention to do anything other than maintain our flexibility.*

*Hopefully that helps you.*

*And as far as \[Inaudible\] is concerned, we don't need it. We don't need it. Bottom line.*

What now?

Since this earnings the only thing that has changed is that management is confirmed to be survival mode to save their jobs because Cohen wants to kick them out. [Check Jeff’s DD on GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4csaa/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century_part/) and ask yourself how much of that has changed? Nothing.

Everyone knew that earnings was going to be shit since this quarter marks the END of the console cycle.

For all the doomsayers and fucken 1 ply toilet paper hands, you probably sold and took the loss after you got your ass handed to you by yours truly Melvin Capital. [Here you can see how the # of shares available dropped from 45k to 1k and fees basically skyrocketed.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) Short the shit out of the stock and hit all those stop losses and paint a terrible earnings picture for GME.

This isn’t the first time, last earnings they did the same shit (September 9,2020) stock went from 7.35$ to 6.23$ only to rocket up to 9$ in a week. They do this shit every earnings.

GameStop is like PLTR, manipulated to hell by hedge funds except for GameStop they ran out of ammo (SI over 100% and they are underwater) and they’re firing blanks at you.

Behavioral Finance: You’re Retarded Explained,0.95,"As I am watching my portfolio sink into the literal pits of hell, I figured I will make a post that might help some of the ~~investors~~ retards on this sub better understand why they do what they do so that they can recognize and then overcome some of the blind spots in their decision making.   

I will start off with a brief intro into BF, then I will list off some emotional and cognitive biases that retail investors are notorious for exhibiting. Hopefully, by the end of this post, you will become more self-aware of what you are doing and become that much closer to someone that doesn’t lose his rent money on a regular basis. 

**What is Behavioral Finance (BF)**

To put it in simplest terms, BF attempts to understand and explain observed investor and market behaviors. 

You are all familiar with traditional, neo-classical finance where it assumes investors are risk-averse (lol), maximize utility (level of satisfaction received from the consumption of goods and services), and the markets are efficient in every single way. BF essentially says that’s all bullshit because in reality, people are seldom rational and cannot possibly consider all available information when making a decision, therefore, the markets are not efficient at all. 

To put it in layman’s terms, just like two wrongs don’t make a right, BF states that stuffing a million retards on Robinhood doesn’t make an Einstein. 

**Emotional Bias**

1. Loss Aversion Bias: People tend to strongly prefer avoiding losses as opposed to gains. This will cause people to hold on to failing securities. This is a big one on this sub. Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for strong hands and all but recognize when you’re in a bad play and don’t be afraid to get out. 

2. Overconfidence Bias: Unwarranted faith in their own intuitive reasoning, judgement, and cognitive ability. This is a big one and is shown every time someone yolo their life savings on far OTM options. 

3. Self-Control Bias: Failure to act in pursuit of their long-term goals due to a lack of self-discipline. This is anyone in GME gang that paper handed and sold at open without realizing that the long term play is to bank on this company turning around starting in 20Q4 and triggering a short squeeze. 

4. Status Quo Bias: Doing nothing instead of making a change. Example are those that never closed their TSLA puts. 

5. Regret-Aversion Bias: Avoid making decisions that will result in action out of fear that decision will turn out poorly. Stop being a pussy. 

**Cognitive Errors**

1. Cognitive Dissonance: mental discomfort that occurs when new information conflicts with previously held beliefs. This is shown when people only notice information that confirm existing biases and ignore conflicting points of view. 

2. Conservation Bias: People maintain prior views by inadequately incorporating new information. Will often result in being too slow to update their viewpoints and end up bag holding major losses. A good example are those that diamond handed SPY puts in March. 

3. Confirmation Bias: people only look for and notice what confirms their own beliefs and ignore those that contradict. An example can be virtually any “gang” that existed in WSB history. Tanker gang, silver gang, etc. 

4. Representativeness Bias: people classify new information based on past experience and not realize that just because something happened in the past does not mean it is repeating itself right now. An example can be anytime someone compares the March crash to 08 or 1929. 

5. Anchoring Bias: Use of a psychological heuristic that influences the way people estimate probabilities. This is every time someone says stocks are at an ATH, why should I buy? Without looking at the fundamentals that drove the stock there to begin with

6. Mental Accounting Bias: Treating one sum of money differently to another equal sum. Money is money, get over it. 

7. Framing Bias: answering a question differently based on way it is asked. 

8. Availability Bias: people take a heuristic approach to estimating the probability of an outcome based on how easily outcome comes to mind. Everytime stocks dip 5-7% I guarantee you there will be posts saying the crash is here simply because people can easily remember March. 

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, before making a decision, ask yourself if any of these biases apply to you. If so, you are probably not thinking straight and acting like a total retard. All of these biases can be countered by having a clear head, understand your risk tolerance and return objectives, and having a clear long term strategy.",2020-12-09 20:28:56

AirBNB & DoorDash IPOs | CHEWY & GameStop EARNINGS | APPLE news| STOCK MARKET NEWS [12-09],0.95,"**Chewy crushes earnings reports, while GameStop disappoints. What is the latest news on Apple and the new AirPods Max? Should we buy AirBNB or DoorDash when they launch tomorrow? Let’s talk about this and more about the stock market**

Hey everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/8zQQ165) leading the way up half a percent, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/9pFmQ0X) up .28%, both of them closing at new record highs with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/bbsbdqM) also up .35% to close Tuesday. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/5MPVyNn) also showed a steady decline through the day as it dropped almost 3%. This moves in the market were caused by the [latest](https://ibb.co/Lnr5Q3X) hopes for a stimulus deal to be agreed on by the end of current session in congress as there seems to be a lot of ground on which parties can agree on. Things have gotten worse in the economy since this hole stimulus talk has been going around, so, if both parties would have been more willing to give up some ground, people would have already gotten more support and we would probably be talking about other bills or measures that would have helped even more. So, maybe this [latest](https://ibb.co/w4LYBk9) Mnuchin proposal with maybe minor tweaks would be the best chance of anything happening by the end of this year.

We saw more companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/R9N61kK) as over 3 thousand companies were moving up, continuing the huge bull run started in November as more than 84% of companies are moving above the 50 and 200-day moving averages. The best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/hLpbcrx) yesterday were Energy and Health Care while Real Estate and Utilities lagged behind as Large-Cap Growth companies were the only company factor [analysis](https://ibb.co/zbJd6m2) that lost ground yesterday, with small-caps, especially small-cap growth companies largely outperforming the markets.

You can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/hcMmt7x) that there were gains to be made yesterday in a lot of parts of the stock market, with only a few big red spots on the map.

[Today](https://ibb.co/RgSDj55) we will get some numbers on the November Job [openings](https://ibb.co/VLVz771), MBA mortgage applications and Petroleum inventories. 

While we got some earnings yesterday from Chewy which dazzled again in [earnings](https://ibb.co/Jd7Scx1) with the only small miss coming in net sales per customer, but as the number of customers keeps increasing, this might continue to go down, as not every pet owner spends the same amount of big money on pets. The company [reported](https://ibb.co/WVndSgJ) an EBITDA of $5.5M vs a loss of over $9M expected with the gross margin increasing to over 25% while also giving great [guidance](https://ibb.co/h8BPK2W) for Q4 of $1.94B to $1.96B vs less than $1.8B expected by analysts.

The company also turned around to a positive [cash flow](https://ibb.co/ys3NVTc) of over $30M. I really like this company and I expected it to be a good own at least for the next quarter until they reach more hard earnings comps next year.

Meanwhile, as I expected GameStop had another bad [quarter](https://ibb.co/DWP4jZh) despite beating some earnings estimates with a smaller loss than expected, the revenue still continued to drop over 30% on a year over year basis while comps where even worse missing the expectations by quite a margin. 

Though e-commerce sales rose by more than 250% in Q3, this did not offset the comparable store sales. Margins also declined with hardware margins being the biggest reasons why. I think this company has a very though challenge on its hands with e-commerce being such a though place to compete in, I think the shift to online has been delayed for this company and I think it will struggle to survive, even though it might see a boost next quarter from the sales of the new gaming consoles that were released last month from both Sony and Microsoft.  [GME EARNINGS HIGHLIGHTS](https://ibb.co/SymxCtK)

I wouldn’t touch this [stock](https://ibb.co/K0cN5ds) as I think there are far better plays out there than betting on this struggling company.

The only company that I am interested today which will release earnings results is [ADOBE](https://ibb.co/d5SBbyX) which is expected to have the best results ever for the company with an increase of over 12% in both EPS and Revenues. Last go around despite posting great results, the stock fell more than 4% in September and have just recovered to that price point. I expect it this time to go higher and stay that way if they manage to deliver the best quarter on the books.

Meanwhile [DoorDash](https://ibb.co/FgJ5k7z) is pricing its initial public offering at over 100$/share which I believe is ridiculous, and it is an flat out joke of a valuation, this company has benefited a ton from this economy and still, this valuation implies that they will have over 50% of the total addressable market not in the US, but in the WORLD in the next couple of years, I don’t think this is a good investment opportunity, they will have increasing competition that offer the same thing for free or cheaper, this is a very though business to try and take over as one single company. People will also be way more likely to start going to restaurants maybe not in 2021 but for sure starting 2022 or whenever the vaccines are widely available in the entire world. I wouldn’t touch this stock at such high valuations, especially over 110$, even if I was looking for short-term gains which might end up being the case, I think there are better opportunities out there.

In contrast to DoorDash, I might be interested to buy some AirBNB if the price is right after the [IPO](https://ibb.co/RBDhWW0), I think it will have a much better future, as personally I really like to rent out apartments or homes whenever I go on a vacation rather than a traditional hotel. And even though it might have a tough Q4 and Q1 next year, I expect by Q2 next year more people will be vaccinated, so more people will start and go out and travel, and with especially low comps for next year as bookings are way down in 2020 this might make the company look much more attractive by this time next year. So, between DoorDash and AirBNB, I clearly like AirBNB a whole damn lot more.

In other IPO news, [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/WyJs5vQ) is expected to go public as soon as Q1 next year as they seek a valuation of over $20B.

Some other [Boeing](https://ibb.co/6rN04h6) came for companies like Boeing which made its first 737 MAX delivery since the ban ended, as it is expected to start rolling out deliveries and upgrades for current planes at a very good rate with more good news coming from the UK which will suspend the tariffs imposed on US Goods.

While [PENN](https://ibb.co/qJhKxGY) gaming ran to an all-time high yesterday after news that sports betting may be launched in Michigan as early as six weeks from now, as legalization of gambling is moving faster and faster in the US, this also bolds well for DraftKings and other gambling stocks.

Also, [ETSY](https://ibb.co/F0vsdmD) keeps getting upgrades from analysts as they are expected to have a great Q4 suggested from the most recent November sales data.

And finally let’s talk about Apple, as they just [revealed](https://ibb.co/dKrwT6j) the new AirPods Max headphone yesterday, with a huge price tag of 549$, this seemed to gain a pretty bad reaction from [consumers](https://ibb.co/CJ8DkLR) as [they](https://ibb.co/xz2HDXx) complained about the huge price tag with competitors like Bose and others selling similar headphones for 350$ or less. These headphones, also have a bigger price tag than even the new PS5 videogame console so we will have to wait and see if this is a successful product from Apple, I think they have gone a little overboard with the price, but rich people do tend to pay a premium for brand names. This can also be seen in the [latest](https://ibb.co/By3F6jS) analyst call from JPMorgan as customers appear to favor high end models as delivery times have been increasing for the 12 Pro and 12 PRO MAX. 

On the better side of things for Apple, the [Fitness+](https://ibb.co/Kh3KnQg) service is expected to launch on the 14th of December and it will cost $9.99/month or $79.99$/year. I expect this to be a better success for the company and to drive an even more stable increase of revenues, as subscription-based revenues are better than one-time sales. 

So, I still like this company the most in the long-term and it might see a spike in the near future, especially moving closer to Q4 results and earnings. Apple is still the biggest position in my portfolio and I am not planning on changing that anytime soon.

Good luck to everyone in the stock market as the [futures](https://ibb.co/q7rHvL5) are mixed while writing this post with the DOW and SP500 gaining ground while the Nasdaq futures are just down for the moment.

WSB: Lets demand a GME share holder meeting,0.95,"Hey  guys, any of you that listened to the earnings/guidance from Game Stop know  how retarded management is.... We are all banking on an evolution or  chewie-fication of Game Stop rather than boomers doubling down on a dying  business and praying a new console cycle will save them. In light of the  new revelation that they are ""Creating"" 100m shares out of thin are to  either fight off cohens hostile take over, or to fuck us when the  squeeze takes off so they can profit off of us i was trying to figure  out how we as share holders can fuck over sherman and the fucks with him  and i found this gem...

""This section of the original post has been redacted due to the retarded nature of its content... In the United States shareholders cannot force shareholder meetings, but there are other options available... Those options are currently being explored... ""

For  those of you too retarded to see where this is going - all of us  holding shares should write a letter and demand a share holder  meeting.... WSB holds around 5% and im sure Cohen and Burry would help  out and boom... we get to force Game Stop/Sherman to address Cohens letter and  we get to ask the questions.. be the big man with the microphone... we  get to swing our dicks while looking at swim suit magazines.. we... oh  right i forgot to take my adult hyperactivity dis... oh look a butterfly... any how... I think  it would be a  great headline ""WSB calls share holder meeting""....  What do you guys  thinks?

**Edit:** For those of you throwing shade - im still green... I bought in at around $10... so unless the dip is that hard - Im still winning.....

I just want a god damn short squeeze... and I think it will be a cool headline ""WSB demands share holder meeting""... additionally, it will be just as much fun to ask retarded questions to the board such as - ""in your opinion do Stonks only go up, and if true, why did your stonk go down?"" among other fun things to fuck with the boomers before making them address what we really want - Cohen leading the ecomm charge.  


**Edit 2:** some of you tards haven't been paying attention... so here is a link to another post - its how i got the 5% [**https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6jjm3/wsb\_owns\_58\_of\_gme\_gme\_survey\_update/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6jjm3/wsb_owns_58_of_gme_gme_survey_update/)

Edit 3: Im still at work, so i cant work on templets or anything so enjoy this meme i made in the mean time.  https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x7xxdyd

Edit 4: because im kind of retarded and im not smart enough to figure out what i need to know, ill call a few attorneys today and see if we as a collective can do anything... if need be ill toss 100-200 bucks at consult fees - its worth knowing :P... I'll update you guys as I get the info.


Final Edit / 5 : I have been speaking with an attorney the next few steps will be a bit long so when the next step is ready I will post a new post, and reference this one / ill add the next post link to this edit.

GME - a bit for everyone,0.89,"I see two types of people after today, and I don’t like any of them. 
 
1. “Boo-fuckin-hoo, I lost $Xk on GME, should I sell?”
2. “HAHAHAHA I’m fucking loving this, GME retards got what they deserved, fuck yeah, bruuuh!!!”

Lemme deal with #1 first, because these are still decent humans. 3 words, tard. Sell. Motherfucking. CC’s. How much are you down per share? $2? $3? More? Doesn’t matter. You have 100 shares, you have a fighting chance. Time to join theta gang. Sure, sometimes they give us shit, but their strategies work. So, Sell-To-Open a covered call for each 100 share bag you’re holding, find a strike price above or at your cost basis, chose and expiry and boom - some amount of dollars goes back into your account. Good, now your cost basis is $X minus the value of the call. If GME recovers and shoots past $X, your shares get called away, but you made profit. If it doesn’t, if it trades sideways or goes down, theta/delta drive the price of the call down, ao buy that shit back for a net profit and repeat. Remember, if you have a multiple of 100 shares, you can still fight. First rule - don’t lose money. 

Now, #2. You fuckers make me sick. I mean, sure, we don’t feel sorry for you when you lose money, you dance with the market, you accepts the risks, but there’s literally no good reason to be happy about it, let alone ecstatic. Is your wife less ugly and your dick longer because some sad shmuck loses his rent money on GME? Is their misfortune somehow making your life less of a shithole? Are you no longer living in your parent’s basement because an autist bought GME calls when fucking everyone said “buy shares”? Be a decent fucking human being and don’t gloat. Oh, and another thing. That company still sold one billion motherfucking dollars of stuff in a quarter, despite the shithow we live in. What did you do this quarter? Some of you are gonna point me to your massive gains, but I say to fuck with that - you did it with massive help of lady luck, some other company’s hard work and your hand in your pants, GME made their $$ from hard work, that makes them respectable, and you a lucky speculator that’s gonna lose their shirt one day while GME still survives.

# TL;DR;
1 - stop whining, put your big boy pants on and either DCA or sell CCs.
2 - eat a dick.

Downvote this to oblivion or upvote it to stratosphere, I don’t care. 

Positions: 300 shares at $14.78, sold 3 $21 12/11 calls, sold 7 $13 12/11 puts. Don’t give a shit if assigned, I’ll continue to hold 1000 shares and sell CCs.",2020-12-09 05:36:06

[DD] GME shareholder DD and support thread,0.89,"This is for shareholders only, if you bought calls expiring before late Jan you probably can't read since almost every DD before this told you to buy shares or LEAPs.

So anyway after GME management has shown themselves to be as retarded as we are, I thought I'd share a few things for the newbies to help cope and recoup losses after today's shit show. if you read my previous post you would've expected a dump after Q3 earnings, although I have to admit I was expecting a 10% dump, not a 17% dump. That shelf offering was completely unexpected and the only valid reason for having it IMO would be for management to sell some shares during a squeeze to help raise funds. There are a few other reasons that people brought up that I thought made sense, no need for me to repeat it here. 

Fundamentally the earnings were pretty much as expected, a better than expected loss was pretty much priced in and things look like they're on track for Q4. Management closed more unprofitable stores, reduced inventory, sold their private jet (lol), and e-commerce is up. Risks to that outlook would be a restart of lockdowns and stimulus not being passed on time. Remember that IWM and many other ETFs hold quite a lot of GME shares, so a dump in those means we dumping as well. Don't forget to think about the risk of an overall market dump, since we are getting close to dec OPEX with record low put/call ratios, this market is being driven up by call buying and MM hedging can dump just as hard as they pump. I'm just gonna go ahead and guess that'll take place between late dec- early Feb, watch for changes in option positioning and VIX term structure for clues.

Between now and Q4, the only catalyst for a durable pump would be the announcement of deals like the one with MSFT (there are rumors of a deal with SONY, not likely IMO), reports of VERY strong sales of consoles (good isn't good enough). We will likely start to have a slow ramp-up leading up to the earnings. These are your reasons to bag hold. 

People keep on asking RC to start a takeover but I doubt that will happen, in fact, I think RC might just sell his stake, since it's already up like 300%. Don't make any significant moves based on speculations on what RC might do.

For the immediate near term, figure out how to sell covered calls if you haven't already, selling weeklies can help bring down your cost basis, especially while IV is high. iBorrow shows borrow costs at 50%, which is near ATH I think, we might get a small but significant short-covering rally, sell your calls into these rallies. On the other hand, WSB might FOMO into weekly puts, which will also inevitably backfire but drag prices down in the process, take advantage of this by finding put walls near support and selling puts at a price you're comfortable DCA-ing at. 

Keep your eyes on the prize, which IMO really just come down to a new console cycle, the fact that there is a shortage of consoles right now just means people will be forced to shop at GME when other giants like AMZN or WMT runs out of stock. Keep an eye on any news about logistics and supply chain, if the giants get the upper hand in procuring new consoles, that will seriously damage the bull thesis

It should be illegal for a company to be both authorized to buy back shares and have an ATM shelf offering outstanding (GME),0.87,"But I don't make the rules and it should be obvious that GME is getting ready to profit off of a short squeeze should one happen by either Cohen forcing a vote OR by GME yeeting their 100 mil authorization in before Buyden gets inaugurated and the Dems (possibly) try to make share buybacks illegal or something

Long GME

Also someone please explain to me how diluting makes it harder for Cohen to take over coz I just saw GME say they were diluting by 10% but they knocked 17% off of their market cap. Doesn't that make it easier for Cohen to take whatever controlling stake since now the market cap is cheaper and isn't a controlling stake like 50% of the company or something I don't get it. I really think this at the shelf offering is preparation to take advantage of a short squeeze

On the one hand it caps how high the short squeeze is gonna go

On the other hand it incentivizes GME's management to get the party started since GME's balance sheet is about to get even better if they trigger one soon with an onslaught of good news.",2020-12-09 03:54:34

GME Earnings Call,0.92,"Having actually listened to the entirety of the earnings call, it seems that, despite the downwards pressure, GME might actually be preparing itself rather well for the short squeeze. That said, I hope you autists were in fact in with shares, and not calls: otherwise, u r fuk. 

But back to the point: there was one very interesting pair of questions posed during the call: the first related to why GME would be planning to sell more shares ($100million’s worth). The answer was given with remarkable force compared to most of the others, and was also quite clearer: it was emphasized that GME did NOT NEED THE MONEY: it was simply an option being considered for the sole possible purpose of “increasing liquidity.” The reason they gave was in case the beer flu hit them hard again. With the vaccine coming, this seems like horse shit. To translate their likely intention for gay bears: if in fact there is a short squeeze, they would be primed to capitalize off of it by selling off some shares at a crazy good price. In addition, when asked if they would be buying back more shares in general, they said “it would not be off the table”: and I’m pretty certain that other $100 million left for share buybacks by the end of this fiscal year hasn’t been used yet. I think they’ve definitely got their heads out of the sand, and I look forward to their continued success.
Continued success, you ask? Yes. Their fourth quarter, if what they said is true, might be the first profitable quarter they’ve had in years. Good luck, everyone.

Gamestop Shelf Offering,0.97,"Gamestop files for a mixed shelf offering, looks like $100m. I was thinking about getting into $GME post earnings for the run/up short squeeze everyone has been talking about for quite a while now. I don't have a position yet, but I think even with this announcement I'll scale into a position regardless with some options. Even at $100m offering, that is a dilution of less than 10 million shares. I believe the numbers were something like 60+ million shares held short in the middle of November. I'm sure that the number has decreased but I doubt that the short float has dropped to below 10 million shares. I'm pretty sure shorts are looking for a way out of this squeeze, and maybe this is their saving grace, I'll start grabbing a position later this week with some long term options.

Am I missing something from my 10 second DD? I'm bullish, going to start grabbing long term call options above $20 strike

GME Q3 Call Thoughts on the clash between Cohen and Sherman [Insert Rocket Emoji Here],0.97,"I posted this on stocktwits and in another comment thread, but given the feedback I've received, I thought I would create a new post to let this august community think Deep Thoughts about all of this as we approach the moment of truth.  I'm not a social media guy so I usually don't get how all this shit works - just a 40-year-old lawyer who hates his job and sees a ticket out.  Do your own DD and figure your own shit out.  But the time is drawing nigh here for GME.

To start, I have 20,000 shares and 570 April 20/25Cs across three separate accounts. I also picked up about 100 calls for Jan/late Dec this week just for the hell of it (fuck IV crush when you’re boarding a rocket). I'm holding them all through ER. This could prove to be folly or it could make me very rich. I’ll know pretty soon.

I know there has been some discussion of this here and there, but I find the psychological profiles of the folks in this situation to be very interesting--particularly because both Sherman (current CEO) and Cohen know that, fundamentals aside, this thing is sitting on a powder keg with the short %. But first take Cohen. Boy genius who builds Chewy with his smarts and an ethos dedicated to care for the customer. Beats Amazon in this niche area because he outworked and outsmarted everyone. Worked super close with his Dad, who sounds like an amazing businessman with an old school ethic about treating customers/employees well. After building this juggernaut he sold it for 3Bil. Dude did all of this before he was 33. Then says screw diversification and YOLOs into Apple and Wells Fargo. Apple goes berzerk and splits and he makes more millions. All the while watching and waiting for something new to come around.

And then almost exactly a year ago, Cohen’s Dad dies. There are many interviews when he talks about this: his Dad was only 69 and he is barely 35 and that’s early as shit to lose your father and best friend. Do not underestimate what that can do to someone and what lessons one might take from that or how that person feels now barely a year away from that happening. Cohen clearly reveres his Dad for his hard working ethic and how he taught him tenacity when you know you’re right. So Cohen finds GME and he sees that this brilliantly set-up company in an explosive growth sector has been run into the ground by prior management. He thinks he knows the way out: the “Chewy-fication” of GameStop – efficient, customer-focused ecommerce sector domination. So he takes a big stake and then talks to Sherman and explains what needs to happen to save this company.

And if the letter he sent last month reflects reality and is not posturing, Cohen is rebuffed a bit. Maybe Boomer Sherman doesn’t like the cut of his jib and patronizes him. Maybe Cohen didn’t like Sherman’s focus on short term profit at the expense of building long-term customer loyalty (the one of two trucks his Dad talks about, which Cohen cites frequently in his interviews). Who knows. But whatever it was, being rebuffed seems to piss Cohen off--judging by the tone of that letter. Oh, and he’s made it known that he has hired basically the top activist investor/takeover law firm and attorney in the country. So he puts Sherman in the hot seat: outline your plan to make GameStop what I know it can be as soon as possible. He knows Q3 earnings is in three weeks when he sends that letter. He’s saying: Don’t you let another conference call go by without outlining this plan. Or else.

And the “or else” is of course all speculative. But I do not think that the “or else” is Cohen selling his shares and sulking home pissed off that these mean Boomers didn’t do things the way he wanted them to do. No, I think this guy drinks Sherman’s fucking milkshake, takes this thing and shows the world how it’s done. He’s got the eye of the tiger, he’s still in that young and crushing it phase. He’s got his Dad, his Obi-Wan, guiding him on this. So he’s going to do this right. This is his moment and I think he sees that. He’s watching his baby Chewy with a MC of $30B. He knows he can do that or better with GME. And he is not going to take no for an answer.

Then take Sherman. Dude has been Mr. Big Shot Hired-Gun CEO for a while now. Brought in to right this ship and Be The Man. And just as he starts to turn around this company—the moment he has been waiting for these difficult past 1.5 years (THE NEW CONSOLES ARE HERE!) this Chewy billionaire startup bro who is probably the same age as his children comes in and starts trying to tell \*him\* how to run a major public corporation. The nerve of this kid. Then, to make things worse, as Sherman prepares for the console release season and the Q3 earnings call, Cohen writes a scathing public letter attached to his 13D that calls out GameStop for being run by idiots and calls out Sherman specifically for being an out-of-touch boomer who doesn’t know the value of what he even has or what to do with it.

And this kid demands another strategic review and a public response on the obvious direction that Sherman needs to take the company. Sherman is not dumb. He knows who Cohen’s attorney is and he knows what Cohen is implying in that letter and the money Cohen has. Sherman now knows that the time he has to show shareholders he can turn this thing around has now shrunk. It’s go time. New consoles are out, Q4 numbers are likely to be through the roof and you have to address shareholders for the Q3 earnings call – one that everyone knows is likely to be a dud since it was pre-console cycle. So it’s a gimmie on numbers anyway. What self-respecting Master of the Universe hired gun Boomer CEO would just wilt under this pressure and fail to give every possible piece of good news to try to show shareholders his worth? The wolf is at the door and wants you in the unemployment line because you’re out of touch. Do you go quietly into the night?

Or do you give this punk-ass Millennial Start Up Bro a lesson that You Don’t Mess With the Shermanator? It would be an extraordinary act of self-sabotage if Sherman gave some cagy milquetoast guidance along with some middling Q3 numbers. It’s almost unthinkable. If GameStop has something good to talk about tomorrow, I’m guessing we hear all about it loud and clear. All Sherman’s incentives – financial, ego – point to him trying to knock it out of the park with Q4 guidance. If Sherman doesn’t take this golden opportunity to show his worth and start this squeeze, he deserves everything that’s coming to him. But even though I’d jump at the chance to see Cohen at the helm long term, I’m guessing he gives it his all since the possible outcomes aren’t hard see here. We will know soon if Sherman is a dead man walking or the temporary Hero and Savior of Gamestock, first of his name. And all the while, Mr. Moneybags Ecommerce Boy Genius watches and waits.

This is going to be fun to watch, to say the least.

EDIT:  After that call and the shelf, Sherman clearly deserves none of the credit I gave him here.  The company is solid and will be fine and everyone with shares and April calls should be AOK.  Lots of positive stuff.  But Sherman miscalculated horribly with the shelf.  Cohen is going to rip Sherman's fucking heart out and make him watch, Temple of Doom Style.  This is when things start to get interesting.

EDIT 2:  In light of recent events, I would like to amend my last two paragraphs.  I will leave the first three sentences and then conclude with the amount of credit I should have given this greedy shortsighted, dumbfuck Boomer.

""And this kid demands another strategic review and a public response on the obvious direction that Sherman needs to take the company. Sherman is not dumb. He knows who Cohen’s attorney is and he knows what Cohen is implying in that letter and the money Cohen has.  So Sherman decides that instead of carefully considering Cohen's critiques and then bolstering his case to lead this company by buying back shares (as authorized) or giving better guidance on Q4 to possibly raise the share price and even trigger a short squeeze, delighting shareholders far and wide and even making them feel a sense of loyalty to him for it, Sherman goes for the all-too-perfect encapsulation of a Baby Boomer move: he protects himself with a totally needless shelf registration that is a transparent, weak-ass poison pill.  But one that threatens to destroy shareholder value and let the shorts off the hook should an activist investor try to get a little too cute with their operations.  Using us, the shareholders, as pawns in any possible proxy fight.  Because Fuck You, I'm George Fucking Sherman.  You'll get your Q4 numbers and I'll get my bonus and you can fuck right off.

We should all be outraged at how this was handled.  And I can guarantee you that if Cohen was contemplating a takeover or a total removal of the Board, this couldn't have gone any better for him.  The fear was likely that Sherman crushes it and we all shout the name Sherman! Sherman! from the rafters (not you Georgians probably) in exultation at our good fortune.  A shelf registration and an after hours drop in price of 17%??  Chris Davis, Cohen's attorney, must be shitting himself at his good fortune.  If Cohen moves, he is going to move quickly on this - possibly even tomorrow if the price really gets hammered.  Wishful thinking?  Yeah, possibly.  But if I had the ability to call a vote on replacement of the Board and knew that could likely trigger a massive short squeeze for a stock I own nearly 10% of?  I'd consider doing that.  Very much so.  And if I wanted to replace an inept Board and CEO, would I want him to do something that is transparently selfish and possibly destroys shareholder value?  Yeah, I fucking would.  And I would have a much easier time doing it right after almost every shareholder heard that call and thought: Fuck this Sherman guy. Which is the real thing ringing through the rafters tonight.

Earnings pre GME thread,0.94,"if ur like me ur networth is gonna change for worse (or maybe even better) in like 6 hours and probably oscillate wildly through the week. How are you playing earnings? The OI on this option chain is literally fucking insane btw. Within 2 dollars of current price there are 15k put options expiring this week and 9k call options, which notionally control 2.4 million shares so like 3 or 4% of float or whatever

Next week has an even more absurd amount of put options OI - fucking 30k of put options within 2 dollars of current share price, only 10k of call options so 4 million shares notional

That's straight up 10% of float that is in options within 2 dollars of share price expiring within the next 10 days, this shit is gonna be volatile af and I wish I knew how to figure out how to play tomorrow but alas I'm too dumb, as IV gets crushed though all these strike points are going to become pretty strong gamma inflection points is my guess. 

Another interesting point is that the borrow rate has increased from 11% or whatever a week ago to 28% yesterday and today. 

Catalysts for today's call

* Management still hasn't really given Microsoft revenue details
* Addressing Cohen's concerns
* GME stopped buybacks until 2021 but given the new administration which may try to limit buybacks is there a chance that management yeets their roll into share buy backs before Buyden and co. run things?

How are you playing earnings? Anyone looking to buy any dips in AH?

I'm pretty much just standing pat rn, maybe 10% of my position is in calls expiring January and the rest are further out calls/shares so I'm just gonna ride this thru if we dip hard and probably cry to you all about it or whatever. Don't really have much more money left to buy any dips unfortunately",2020-12-08 15:52:03
Taking the cue from Cohen,0.9,"So as it seems that us retards are being seen by the outside world as somehow starting to have some credibility (see Jim Cramer's shoutout) and that we seem to have a fairly significant chunk of the outstanding shares. I think we should use this to our advantage as GME shareholders to walk the board through what should be done to come out on the other end of this by making a more detailed next steps letter than Cohen did.

I believe we all are uniquely positioned to give a fairly accurate VOC (ELI5: Voice of the customer, basically a company surveying customers to see what they want so that they can sell shit to them) since we are all playing video games on some device while our wife goes on dates with her boyfriend.

I wanted us to lay these ideas out that we believe will help the company and then we can get one of the less retarded of us to send the best ideas in a letter to the board.

To start off, one idea I have to leverage the current brick-and-mortar locations is to create a return partnership with these e-retailers like Amazon has with Kohl's but specifically for gaming returns. Kohl's uses it to increase foot traffic by giving the person returning something a receipt with a Kohl's coupon which greatly increases the likelihood of making a sale.

TL;DR: Comment with your best ideas for GME to start making tendies so that we can make tendies with them

Why you should Short DOORTRASH,0.95,"I worked for Doordash for nearly two years. I didn't get fired, and this post will be solid DD about how their business operations are dogshit, not me whining because I was underpaid or let go(tho I was underpaid).

**1) The fucking network goes down constantly, their tech is trash**

Go read /r/doordash_drivers or any other employee sub. AT LEAST once per month, on a Friday or Saturday night, the ENTIRE network goes down for at least 1 hour. What happens when the entire network goes down? All restaurants still have to be paid for the food they made, and all orders have to be refunded to customers, who also demand refunds because their tendies were late. Yes, sometimes companies shit is fucked, Facebook has an outage sometimes too. But it happens to Doordash constantly, BEFORE COVID doubled their order volume.

Regarding their tech - here's how the process is supposed to work.

1)You punch in an order for tendies.

2) The restaurant gets a little ping on their tablet saying ""Order? Ya takin this brah?"" (or, LMFAO, the Doordash CALL CENTER CALLS THE ORDER INTO THE RESTAURANT, YES, THEY REALLY DO THIS)

3) The restaurant clicks accept and starts making the food.

4) The Doordash Network does the travelling salesman optimization poorly and offers the order to drivers.

5) A driver accepts

6) The restaurant hits a ""confirmed rdy"" button and the driver, notified via text message comes in an picks it up.

At EVERY single point in this process, with regularity, I would see evidence that the Doordash system sent the process forward without confirmations. If a restaurant didn't turn their tablet on that morning? Doesn't matter, I'm at the restaurant now asking about an order that they never knew they had, but SOMEHOW confirmed it was ready - despite having a tablet with a dead battery. I'd have my phone in one hand with the ""Order Ready For Pickup at Tendie Shop"" text message in one hand, and be holding the restaurant's dead tablet in my other hand.

Customers would call me, two seconds after I left the store having hit ""Picked Up"", asking me where I was, because the app told them I was outside.

What happens when their network delivers confirmation notifications that are lies? Lost money.

Uber has algorithms that automatically price rides and orders. The price changes with demand. What does Doordash do? Charge the same for every order, and pay drivers ""boosts"" in minimum increments of a half hour. So what happens is every Friday or Saturday night, there will be a ""2$ boost"" on all orders from 5pm-9pm. But let's say the system is still saturated at 6pm - then they add a boost from 6pm-9pm for another dollar. But if it dies at 7pm, they can't take the boost off. And if it's overloaded on a Sunday, they basically never add one no matter what. I suspect this is because they don't have an algorithm, they have people they pay to look at network data live and make decisions (poorly).

**2) They don't know how to run a fucking business**

Repeatedly, I would be placed in situations where the simple and proper customer service thing to do was A, but because it saved half a dollar in the short run, I did B and fucked the customer over, because Doordash wouldn't pay me to do A.

Here's an example. New Year's Eve, 230am. I get a double order from a Chinese restaurant. One going way North, one going way South. I live North past the North order, gonna go home after.

The way double orders work is that drivers get paid a little less, because it's only one pick up. No problem, that's fair!

I get to the Chinese place. They have North order ready, but not South order. They say it will be 30 minutes for South order.

I call Doordash support (more on them in a moment). I explain that the next customer's order will be delayed.

Here are the possible outcomes :

A) Out of the kindness of my heart, I waste my gas (and miss out on pay!) to make North Customer happy, I deliver his order right now, and then come back and get South Customer's order.

B) I sit there for 30 minutes and let North Customer's order get (c)old because they won't pay me extra to deliver it separately, even though it's now two orders.

What do you think happened? They wouldn't pay me. I'm an ""independent contractor"", I don't run a fucking Doordash customer charity. North Customer's order got cold. I'm sure he bitched and complained rightfully, and Doordash had to refund his food. Doordash saved 6$ by not paying me, only to probably lose this customer and lose the order's revenue anyways.

Let's talk about support now. Every single restaurant I ever talked to regarding support would make me call about any issue, because the Restaurant Support line ALWAYS had a minimum 30 minute hold wait. They just didn't give a shit.

I've dealt with Uber, DD, Instacart, lots of different support callcenters for this shit. DD hires the Phillipinos that don't speak english well enough to work at the Uber call centre. I would have to hang up 1/5 times I called and call again, because the person I got could not fucking understand what I was saying. I don't have some kind of weird speech impediment either I s2g.

Their support are total idiots too. Here's a good one.

I try to deliver Chinese to some people. I hear loud music in their apartment. I knock ten times over 5 minutes. I text them twice. I call them three times in the same period. They won't come to the door.

I leave and go do the next order. Support calls me back, says hey, can you go deliver that order? They said they're sorry. I said sure, i'm only a few blocks away anyways.

I go back, same shit happens again, they don't come to the door. I leave again. Support calls me again 20 minutes later, I say this time I'm not going back unless they pay me extra, I've been back once for free already. Support says sure, we'll give you 5$.

I go back, and deliver the food. This time, they come to the door to get it, and the most obviously fucking spun up meth-head i've ever seen comes to the fucking door. I tell support ""Yo, you should ban these ppl from the app, they're high as fuck and wasting my time"". Support says ""That's a good idea, it says here they say their order didn't get delivered like half the time, probably scamming"".

Next week? I get an order from the same Chinese place to the same address, apartment number and all pop up in my app. Declined, so no problem for me. But DD? You can't ban cracked out scam artists who cost you money?

I could go on and on. Essentially in most instances, Doordash support fails to protect the long term interests of the company, which screws over good customers and lets scam artistry run rampant.

My friends are all hipster foodie millennials and Doortrash has the reputation among ALL OF THEM as the least reliable app, where the app doesn't work, their food goes missing or ends up 3hrs late for no reason. Nobody likes it.

**Doordash is what happens when someone starts a competitor, hoping to get bought out, and then they never get bought. Corona happens and they decide ""oh, maybe we can IPO then and that's how we get rich and get out of this mess?""**

TL;DR SHORT DOORTRASH

Positions, all stock, will be shorting DD with my GME profits soon enough.

Do you want to bet against reddit? I have the answers,0.96,"I have been collecting and analyzing data from popular subreddits. This week I am looking at the options contracts that have been mentioned on the subreddits I track.  Specifically, I am looking at contracts expiring this Friday 12/11.    The data collected for this analysis was collected from 11/29 – 12/5.  For Friday’s expiration there are 186 contracts and 330 mentions of these contracts.  The most popular contract is the 12/11 TSLA 600 Call with 14 mentions.  


The goal here is to track what reddit is following and to see how reddit preforms.  There is this notion that retail investors often fail to beat the market. This is why financial advisors recommend that you buy into the major ETF’s such as SPY.  As historically there have been few people that manage to beat the major Index’s year over year.  My hypothesis going into this week is that I should bet against the trends on reddit as typically the retail investor is wrong.  


Call Data


* Out of the 186 contracts 150 are calls (+80%+ Long)  

* 75.3% of the calls are out of the money

* The out of the money Calls are an average of 23% out of the money. 

* The in the money calls are an average of 19.3% in the money. 


Put Data


* Out of 186 Contracts 36 are puts

* 86.1% of the puts are out of the money

* The out of the money puts are an average of 20% out of the money

* The in the money puts are an average of 8% in the money 


On both the call and put sides the out of the money contracts are an average of 20%+ out of the money.  I am not that surprised as there is a lot of yolo culture on reddit.  It is surprising to see the number of contracts that are out of the money in general.  Out of the 186 contracts only 42 are in the money as of last Friday’s close. 

The most popular calls that are in the money are the 

* TSLA 570 – 590 
* ACB 10.  

The most popular puts that are in the money are all NKLA.  

The most popular calls that are out of the money are the 

* TSLA 600 - 650, 
* GME 20, 
* PLTR 25 - 40, 
* AMD 100, 
* SPY 370 - 380,
* APHA 9.  

The most popular puts that are out of the money are 

* NKLA 15, 
* PLTR 15 – 21, 
* NIO 40 
* ACB 7.  

As I said above my hypothesis going into this week is that the majority of these contracts will end up being losers.  Based on this data I would probably look to sell the 370 Spy Calls and TSLA 600 calls if my hypothesis turns out to be right.  For now this is just for fun, but I will be running more in-depth analysis to see if I find anything interesting. 

Edit For reference as of 12/7 Market Open:

* SPY 370 Calls: $2.10
* TESLA 600 Calls: $2500",2020-12-07 17:56:58
GME 🚀 Short squeeze explanation from my last post,0.96,"For those commenting on my last post about the GME article just talking about the past.  LOOK at GME earnings call quarters this year and they have all reported negative earnings YET the stock goes up. 

Q3 2020 for Dec 8th, the earnings are expected to be negative as well but the stock will go up. Last Friday was the best time to buy the stock before it goes up this earnings call. 

For those asking about the short squeeze, NOW LOOK at the expected Q4 2020 and Q1 2021. They’re both expected to be positive earnings. So the stock is just going to keep going up and any news about the future and Cohen will keep driving it up. At some point, in theory,  the short squeeze will happen.

*Why are you reading this?* News [just came out that they bought the primary provider of in flight broadband for commercial flights for $400m](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201201005714/en/Intelsat-Completes-Acquisition-of-Gogo-Commercial-Aviation-Announces-Leadership-Appointments) - making them a vertically integrated satellite ISP -> airplanes. Enough potential that they are waiting zero time and are already boasting about it [on their own website](https://www.gogoair.com/commercial/)

> We are the #1 inflight connectivity provider to commercial aviation and now part of Intelsat, the world’s largest satellite operator.

> Together, we’ll move beyond simply connecting aircraft to harnessing the true power of inflight internet to improve how passengers fly and airlines operate. We bring flexibility and performance to airlines and passengers alike across every device, every flight, everywhere.

> Gogo Commercial Aviation counts Aeromexico, Air Canada, Air France, Cathay Pacific, Delta and Virgin Atlantic among its many customers. The unit serves thousands of aircraft worldwide, including both its signature 2Ku installs on aircraft (with ThinKom Solutions’ VICTS antenna) as well as traditional Ku-band IFC installs (with Astronics AeroSat’s antenna).

> “It’s interesting, even during COVID, last month was the highest level of availability on the satellite network we’ve ever seen so the network is working extremely well right now,” says Wade.

This company benefits from travel coming back more than any single airline now, *it connects them all*.

Did I mention they are trading for $0.47 a share? Get them before the world wakes up to what just happened.

Three ways to go forward, pick one, pick all, pick none - it is up to you. I will be collecting dimes over here in the mean time. Whichever one you pick, do not even find out the theta - get shares and hold them, that way every time you log in you can see green numbers for the foreseeable future instead of for a few days.

We shall conclude the discussion here for now, squabble among yourselves and find me again next year when these finally grow your stacks. Maybe by then, you can just buy GME rather than beg the entire place to help you.

# GME Short Squeeze to 19+ Before Falling of a Cliff for Earrings?

GME has been in a rounding bottom since 11/30 and is 2/3 the way complete. The rounding bottom is a consolidation pattern.

It appears that a hidden bear wedge is forming - this could indicate downward projection.

If GME makes it up to the 18.30 - 19.30 range, expect a top and downtrend to appear. Perhaps just in time for earnings cliff dive?

Be mindful of a position fake out and GME to begin forming a cup and handle - bullish pattern.

Recommended Positions:

HEDGE:

* 17c 12/11 exp and 17p 12/11 exp.
* If GME passes 17.44 with volume, play 17.5c 12/11 and trim around 18-19.30 area.
* If GME falls below 16.5 with momentum, play 16.5p 12/11 exp.
* And take profit at around 16-15.12 range.

# THE NIGHTMAN COMETH ONE LAST TIME to TALK ABOUT NIO

Possible long squeeze happening with NIO due to china delisting fears. IMO. They won't get delisted.

&#x200B;

Last ""Thursday, an analyst gave a negative view of China's EV industry, sending NIO's stock lower by 5%. UBS issued a note on NIO rival XPeng, cutting its rating from buy to neutral based largely on the huge run-up in valuation that XPeng had seen. NIO investors seemed to take that message to heart as well.""

&#x200B;

NIO is in a healthy downtrend channel and needs to hit support at around the 38.18 range to complete. It should bounce off resistance and head back to  39-40 level where it may find some resistance. If it breaks resistance at that level, anticipate NIO to climb to 41-42 range for the second resistance level. It may bounce or may exit the downtrend since the pattern will technically be complete. If it jumps out expect a  PT of 42-45 within 3-4 days of the breakout.

If NIO fails to break the first resistance level at 39-4o level, anticipate it to drop to the 38-36 range.

&#x200B;

NiO shouldn't go lower than 30. 30 PT is a danger zone. We are getting near the bottom so be mindful of your indicators and oscillators.

&#x200B;

# Suggested plays for NIO:

&#x200B;

* HEDGE: 42c 12/11, 42p 12/11
* If NIO breaks 44.28 resistance, convincingly, play a 44c 12/11 exp and trim or take profit at 45.11 - 51.93 (not getting even close to 51) range.
* If NIO breaks support at 41.16, convincingly, play 40p 12/11 exp and trim or take profit at 38.18 - 29.06 range.
* I recommend you let your hedge expire worthless or you could try to sell you put at the bottom and keep your call for on the way up - this is WSB after all.
* BIG BRAIN with bullish sentiment for next week towards NIO might hedge with a 42c 12/18 exp. and 42p 12/11. If you take that strategy. Good luck friend. Diamond hands.

&#x200B;

I may pay a visit from time to time.

&#x200B;

Let's make money together.

$GME Earnings 12/8/20 – Will Gamestops’s Shops Shock the Stock?,0.89,"> It’s 12/8/20 and you’re sitting at home in the middle of your 500 sqft apartment in the throes of the third wave of the COVID-flu Pandemic. Like tens of thousands of other former $DIS corporation cast members, you’ve been laid off for months and are bored out of your fucking mind. Who knows how you’ll pay for rent next week? Having stretched your $1,200 Trump bucks as far as possible, you’ve begun considering cashing in and seeing if there’s a market for Sheriff Woody on OnlyFans. You always knew it would come to this; you think to yourself as you gaze upon your old $DIS corporation costume. 
> 
> Fortunately, before you can hit submit on those naughty yet magical pics, an old buddy, Tom Nook, calls you up to drop a fat tip. That’s right, good old Tom got a job working for $GME Stop, and they’re hiring people just like you. After a quick 5 minute conversation, you’ve got yourself a new high paying retail job. Better yet, the company respects your rights, given by God, and doesn’t require you wear a mask or submit to humiliating “health and wellness” checks every morning like Biden supporters and the Fake News love to do.
> 
> Much like investors in $GME Stop’s stock, you’ve hit the jackpot. Everything’s going to be OK; the only Woody you’ll be sharing this Christmas is with your store manager in the stock room.

The COVID-flu hit traditional brick and mortar retail stores like a songbird flying 28 mph into a lit window at night. While most retailers were grossly unprepared to handle the drop in sales and health risks associated with this event, $GME Stop had nothing to lose. In a world where swans are black and coronavirus is fake, $GME Stop ignored health and safety recommendations, securing their status as a coveted ""essential"" business, and putting shareholder value first while competitors were duped and distracted by fads like face masks and toilet paper. Furthermore, $GME Stop has been a bastion of hope for other brick and mortar retailers to aspire to during these unprecedented times - doing things like stocking more than one PS5 on Black Friday unlike Best Buy ($BBY) or Target ($TGT) who “discouraged” us from camping out in front of their stores and “required"" face coverings on threat of expulsion.

With new VR and 3D television technologies on the horizon, and with the rise of Mobile Gaming, financial institutions are sure to be clamoring for $GME Stop shares following earnings on Tuesday. It’s undeniable, millions of Americans are sitting at home, and the demand for adult entertainment has only continued to grow during these difficult times. From the hottest consoles to the sexiest Switch games, $GME Stop is well positioned to pleasure and delight customers across the globe for many years to come.

GME Elliott wave 3 Short Squeeze is coming!!!,0.82,"**GameStop Corp Has Changed Elliott Wave Count**

11/27/2020

Recognia has detected that GameStop Corp (GME on NYSE) has experienced a change in Elliott Wave count. GameStop Corp previously was showing a count of 3 but recent price action indicates that a new count of A is more likely. The new target price for GameStop Corp based on its new wave count is 21.00.

A change in wave count is in itself neither bullish nor bearish. However, it indicates that recent price action now suggests that a better count exists based on the principles of Elliott Wave analysis. This event should be used as a cue to re-examine existing positions.

GME 4Q Bottom Up E-Commerce & Financial Model,0.97,"So, about a month ago I made the observation that GME's U.S. website processes its order numbers in sequential order.

Given that, I made this shitty model that uses the quarter-to-date e-commerce order data, credit card data scrapes from two separate vendors (& sticking my fucking finger in the air), as well as that bullshit finance stuff that nerds use to come up with a 4Q estimate since the sell-side analysts are such shit-head haters and probably work for Melvin Capital (fuck 'em).

IDGAF if this is gibberish to you, but it tells me and the other autists that the analysts are fucking wrong and 4Q20 is going to crush Wall Street's estimates. Yes 4Q20, which comes in March, not 3Q20 which comes on Tuesday.

Feedback appreciated.

TL;DR: My estimate is $4.12, theirs averages $1.83. If mine is even remotely right we all get lots of tendies soon. DON'T BE A PAPER HANDED BITCH IF IT DROPS ON WEDNESDAY

"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning December 7th, 2020",0.95,"Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 7th, 2020.

# **Any progress on stimulus could give the market a boost in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/stimulus-hope-markets-focus-next-week.html)**
*****
> Stimulus to help the economy and vaccines to stop the virus are expected to the be the main focus in markets in the week ahead.
*****
> Efforts to move along a fiscal package in Congress picked up momentum in the past week with Congressional leaders sounding conciliatory, and a bi-partisan group of senators pushing their own $900 billion proposal.
*****
> “It probably boils down to how much [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell is willing to deal, and I don’t know what the answer is to that,” said Mike Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. “If it’s going to happen, next week is the week. The government runs out of money on Friday. Congress has to come up with a funding scheme.”
*****
> Strategists have said the two events could be tied, but Congress could also push through a spending resolution without including stimulus. Some programs will expire at the end of the month, if Congress does not provide funding, including unemployment benefits for millions of Americans.
*****
> The on again, off again stimulus talks have led to skepticism in the market, and sets it up for a move higher if there is anything officially announced. “I wouldn’t think it’s fully baked in. I would say the stimulus is a positive catalyst, unless it’s less than $900 billion,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.
*****
> While stocks surged in the past week, bond yields also moved higher. Yields move opposite price, and bond yields have been rising on stimulus expectations. More spending means more debt, and that sends rates higher.
*****
> The 10-year was at 0.97% Friday, and appeared ready to move back to the 1% level for the first time since March.
*****
> “Is it the case here, stimulus is already factored in, and will people take their money and run?” said Schumacher.
*****
> The S&P 500 gained 1.7% in the past week, ending Friday at 3,699, a record high. The Dow also ended up 1% at a record 30,218, and Nasdaq gained 2.1% to a record 12,464.
*****
> # Getting jabbed
> Vaccine news has been a catalyst for the market’s surge since early November, when Pfizer first revealed the high efficacy of its vaccine. Since then Moderna and Astra-Zeneca both revealed results of their own vaccines.
*****
> A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee meets Thursday on emergency use authorization for the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine.
*****
> “They’re starting to roll it out in the U.K, and that’s something that’s going to be watched here to see how it unfolds,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist Prudential Financial. “That’s the next issue for the market. The deliveries, the distributions. Are people being jabbed? These are all questions the market is concerned about about because they’re looking forward to it unrolling smoothly in the U.S.”
*****
> About 3 million people will be vaccinated in the initial rollout. Moderna’s vaccine is expected to be approved the following week, and by year-end both vaccines are expected to reach 20 million people in the U.S.
*****
> “The vaccine news has started to see a bit of diminishing return in terms of its wow factor,” said Hogan. “There’s going to be some volatility around the logistics.”
*****
> Krosby said the virus remains in the forefront for the market because of the continuing spread and its economic impact as activities are shut down. California Thursday announced new restrictions with stay at home advisories in some regions.
*****
> “The big question is how long does the Covid surge last?” Krosby said.
*****
> The virus shutdowns appear to be behind a slowdown in the labor market, and economists say it could slow activity into the first quarter. November job growth of 245,000 was about 200,000 less than expected. That makes Thursday’s weekly jobless claims more important for markets.
*****
> There is also CPI and PPI inflation data Thursday and Friday.
*****
> “There is this push pull in the market regarding inflationary pressures,” said Krosby. “It’s not expected, which is why if it does print higher, it could ignite the conversation regarding inflation.”

> # Stocks and Bonds Both in Rally Mode

> When it comes to equity market performance in a given month, it doesn't get much better than November. While the S&P 500's total return of 10.95% in the month was only the second-best monthly performance of the year, it was still enough to rank as the third-best month for the S&P 500 in the last thirty years and just the ninth month since 1980 that it was up 10%+.

> The chart below shows the S&P 500's annualized total return over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares the current returns to the historical average. For the last year, the S&P 500's total return has been 17.5% which is nearly six full percentage points higher than the historical average. For the last two years, the annualized return has been nearly as strong at 16.8%, and it is actually even stronger relative to the historical average of 10.5%. Moving further out the time horizon, the S&P 500's annualized returns drift lower, and while the five and ten-year annualized returns are greater than average, the S&P 500's annualized gain of 7.3% in the last 20 years is more than 3.5 percentage points below the historical average of 10.9%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-SP-500-Act-vs-Avg.png))**

> The last couple of years haven't just been strong for equities. Over the last year, long-term US Treasuries, as measured by the Merrill Lynch 10+ Year US Treasury Index, have rallied 15.7%, which is more than six full percentage points greater than the historical average of 9.5%. Over the last two years, returns have been even stronger with an annualized gain of nearly 20%, or more than double the historical average of 9.1%! While the last two years have been strong for US Treasuries, the last five, ten, and twenty years have all seen returns of between one and two percentage points below their historical average.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120LT-Treas-Act-vs-Avg.png))**

> Lately, when you see rallies in the equity market, it tends to be accompanied by a decline in treasuries as yields rise. In November, though, that wasn't the case. Even with the S&P 500 up 10.95%, long-term US Treasuries rallied just over 1%. So how uncommon is it for stocks to rally like they did in November while bonds also rally. Actually, it is not very uncommon at all. The table below shows the nine months since 1980 where the S&P 500's total return in a given month was 10% or more, and of those months, long-term treasuies also rallied in every month but one (October 2011).

> # Manufacturer Recovery Continues

> This morning, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released a less positive outlook for the US manufacturing sector. The headline number for ISM's Manufacturing index fell from 59.3 last month down to 57.5. A drop was expected, but the actual results were worse than the drop to 58.0 that had been forecasted. That reading indicates that the manufacturing sector continued to grow in November but at a slower rate than October.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Headline.png))**

> Similar to the various Federal Reserve bank surveys from around the country, breadth in the November report was more negative than in recent months. Of the ten indices excluding the headline number, only three were higher in November: Backlog Orders, Supplier Deliveries, and Export Orders. Additionally, two indices—Customer Inventories and Employment—showed contractionary readings.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Table1.png))**

> One theme of the report was that orders remain very healthy. New Orders fell from 67.9 to 65.1, but that is a sixth consecutive month of expansionary readings. Although the index was lower this month, meaning new order growth decelerated, it remains in the top decile of historical readings. As new orders have continued to grow, so too have backlogs. The index for Backlog Orders has continued to press higher, rising to 56.9 from 55.7. That is in the 88th percentile of all months and is now at the highest level since August of 2018. Demand continues to improve with new orders coming in at a historically strong pace, even though it is slower than last month, and order backlogs have once again risen as a result.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Orders.png))**

> As new order growth decelerated, so too did production. The index fell from 63.0 in October to 60.8 last month. That is still consistent with growth (readings above 50) in production but at the slowest rate since June. One factor that potentially had an impact on the slowdown in production is issues with suppliers. The index for Supplier Deliveries rose for the fourth month in a row in November and reached the highest level since May. Higher readings in the Supplier Deliveries index indicates longer lead times and vice versa. In other words, products from suppliers have been taking longer to reach manufacturers, in turn, impacting productivity.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Prod-Supp.png))**

> Although suppliers appear to have some constraints and production has slowed slightly, business inventories rose for the second month in a row even as more and more firms report that customer inventories are too low. The index for Customer Inventories now sits in the bottom 2% of historical readings after dropping another 0.4 points in November. At 36.3, the index is at the lowest level since June of 2010. That low reading can be considered positive for future production.

> # Big Gains In November Steal From Santa

> What a month November was! Here are some of the highlights:

> * Best month for Dow since January 1987 (11.9%) and best November since 1928
> * Best month ever for the STOXX 600 (16.7%)
> * Best month ever for the Russell 2000 (18.3%)
> * Best month for the S&P 500 (10.8%) and Nasdaq (11.8%) since April 2020
> * Best month for Dow Transports since October 2011 (12.1%)
> * Best month from PHLX Semiconductor Index since March 2003 (18.4%)
> * Best month for Industrials (16.0%) and Financials (16.8%) since April 2009
> * Second best month ever for energy (28.0%)

> A way better than expected earnings season, a likely split Congress, and major breakthroughs on the vaccine front all helped stocks soar last month,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Add ongoing support from the Federal Reserve as the cherry on top and we are looking at a truly historic month on many levels.”

> Here’s all the Dow monthly returns since 1900. Last month was the best return since January 1987. Now before you go out and sell because you see 1987, remember the S&P 500 added another 20% the seven months after the huge gains in early 1987.

> It was the best November for the S&P 500 since November 1928.

> Small caps soared on the likelihood of taxes staying lower due to a divided Congress and vaccine progress, with the Russell 2000 adding more than 18% for the best month ever, topping the previous record from February 2000.

> What happens after a big month? Well, history says a 10% monthly gain is quite bullish. In fact, we had a 10% plus rally back in April 2020 and shared this same chart at that time. Sure enough, returns have been strong this time around as well. “The bottom line is the huge gains in November could actually be the start of something much stronger,” according to Ryan Detrick. “Also, this was the second month of 2020 with a 10% gain. The only other year to do that? 1982, which kicked off a historic bull market.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

> Turning to December, this month is widely known to be quite bullish, as Santa comes to town, people feel good, and stocks tend to do well. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1950, December has been the second best month of the year, with only November better. December had been the best month of the year until the historic 9.2% drop in 2018. As a result, December hasn’t been quite as strong over the past 10 and 20 years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

> Breaking it down even more, a big rally in November can potentially steal some of December’s thunder. As after a 5% or 10% rally in November, the returns in December are more muted. The flipside to this though is if the S&P 500 is up more than 10% for the year (like 2020), then stocks have benefited from some performance chasing and have tended to do better.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**

> What does it all mean? After the historic move in November we wouldn’t be surprised to see below average returns in December. We do believe this is a new bull market and lasting economic cycle of growth, but overall sentiment is getting quite stretched and this increases the potential for some near-term weakness.

I sold all my current positions, and went all in on GME.

There were a lot of fake entries, so let me address that.

**1) These guys are not good at what they do**

Most of the fake entries are obvious, for example [here](https://imgur.com/YDgeFOm) and [here](https://imgur.com/DamT0zE).

Others are less obvious, with random numbers spread out over a wider period of time. But it's not easy to create legit-looking entries and have an impact since they can't see the whole data set.

There were so many that I couldn't go through all the responses in a detailed way, and was more conservative to exclude more responses than necessary. Unfortunately, I'm also hiding the category column and grouped duplicates, outliers, fake entries into the Excluded category so that I don't provide any helpful feedback to fakers. Apologies for removing transparency for the sake of countering spoilers.

If we really wanted to stop the fakers, we would ask for email addresses, but then no one would fill out the form. But it doesn't matter anyways, because...

**2) Fake entries don't even matter much, since it just has to be in the ballpark**

Surveys have a huge margin of error and only have to be directionally correct (see recent political polls). The fakers think they're playing 4D chess but are actually playing Candyland... and losing to 4 year-olds. They have the logical skills of GME shorts (which they probably are). 

**3) The main benefit of the survey is social proof**

From all the responses and all the shares, it's obvious we are a force to be reckoned with. We hold great power, and with great power come great tendies. The next time you get weak hands (next Wed), remember everyone else holding until a squeeze. Even if you have the most delicate, princess hands, hold at least through Q4 earnings and the annual shareholder meeting in April.

$GME is a SCREAMING buy. But AFTER earnings…..,0.6,"Obviously, $GME Q4 results are a day of reckoning for this business. I have long been tracking this company but I only recently got in with some skin in the game (disclosure – I own \~3000 shares; I am also new to WSB:)). I also think Q3 is an important moment for the company given the institutional dynamics, but **I do NOT think holding through 12/8 would be a good gamble** (which is why you are seeing several people sell their shares to buy in later). Instead, I think there is a better way to play earnings on 12/8.

First off, as everyone knows, Q3 results are going to be ugly. Some have made the argument that the market has already priced this in, but this is only partially true. **Market pricing is dictated by both event-driven probability and hype.** I would guess that the probability of GME missing consensus estimates is \~50/50 (note missing consensus estimates is different from negative growth which is guaranteed in this case). Nobody knows where things will shake out, so the market will price it as such. However, there is a tremendous amount of hype around this stock (for good reason in my humble opinion), which is why I think this stock is trading well heading into an earnings announcement for a turbulent quarter.

Now, **one way to estimate performance is by using credit card activity as a proxy for performance**. We can then use this and compare it to consensus estimates by research analysts:

*Same-Store Sales*

* Telsey: -27.0% (as of 12/2/20)
* Wedbush: -20.0% (as of 12/4/20)

**If you look at credit card data scrapping services, it looks like the quarter will end down around 25 – 30%** (based on the service you use). Obviously this is close to the Telsey number, but its worth noting that these credit card services slightly overestimated performance in Q2 (so the number will likely be closer to -30%). **Therefore, I have a feeling that this stock is going to sell-off significantly**, **making it a much better entry point versus pre-earnings.**

**Personally, I am still long this stock, but it seems like the stock is going to drop in the immediate aftermath of the earnings release, which is why I will be holding off from buying on Monday. I’m definitely going to scoop up some more after earnings however!**

Liquidity question,0.81,"Been trading shares for several years, made some fun money. Made a bunch, lost a little.

NVAX @ $21 (still holding)
TSLA @ $291 (Post Split)
GME @ $4 (Sold WAY too soon)
SHOP @ $500-ish (made $$ but sold WAY too soon)

I make good money, and have $100k or so that I play with in E*Trade.

I want to start losing everything on Options, but have some questions to make sure I do it as efficiently as possible:

How liquid are ITM options?

If I pick up some TSLA 12/31 $600c, and the stock touches $625, how quickly would I be able to dump the contracts?
is it as quick as with shares?

If I buy $600c contracts, but the price goes down, I’m out only the premium I paid right?
Conversely, if I buy $600p and the price goes up, I’m only out the premium?

It’s only if I “write” contracts that I’m obligated to buy or sell those shares.

Also, I seem to catch on to what you guys are suggesting a little late. I am usually looking at buying into whatever your talking about while it’s near the top (PLTR @ $27.60) What keywords should I be looking for in your retarded posts that will clue me in to what is going to happen before it starts moving? Is it the DD Flair?

Boomer Dad contributing to the GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀!!!!,1.0,,2020-12-04 21:14:55
Next Major Position,0.91," 

Well well well, its that time of year for me to write a DD post for the 50 odd people that will see it and the 2 people that will actually read this fuckin thing but here goes. Boomer stocks; especially AT&t and GE, are generally looked down on by this forum and for good reason. I took a look at Stocktwits and when AT&T moved up 1 FUCKING percent, people were freaking out, acting as if the messiah had returned or some bullshit. Well, I have reason to believe it's going to move a lot more than just 1 percent over the next month.

First: Potential Price Upgrade?

Currently, Morningstar has a price target of $37 per share, a very nice increase from the current stock price. This is primarily because of Time Warner's willingness to move forwards and keep releasing movies (Some pretty big names such as Godzilla, Mortal Combat, and the Conjuring), even with the Vurus shutting down theaters across the country. Also, AT&T is bidding out DirectTV (even at a potential loss), freeing up its assets for better opportunities.

Second: Technicals:

I will link another post with some technical voodoo in it, but they look good according to my crayon vision. Again, within the next year this could easily hit $37 per share, considering this still has not fully recovered from the crash of March.

This is the major reason as to why I am very interested in this stock. Also, because of the incredibly low IV, options are cheap as hell currently, even ITM monthlys.

Finally, if you want to look at my track record, my two major plays this year was a certain vaccine company (Ticker is banned) back in March, managed to make quite a nice amount off of them when the stock went from my buy in at a little over a dollar to my sale of $6 per share, and my latest play was 369 APHA $17.5 Jan 15 calls which printed like mofos. (You can see my shitty dd on these in past posts).

Anyways, I am not a financial consultant and if you buy anything, do it on your own accord please!

GME shares: buy now or after earnings call,0.93,"I've read plenty of DDs, many mention that a bad Q3 has already been factored into the current price (new console money will go towards Q4 and onwards), therefore the earnings guidance presented is what will have an impact on the price.

To the question: under the assumption that guidance should be good (no news of the console cycle not going as expected), I should be buying shares now, since the price should spike with good guidance numbers, right?

I came across an interesting nugget -it seems GME is actually Burry's **largest** position because apparently 13-F filings don't report the market value of options correctly.

**1) Fine Fundamentals**  
-Bigly earnings beat due to [e-commerce](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/01/bed-bath-beyond-bbby-reports-fiscal-q2-2020-earnings.html). No longer the Blood Bath and Beyond that we used to know it as.

**2) Tempting Technicals**  
-Bullish pennant after the earnings gap up.  
-Declining volume signaling bullish consolidation.  
-Valid [Andrew's pitchfork](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/05/andrewspitchfork.asp) meaning price has 80% chance of reaching the pitchfork's median line.    
-Breakout could bring price to $33 by mid Jan.

**3) Sexy Short Squeeze**  
-One of the most heavily shorted stonks on the market [@ 55.63% of float](https://imgur.com/a/qgASlEI).  
-GME is around twice that: so GME squeeze would be like Ragnarok on Beargard, while BBBY squeeze would be like Mt. Vesuvius on Bearpeii - both explosive.

Which made a lot of sense so I picked up a few puts Monday a little after open when it was up about $4.50 at its peak around $50 so they ended up being super cheap. This worked out pretty good so when it spiked back up a little Tuesday I added closer to the money puts to my position. Which has paid off since they are down about 20% in the past 2 days.

 But I just wanted to take a minute and thanks u/maxprtr for his DD that was un related to the memes and look forward to seeing any of your future plays.

GME : 2 Bulls 1 Cup,0.9,"The intention of this post is to correctly identify the patterns in the GME chart, having seen references to a cup and handle starting in 2019. My hands are sore from jerking off your dad so I’ll make this brief. 

A cup and handle pattern is formed [during an existing uptrend ](https://imgur.com/a/W7YOBWS) which GME was certainly not in during 2019. A quick zoom out to the weekly chart [makes this pretty obvious.](https://imgur.com/a/H0kWHLI)

What you’re [seeing](https://imgur.com/a/XU9Hl08) is [basing](https://imgur.com/a/dsi8C5M), a period of consolidation where a downtrend stops but before the next uptrend begins. Very bullish if you catch the breakout, which was around $5.

The cup and handle pattern [has formed over the last 6 weeks](https://imgur.com/a/vHAWzv4) and is quite beautiful. However, if you’re playing this pattern you aren’t supposed to buy until it bounces back up and breaks the top of the cup. A lot of you have this cost base at $18-19 but got in too early and before the pattern is completed. If it completes the target is [around $26](https://imgur.com/a/WyKZZjI), though with other factors could be higher. 

Tl; dr: GME 🚀 likely, not fully confirmed and you missed the optimal entry point a long time ago

Exhibit 2: GME share price vs time, see the 6m chart at https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/

The pattern is clear, every spike in price is coincident with more short interest opening up to drive the price lower, which works in the short term (<1 week timescale), but not further. My interpretation is that the spring is being compressed, but at big risk to the short sellers, is this incorrect?

I've come to the conclusion that while it can't be timed, it is as sure of an investment as one can make if you're willing to hold through the bad days.  Most of my account is in shares/calls.

At some point this is going to squeeze, and the ridiculous gains will end.  If cohen takes over, it'll be a great long term play to buy back into, but the movement won't be as explosive once he is active.  I'm not really sure what I'll do at that point.  There are lots of other opportunities, but it will be like pulling in a red snapper right after you landed a marlin.  Sure the red snappers are nice, but the marlin kind of ruined it for you.

Anyway why not start a campaign to write the SEC to look into the over shorting of GME. I have been trading since 89 and I have never seen a stock with more shares short than the float. there is 25.91 million shares short more than the float of the stock. I have witnessed EXPE, ROOM, HLF and Volkswagen shorts, but never seen anything like this. How do you even short anymore than the float ? do you just make up shares which is illegal under the guidelines and trading rules.  

Then how do you get 65.16 million shares outstanding and 67.45 million shares short. Even if the float wasn't enough they shorted 2.29 million shares over every share ever issued in this company. How is it even possible? The answer is it isn't and it's illegal

Look at fucking $BABA and $JD chilling, huge market cap companies not panicking on a vote tomorrow,  know why? Because there's no fucking chance in hell they get de-listed.

Even if this vote passes, the companies get THREE YEARS to comply with the US about their stock exchanges being audited by US companies. Before you say NIO is audited by an American company, no it's not, it's a Chinese branch of that company and the US wants their own hooligans in there, which by law in China is not allowed because Chyna #1

Here's why you shouldn't panic:

Look at fucking Baillie Gifford and Company who own 8.91% of NIO who KNEW about the bill proceeding to the house from passing the senate in MAY 2020. They increased their ownership by over  ELEVEN MILLION SHARES, don't know how much money that is my smooth brained companion? That's over a $495M bet on NIO going upsies.

GME breakout imminent = short squeeze imminent = tendies imminent,0.95,"I can't DD better than this (I can't even DD at all besides reading other DDs):

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4csaa/the\_real\_greatest\_short\_burn\_of\_the\_century\_part/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4csaa/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century_part/)

But one interesting thing is just to highlight a section of this DD that actually fulfilled today as promised:

**4) TA - When the stars and crayons align. Here’s an excerpt from our resident astrologist** [u/JayAreW](https://www.reddit.com/u/JayAreW/)**:**

>Ignoring the short squeeze element of GME and just looking at chart action, there are two elements that are important to keep track of. The cup and handle pattern and $15.80.While my trading style is 90% technical analysis, there are certain elements which I shy away from – mainly chart patterns. However, it is important to at least recognize the obvious ones because if you see it, chances are others see it too. The main pattern I keep an eye out for are the massive cup and handle patterns. This is an example from Pring [figure 1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103438112030760/cup_and_handle_pring_fig_1.PNG).The buy signal is traditionally a breakout above the handle, and a good estimate for price target is the distance from the base of the cup to the handle, added to the breakout point. A recent example of this is \[redacted\][(daily - figure 2)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103467937988628/jmia_cup_and_handle_fig_2.PNG). Notice not one, but two failures to break the top of the handle and the subsequent parabolic run. Compare \[redacted\] with $GME and you see almost the same pattern [(daily – figure 3)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103497926082580/gme_cup_and_handle.PNG). The traditional buy signal would be a breach above the red line (\~$15.80). The difference between \[redacted\] and $GME is that \[redacted\] was far more condensed; the pattern played out over a period of a few months where $GME’s cup and handle started in late 2019. Playing this pattern exclusively, I would expect a price target of roughly $27, stretched out over a period of weeks/months and not as explosive as it’s African counterpart (assuming a squeeze doesn't happen between now and then). Typically, any chart pattern calls for a retest of the breakout point, so don’t be surprised if $GME retraces to $15.80 and look for a bounce there as confirmation that the breakout is on. The other important element is the $15.80 price. Not only is it the breakout point for the cup and handle pattern, but it coincides to a price point which I believe was a major short-selling entry point [(fig 4)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103538602442812/GME_big_short.PNG). Notice the nearly 20% gap down on 33 million of volume. This type of action doesn’t just happen with selling alone and I believe massive short positions were opened on that day.This $15.80 then represents a breaking even point for those shorts if they have not closed their positions (and we have no real reason to believe they have). Breaking even is a huge psychological barrier for people when a trade isn’t going their way and often times represents an exit point for crowded positions. Most of the shorts were already underwater - above $15.80 and that water begins to boil. I believe this position is becoming borderline untenable for existing short positions and is a crowded and disastrous trade. So to recap, $15.80 not only serves as an important chart pattern breakout point, but the proverbial “line in the sand” for existing short positions.

Extreme TL;DR = Current cup and handle pattern of GME means if there is a bounce at $15.80, that means breakout is imminent.

And lo and behold, what do we see? The markets ended at $15.80 on the dot, and the afterhours pricing is already back up to $15.92, as foretold by [u/JayAreW](https://www.reddit.com/u/JayAreW/).

What will happen when there is a breakout? Apparently through TA our resident prophet figured out the breakeven point for short sellers is $15.80, and if GME passes the test at the $15.80 support level and begins to climb again, short sellers are gonna start panicking and start buying back share en masse, which will drive the short squeeze. Ooorrrrrr, they can short even MORE to try and squash the price down, but come earnings report on Dec 8th, if either the report was better than expected, or if Cohen, the dude who built a billion dollar fucking dog food company, does a hostile take over for GME due to less than stellar reports, again, that's a catalyst for the stocks to go up, leading again to short sellers getting fucked if they don't start buying back shares.  


If we autistic fucks can see this and figure this out, then FOR SURE the institutions and investment firms who shorted GME can see this and figure this out too. So their move is to keep shorting and not break the line as a whole and hope that we bow out and panic sell. And what are we waitinf for? We're waiting for the firms to panic, break rank, and start to buy up shares to cover their puts. So literally this situation is like two armies staring at each other, each waiting for the other to break their line first and turn tail and run. IT'S A FUCKING WESTERN SHOW DOWN. 

That is why, for all you paper hand mofos, literally stop it. Stop it. Stop selling and HOLD FOR AT LEAST A MONTH YOU PANSY BITCHES! Don't you realize the investment firms are scared, fund managers are gonna get fired if the short squeeze happens, so they're doing everything in their power to keep prices down by shorting, wanting cause fear among average joe retail investors like us? This is the wealth transfer from the 1% back to the common people we've been waiting for! If ONLY y'all don't bitch out and stand the line strong! Just be patient and if calls are too risky, just fuking buy shares then! Then you can factor out the risk of time and just enjoy the tendies at the end of the month!

Lastly, just like what Citron did to PLTR, plain old market manipulation by publishing a bogus report and price target on PLTR and taking money from all the paper hand bitches here, I'd expect desperate boomer firms to try some equal bullshit in scaring you all to selling. Just expect it to come and HOLD DAMN IT. This is the short squeeze opportunity of a lifetime, and you get to be part of history, and one day you'll be able to tell your grandkids how you fucked up, missed the $500 peak cuz you got too greedy, and sold it at $60 instead.

TL;DR = GME, Tendies, Moon.

GME question,0.94,"Hey guys I've been considering entering a position in GME. Even more so after reading u/jeffamazon great post. He laid things out very well and was one of the better DD's on here recently. 

One thing I have been wondering is this, if we do get the huge short squeeze and hypothetically let's say it hits $50. Who is going to buy all our shares when we want to exit? Are the shorts going to be the ones paying $50 a share to exit their positions? Wouldn't they realize this is exactly what we are hoping for and just hold their positions until it drops again? Retail definitely isn't going to buy our shares at that price. Who exactly will be paying us our profits?

Thanks for any answers and Goodluck everyone!",2020-12-01 23:54:09
A message to the paper-handed sissies and 🌈🐻,0.94,"Dear paper-handed sissies & 🌈🐻,

If I’ve learned anything after losing 5k since February, it’s that you don’t lose until you sell. 90% of the trades that I fumbled, due to being a paper-handed retard, mooned soon thereafter. 

If you didn’t notice in the past couple of weeks prior to this slow “sell off” of GME, PLTR, and a handful of others these last few days, there was a large amount of bullish sentiment surrounding these stonks and you more than likely got AT LEAST 1-2 nice trades off before this ball draining decline (if you didn’t FOMO entirely too late). A large number of the bearish posts were being downvoted to oblivion or deleted by shit mods. Weird right. (Insert bull trap) 

Now, if you look at the recent posts regarding these same stonk handles, there’s a growing number of bearish fucktards saying things like “PLTR $10 EOY” & “GME going back to $5”. 🤡 The shorts are getting theirs during this time and are taking what they came for before the inevitable occurs with all of these (our testicles dragging across the moon, Mars, your mom’s chin, what have you 🚀🚀🚀). This is our time to shine. You heard it hear first. (Insert bear trap)

TL;DR - Don’t go against your senses and go all gay bear on us ... we’re holding strong and retail is about to overtake institutional. Don’t go too short on your calls but be sure to lock in these free tendies. 📈

GME $25+ EOY. 
PLTR $35+ EOY.

Charge of the Bill Brigade; GME to infinity and beyond,0.92,"The Chad Bull gazed upon the field and witnessed what he’d wrought.

The Bears in shambles, scrambled to cover, the shorts were overbought.

Among his ranks a cry went up, the Bears were in retreat.

So into the gap the Bull horde rushed, to clinch the Bear defeat.

And as the Bulls pursued the Bears, a grim truth became clear:

The Bears were not retreating, they were not fleeing in fear.

The trap was sprung, the Bulls exposed, the Bears did circle in.

The paper-handed fell in droves, their will was much too thin.

Then in the distance, a clarion call, a bugle sounded out.

A cry was heard, “RALLY TO ME, WE CAN REVERSE THIS ROUTE!”

Upon a white horse, sitting tall, a figure could be seen.

Ryan Cohen rides into the fray, swinging his mighty Peen.

“A TENDER OFFER! A PARTNERSHIP! E-COMMERCE OF GREAT RENOWN!”

And as he bellows his battle cry, the Bears are stricken down.

Bruised and bloodied, the Bulls regroup around their mighty king.

A knot of Bulls in a sea of Bears, the Bears begin to sing:

“GME IS OVERBOUGHT, BnM IS DEAD”

“JOIN US BULLS, SHOW PAPER HANDS,SAVE YOUR FOOLISH HEADS”

And as the Bears advance in waves the stricken Bulls reply:

“YOLO! SHORT SQUEEZE! DIAMOND HANDS, GME’s A BUY!”

And as the Bears fall on the Bulls, the shield wall does hold.

As waves upon the shore they break upon the Bulls most bold.

Wave by wave the Bears attack and wave by wave they fall.

With hands of diamond the Bulls push back, Bear corpses form a wall.

The Bulls ascend onto the wall, it’s here they’ll make their stand.

And as they gaze upon the field Bear corpses dot the land.

And in the eyes of the Bears they see pride give way to dread.

A moment of stillness, the Bears shy back, the Bulls then push ahead.

With Ryan Cohen in the lead the mighty Bulls march on.

“YOLO! SHORT SQUEEZE! DIAMOND HANDS!” the field rings with their song.

Now tasting fear, the Bears lose heart and start to melt away.

The Bulls push forward, the battle won, they’ll dine on tendies this day.

The Bulls still standing, with hollow eyes, watch their foe retreat.

They weigh the cost of their victory; the tendies oh-so sweet.

Their paper-handed brethren laid into an early grave.

“THEY SOLD TOO EARLY”, King Cohen states “TENDIES ARE FOR THE BRAVE”

“NOW WITH THE GAY BEARS OVERRUN, OUR DAY IS NEAR AT HAND.”

“LET THE SHORT SQUEEZE BEGIN NOW, THIS IS MY COMMAND”

“FOR ALL YOU BULLS WHO HELD THE FAITH”, King Cohen then decried,

“TENDIES FOR ALL, WE’LL SOON BE RICH, TO VALHALLA WE DO RIDE!”",2020-12-01 19:23:19

"Lesson of the day - How options work - What are the benefits of call options, and why buy them instead of the stock?",0.93,"I often see posts asking about how new investors should can get into options, asking what the benefit to calls/puts are, etc...   
If people actually appreciate this stuff, I'll be happy to take the time to write up more of these.  


Who am I/What do I do? I'm a fellow autist, but I'm also a licensed portfolio manager and I work for an investment firm that shall remain nameless. I don't trade on their behalf, so I'm free to do whatever I want on my own portfolio. 

&#x200B;

When buying a call (or a put), you're effectively buying the right to purchase a stock at a set price.  
With a call, you are paying someone for the right to buy their shares at a specific price. This is called the **Strike price**. Your contract also has an expiry date. If the stock is below the strike price on/before the expiry, your option expires worthless, and your maximum loss is the amount of money you paid for the contract.  
If the stock is above the strike price on/before the expiry, you can either sell the contract, or hold onto it with the hope of it continueing to go up. At expiry, if the contract is ""in the money"" (profitable), then you have the right to exercise this contract and buy the shares for the strike price.

  
Your call option has several things incorporated in it for the price you pay.

1) you have the time value. How long is left between the day you buy vs the day it expires.

2) Implied volatility of the stock between the day you buy and the day it expires (how much the expected move in the stock is between now and the expiry date)

3) the difference in price between the option's strike and the stock's price

4) The supply/demand factor.

&#x200B;

Let's use real-life examples:  
You buy 100 shares of GME. You're paying  **16.19** per share as of right now. That means you need to invest 1619$ today to have ownership of these shares.

Your maximum downside is 1619$, your upside is unlimited.

If shares drop back down to 5$, you lose 1,119$ \[ (16.19 - 5) x 100 \]  
If shares run to 30$, you make 1,381$ \[ (30 - 16.19) x 100 \]

December 31 2020 16$ call options currently have a bid of 3.15$ and an ask of 3.40$.  
Which means, if you buy at market price, you're paying 3.40$ per share for the right to buy shares between now and december 31st at 16$.  
Assuming you hold until that day, your break-even price is 19.40$.  
However, you only pay 3.40\*100 = 340$ for this right.

If the stock drops back to 5$, your maximum loss is 340$ in this scenario.  
Your upside however, is unlimited.  
If shares run up to 30$ on december 10th, you still have some time value to the options, plus you have some implied volatility, plus you have the movement.  
So, your 16$ calls will probably sell for slightly more than 14$ (30-16).  
At expiry, you'll have the option to either a) sell those options or b) have them exercise, allowing you to buy the shares for 16$.  


The leverage effect comes in the fact that you only paid 340$ for this contract and in the fact that you get the upside of those 100 shares without as large of a cash outlay.  


If you're right on the direction and the timing of your bet, you can make a lot of money.

If you're wrong, this acts as a way to minimize your losses.

This is a war and yes apes, together, strong but do not forget the other side has manipulation weapons that are very precise and can keep pounding the price any sec of any day.

Expect a lot more hit pieces here and in traditional media that are designed to invoke fear in your ability to stay the course.

Recent posts have been right last week on GME and Dollar General now onto the next play. Global Carrier is a HVAC/Refrigerator company. Best in the business. IPO was back in April. Gradual incline over the past few months with no little downward movement. Company has been meeting and exceeding earnings every time. Small divined of payment not a lot but still something. But the real sauce...When Moderna and Pfizer get approval next week from FDA which is going to happen the distribution is going to be complicated. The one company that can handle a majority of this is right here. Guarantee the government will back distribution in America and will pay a huge amount for this to happen safety and effectively. Won’t be a bidding war they will choose the best company and that CARR. Other countries will do the same especially in Europe and this company is world wide. Price target is 45$ or more by December 18th. Why is this important. Options are cheap due to low IV. That is all. Also volume picked up yesterday so good sign?

On higher than average volume.

▶ What does it mean?

🚀 Bulls are winning

🚀 Big players aren't selling the shares they loaded up at $10-$13. Bullish

🚀 It's safer to buy in the second half of the trading day; personally, I usually buy in the last 3 hours and again in the last 5 minutes before market close

 If today's red, the closest trendline support + fib extension is at $15.92. Keeping pocket money in the unlikely case it drops that low wouldn't hurt

Weekly highs resistance since the last cycle is at $20.67, after that the sky is the limit.

▶ Q3 earnings expectations?

🚀 If their guidance shows a stronger focus on e-commerce rather than brick-and-mortar stores, we'll surely see a pump, as that would kill every GME = Blockbuster shorter's theory. Bullish.

🚀 If they don't mention that and the price dumps, Cohen might step in and increase his stake, finally guiding GME into the 21st century. That would be a major squeeze catalyst. Bullish.

The earnings that matter the most though, are in Q4 (March 2021). They will show what a e-commerce powerhouse GME has become.

That said, I'm personally holding through earnings, hoping for a dump and a takeover by Cohen.  ""Worst"" case scenario the price pumps and I can't load up at cheaper prices. 
That's why I'd rather have an amount of shares I'm happy with before earnings.

▶ When do I cash out?

Realistically, whenever you're happy with the profits you've made.

🚀 The price peaked around $60s and the mid $50s in the last two console cycles, respectively. Now that GME has a modern business model it can be safely guessed that it can reach at least previous highs

🚀 No one can tell how high the price will be with the squeeze. I can tell you it's gonna be $200 if that makes you wet your pants, but that'd be wishful thinking cause, again, I can't guess how high it will be. $50 is already a good enough PT for me

That said, I'm happy I feel safe holding shares through earnings, for once.

-Elon Musk

Oh Elon, sorry to steal your thunder. But GME will make TSLA vol look like TLT. Jeff haunting your every accomplishment yet again.

-----

I’m back with the final warning bell. The next time I post in 2021 will be to recap the squeeze’s results and post gain porn along with u/Deep_Fucking_Value, u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT, u/Tomatotowers, and more. *This is the last stop before the moon mission.*

It’s currently not too late. But after Q3 earnings on Dec 8th, it will be.

Here’s a comprehensive GME overview for all new and returning WSB-monkeys. Sit down and grab some tea. This is a long one unlike the previous posts.

**GME Overview:**

The GME story can be broken up into 2 main theses. The first is a deep value play which has credibility all on its own. The second is an infinity short squeeze like we’ve never seen before in history, which has credibility all on its own. When combining the two, you get the trade of a lifetime. 

In all my (albeit limited) days, I have never EVER seen a trade set up like this before. I’ve pored over every source of historical finance material I can get my hands on, and still have nothing to reference to. IMO, this will look more like the 2008-MBS bet, or the Ackman 2020-COVID “Hell is coming” bet, than TSLA, OSTK, KBIO, or VW.

Just a fucking face-ripping, out-of-nowhere, legendary-HOF-ticker bet that will bankrupt some funds and get people fired - and of course, with no community other than WSB’s name next to it in the history books (and if I could pencil in our lovely GME discord hosted by u/BadElf21 and u/RoaringKitty’s YT stream).

Let’s begin.

**Act 1 - The Set Up:**

Q: Why is GME so heavily shorted in the first place? Why are we betting the long? Aren’t they going bankrupt ala Blockbuster? If not, are we just trading this short term like a HTZ/CCL meme stonk?

A: NO. This is a fundamentally solid deep value play at its core.

First let’s go back a few years. We must give the shorts due credit in order to understand where we are now. GME has been profitably shorted since 2013 when the market correctly bet on the digitization of video games and spread of mobile gaming. Some data here:

* GME sales have plunged from $9.5 billion in fiscal year 2011 to $6.4 billion in fiscal year 2019.

* GME Annual EBITDA has dropped from $839 million in fiscal year 2011 (before the last console cycle) to only $111 million in fiscal year 2019.

* Net income has fallen off a cliff from $339 million in fiscal year 2011 to a staggering loss of $470 million in fiscal year 2019.

* In the two most recent quarters alone, GME lost another $277 million.

The shorts are betting on $0. 

However, in the last 12 months, GME has shown that their terminal velocity does not lead to bankruptcy. GME has a strong balance sheet. [Cash on hand is worth over $12 a share. Net cash is worth over $5 a share](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378623-gamestop-revenue-sharing-agreement-microsoft-shifts-sentiment) and is FCF positive (nixing the bankruptcy thesis). They also paid off $125M in debt last month just to show Moody’s they are healthy due to their incoming console cycle FCF (which may lead to possible bond upgrade, enticing more institutional investors).

So give the shorts credit. They had a legitimate case until the last 12 months, when George Sherman (CEO), Reggie Fils-Aime (ex-Nintendo, current GME board member), and others have been conducting a phenomenally well executed turnaround.

That explains why we currently have ~70M shares short out of ~65M shares outstanding - but they’re all now caught on the wrong side of the trade.

In case the severity of the short interest hasn’t hit you yet, **there is a bigger market for shorting GME than the business of GME itself.** This is not even taking into account the long holders ([Senvest, Ryan Cohen, Burry, Donald Foss, Sherman, Hestia/Permit](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme)) which takes ~25M shares out of circulation. So short interest in reality could be around 180%+ of true float. 

A true head-scratcher. 

And a worthy opponent.

But they’re wrong.

**Act 2 - Avengers, Assemble:**

Q: Why am I so sure GME is prime to blow? Isn’t this just another meme stonk hunch driven by WSB and Michael Burry hype? How can a few online gamblers and a few activist investors turn a dying business into a trade of a lifetime? 

Couldn’t the shorts be right? Also, hasn’t it blown already?

A: NO AGAIN.

Let me show you the ridiculous Avengers team we have. By Avengers team, I mean all the bullish cases:

**1) Ryan Cohen**

Iron Man of the bunch, some call him the Dog-Man.

This guy is a crazy entrepreneur. He took on Bezos with a pet food company (CHWY) and won. Let me repeat - he beat Jeff Amazon without AWS subsidizing his loss leaders.

In other words, he built Markk I (CHWY) in a tiny cave with scraps all by himself with his dad, and now that he has billions, he wants to build nanotech Markk 50 (GME). Read up on this guy. He’s as crazy and as smart as they come.

He also wrote a scathing [letter](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf) to GME leadership, but if you read between the lines, he’s not addressing the existing board, who had only been there temporarily. He’s setting this letter up in order to potentially offer a takeover bid (rumor mill - unconfirmed). 

Either way, GME leadership needs to address this letter in the Q3 earnings call on Dec 8th - which means they need to either post a good quarter, provide good guidance, or add color to existing developments.

Otherwise George Sherman (Cpt America)’s ass is out the door and Cohen takes over as the leader of the Avengers through a vote or buyout. Either of which requires shares to be recalled.

One more thing to note about RC. There has been no 13D/A filling since his initial purchases. Which means he is STILL IN. He has not sold a single share. 


**2) GME Leadership and activist investors - Guardians of the Galaxy, Dr. Very Strange Burry, and the old Captain trying to fit in with the youngsters:**


Dr. Very Strange Burry - AKA Big Short Man. Supreme numbers aspie who might have a screw loose but is unmatched at spotting contrarian trades. *Edit 2: BTW for those asking about his holdings drop. He's trimming to stay under 5%, but still has a large position: 

- Q1: 3,000,000 shares worth $10,500,000

- Q2: 2,750,000 shares worth $11,935,000

- Q3: 1,703,400 shares worth $17,375,000


Hestia/Permit/Senvest - Contrarian, activist investors.


Cpt George Sherman - Boomer CEO who knows what he’s doing.


Reggie Fils-Aime - Beloved ex-Nintendo President.


**3) Bond repurchase**
	
GME just bought back [$125M](http://news.gamestop.com/node/18286/html) of debt maturing in 2021. Who cares? Yes - normally this is a nothing burger even for a micro-cap, but if the shorts are betting on $0 - this is clear evidence against that bet.

Secondly, rumor mill has it that this debt repurchase plus positive Q3 earnings/guidance will allow Moody’s to upgrade their 2023 debt to A or maybe higher.

This is HUGE because it allows institutional investors to long GME without further restrictions. In other words, they may not be allowed to long companies with B- debt. Once this is upgraded, more buyers are allowed to come in.

Very underplayed story here.


**4) TA - When the stars and crayons align. Here’s an excerpt from our resident astrologist u/JayAreW:**

> Ignoring the short squeeze element of GME and just looking at chart action, there are two elements that are important to keep track of. The cup and handle pattern and $15.80. 

> While my trading style is 90% technical analysis, there are certain elements which I shy away from – mainly chart patterns. However, it is important to at least recognize the obvious ones because if you see it, chances are others see it too. The main pattern I keep an eye out for are the massive cup and handle patterns. This is an example from Pring [figure 1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103438112030760/cup_and_handle_pring_fig_1.PNG).

> The buy signal is traditionally a breakout above the handle, and a good estimate for price target is the distance from the base of the cup to the handle, added to the breakout point. A recent example of this is $JMIA [(daily - figure 2)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103467937988628/jmia_cup_and_handle_fig_2.PNG). Notice not one, but two failures to break the top of the handle and the subsequent parabolic run.
Compare $JMIA with $GME and you see almost the same pattern [(daily – figure 3)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103497926082580/gme_cup_and_handle.PNG). The traditional buy signal would be a breach above the red line (~$15.80). The difference between $JMIA and $GME is that $JMIA was far more condensed; the pattern played out over a period of a few months where $GME’s cup and handle started in late 2019. Playing this pattern exclusively, I would expect a price target of roughly $27, stretched out over a period of weeks/months and not as explosive as it’s African counterpart (assuming a squeeze doesn't happen between now and then). Typically, any chart pattern calls for a retest of the breakout point, so don’t be surprised if $GME retraces to $15.80 and look for a bounce there as confirmation that the breakout is on.
The other important element is the $15.80 price. Not only is it the breakout point for the cup and handle pattern, but it coincides to a price point which I believe was a major short-selling entry point [(fig 4)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103538602442812/GME_big_short.PNG).  Notice the nearly 20% gap down on 33 million of volume. This type of action doesn’t just happen with selling alone and I believe massive short positions were opened on that day. 

> This $15.80 then represents a breaking even point for those shorts if they have not closed their positions (and we have no real reason to believe they have). Breaking even is a huge psychological barrier for people when a trade isn’t going their way and often times represents an exit point for crowded positions. Most of the shorts were already underwater - above $15.80 and that water begins to boil. I believe this position is becoming borderline untenable for existing short positions and is a crowded and disastrous trade.
So to recap, $15.80 not only serves as an important chart pattern breakout point, but the proverbial “line in the sand” for existing short positions.

JeffAmazon here again: Note Jay and I don’t agree on a few major points, but are nevertheless both seeing bullish action to come very very soon.



**5) Product Mix**

GameStop is expanding their product mix to include monitors, PC parts, and [more](https://gamerant.com/gamestop-vizio-tvs/). GME is no longer a Disc-Drive only store (which is fine itself), but an all-things-tech e-commerce growth start up. Or you can at least bet that’s the narrative.

GIVE ME THAT F-ING CHWY SALES MULTIPLE.

**6) Three signs of a bubble: leverage, lack of liquidity, and consensus.**

This is an inverse bubble - it will rise as quickly as other bubbles drop. KBIO and VW are often quoted as short squeeze examples. Those are wrong comparisons. The only similarity is the fact that shorts were involved.

Instead, think of any other market bubble. It’s simply about leverage, lack of liquidity, and consensus. We have all 3 in GME. Everyone thinks GME will go like BlockBuster to $0 and is using leverage to short (by definition and current SI).

So instead, think of Burry’s 2008 MBS trade, Ackman’s 2020 COVID trade, PTJ’s Black Monday Trade, or Chanos’ Enron trade. 

Same thing, different direction. Will go up as fast as the others went down.

And oh boy do we lack liquidity. Crowded party, one exit.


**7) Phenomenal numbers due to current console cycle.**

$GME bull Rod Alzmann [(Uberkikz on Stocktwits)](https://stocktwits.com/Uberkikz11) has great breakdowns on Q4 EPS/order count due to console cycle. He tracks orders by order number among a slew of other information [here](https://twitter.com/RodAlzmann).

Check out his models. In short, we expect over $5 EPS in Q4 base case. Which is bananas.


**8) MSFT Partnership gross margin**

GME is getting free money from Satya Nadella.

[Conservative estimate $180M, 100% margin for 2 years](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378623-gamestop-revenue-sharing-agreement-microsoft-shifts-sentiment).


**9) January and April option OI**

OI in option calls for Jan and April are almost 4X that of Decembers. Is GME going to exercise the ITM calls for a squeeze? Why are they so insanely large? Who are these buyers? WTF are they doing?

No clue. But something is about to go down.

Note put call skew isn’t that low, so no infinity gamma squeeze yet, but it will come as GME obtains meme status.


**10) Most importantly, YOU.**

CNBC and other misled, egoistic mass media companies and institutional investors continue, time and time again, to look down upon the new generation of traders and laugh at WSB.

Tell me, which one of them has read all of Moody’s credit reports on GME? Which one of them live streams collaborative GME DD 20+ hours a week for 6+ months straight? Which one of them tracks order flows by the f-ing second based on skimmed CC data? Who scours r/GameStop to see how leadership is treating their employees and customers at a testimonial level? Do they even know about the bond repurchase?

They don’t know jack s-.


**Act 3 - The Trade**

What more evidence do you want? Time for action.

First, the PT. u/ronoron summed it up well:

> A 3 billion market cap (not even 0.5x of their revenues) would already leave GME at $46/share.Going back to their 2013 peak at around 6 billion market cap would leave them at almost $100/share already, not the $56 peak/share. The algos trading still can't appreciate the fact that GME halved its number of outstanding shares a while ago.

> For comparison. Bestbuy is trading at almost ~0.7x of revenues with lower gross margins. Nordstrom is almost at 0.4x of revenues despite the bigger liability their department stores are having through corona (never mind their uglier balance sheet). GME is still hovering just above 0.2x revenues because stinky shorts overestimated how bad corona would be for GME (e.g. delayed console cycle, digital consoles becoming widely popular).”

PT can easily be over $100. The JeffAmazon target is $420 which gives them about ~$25B market cap at a P/S ratio of 5, maybe 4 with console cycle revenue. That wouldn’t even be considered an euphoric price with today’s growth stocks. For comparison, NVDA is 22, TSLA is 20, and CHWY is 5.

Timing:
This all hinges on Dec 8 earnings. If GME misses (it historically has), Cohen will use this opportunity to attack leadership and take over as CEO. Therefore, GME leadership needs to provide a great earnings report or else Sherman will lose his job.

Here’s my responsible trade (do whatever you want): All in calls and shares now. If IV and $GME is sky-high before earnings, sell half to secure profit. If GME misses and tanks, bet your bottom dollar a takeover bid will be announced shortly.

In all honesty, I'm going to probably hold everything through earnings WSB style.

My positions:
1/15/21 $30Cs, shares

(I would buy April $30Cs too, but I'm all tapped out of cash).

Shorts and longs both have their cases. All the cards are on the table. Which side are you on?

-------

If I missed anything, comment and I will update above. I’m aiming to make this the final stop for all high-level GME DD.

*Edit 1: Educate yourself right now on IV crush (in short, we expect a lot of vol now, so option prices are high. After earnings, expected vol normally decreases, so your option prices will normally drop).  GME is the king of IV crush after earnings. If you're playing FDs, prepare to get destroyed like always. Safer bets are LEAPs or FDs after earnings.

*Edit 2: All these beat earnings recently: SNE, MSFT, BBY, BBBY, NTDOY, ATVI, TTWO, JWN, M, KSS",2020-12-01 03:38:42
Calculating what the GME price should be for shorters to get in the red,0.96,"Assumptions:

A person/institution borrows N shares from a broker at time t=0, at the price of P\_0 per share, and with the interest rate r. Equivalently, the shorter has borrowed N\*P\_0 dollars.

The person/institution can cover the short position (buy back the shares and return them to the broker)  after T periods at the price of P\_T, and make a gross profit (not considering the costs of borrowing) of N(P\_0 -  P\_T)

The costs to the shorter: interest paid + opportunity cost of what could have been done with the money (let's say buying an index ETF with an R% annual return is a relatively safe alternative).

So in the end, the shorter makes a loss if:

gains < costs

N \* (P\_0 - P\_T) < N \* P\_0 \* \[ (1 + r + R)\^T - 1\]

Cancel out N from both sides:

(P\_0 - P\_T) < P\_0 \* \[ (1 + r + R)\^T - 1\]

Let's give our parameters numbers. If the shorter started their position in Nov 2015 (5 years ago, so T=5) when the price of GME was $40 per share, with an interest rate of r = 5% per year and the opportunity cost (the return on an index fund) being R = 4%, solve for P\_T

40 - P\_T < 40 \* \[(1 + 0.05 + 0.04)\^5 - 1\]

40 - P\_T < 40 \* 0.54

40 - P\_T < 21.5

P\_T > 18.5

So for this shorter who started its position at such a high price ($40) 5 years ago, the price should go above $18.5 to get them in the red.

This could explain why they fought so hard to keep the price below $18 today.

Feel free to play with numbers for shorters who may have entered their position at different times (and so different prices).",2020-12-01 03:34:03
$GME Infinite Short Squeeze,0.96,,2020-12-01 03:32:44
GME is the Most WSB Move in the History of WSB,0.86,"Think about it...

1. Declining macro environment ☑️ - GME is a brick and mortar retailer in the age of e-commerce whose demise was nearly certain before COVID-19, and then COVID-19 accelerated the process. 
2. Rapidly declining revenue ☑️ -  YoY quarterly revenue growth has been negative for past 5 quarters.
3. Business model not becoming more efficient in digital era ☑️ - Gross margin has steadied around 28% since 2018.
4. ""Smart money"" betting against the stock ☑️ - Hedge funds actively betting against GME's survival with short % of float at 297.3% (as of Nov 13).
5. Familiar (and I assume identifiable) movie character, stock genius backing it ☑️ - Michael Burry notoriously bet against the rest of ""smart money"" and the housing market in the Financial Crisis of '08 famously depicted by The Big Short.

In the face of a dismal macro environment and worsening company fundamentals, you retards of WSB have bucked any sort of common sense and relied on each other to squeeze Wall Street's nuts and sent GME to levels not seen since late 2017. In the process, WSB has funneled $s upon $s from top Wall Street hedge funds, minted several millionaires, and multiplied many more retards' net worth. Embodiment of Robinhood in its finest form. As an innocent bystander, I fear for the future of some of your portfolios, but I get that ""as long as the music playing, you've got to get up and dance."" I just hope you've distanced yourself from the punchbowl and are eyeing the exit. Til the break of dawn yo!

Edit: This post is inspired by jealousy, admiration, and slight concern. Just calling it as I see it.

Edit2: For the sake of further discussion, as discussed below in the comments. Assuming constant gross margin of 28%, flatlined SG&A and impairment costs, and a forward P/E multiple of 8x (courtesy of ahminus), to maintain it's current valuation of $16/share, it would have to grow revs YoY at roughly 100%... pretty ambitious considering we can all agree this is not a growth tech company.

CARR (Global Carrier) must Buy Now DD,0.72,"Recent posts have been right last week on GME and Dollar General now onto the next play. Global Carrier is a HVAC/Refrigerator company. Best in the business. IPO was back in April. Gradual incline over the past few months with no little downward movement. Company has been meeting and exceeding earnings every time. Small divined of payment not a lot but still something. But the real sauce...When Moderna and Pfizer get approval next week from FDA which is going to happen the distribution is going to be complicated. The one company that can handle a majority of this is right here. Guarantee the government will back distribution in America and will pay a huge amount for this to happen safety and effectively. Won’t be a bidding war they will choose the best company and that CARR. Other countries will do the same especially in Europe and this company is world wide.

PLTR or GME?,0.8,"Ok fellow gamblers, 

I’m a broke early 20’s graduate student looking to make some extra bucks. This PLTR drop since Friday has brought be down to my knees and I’m in half a mind to sell my calls (keep the shares i have) since I’ve already bled so much (50%+) (Position: 12/31 35c PLTR). 

I’m wondering if i should just sell my calls and buy as many GME shares as possible before earnings or should I hold on to my position and hope for the best? I literally do not want to lose anymore money because i’m at an all time 50 buck high after this PLTR shitfest. 

What do y’all think?",2020-12-01 03:03:28
GME Explanation,0.93,"Alright listen up I'm about to give a basic explanation of the GME situation and why there is potential for a short squeeze (feel free to add more info in the comments). GME share price has been increasing steadily for the past few months. Every Release of a new console rapidly increases the price per share of GME such as in 2007 with the release of the PS3 and Xbox 360 and in 2013 with the release of the PS4 and Xbox 1, in both scenarios, the share price capped in the low 40's before falling back into the normal range. Before both of these ""console induced"" surges the price per share was $11 just check out this graph: 

[GME the last 20 years showing a surge of both console releases.](https://preview.redd.it/zhna7ifxjh261.png?width=814&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f82684f1e1f3e94ac1bb9b36373755589ecfd90)

As seen in this stock price history graph price per share drops dramatically a couple of months after each console release. This is just beginning with GME today. THE SHORT TO FLOAT PERCENTAGE OF GME AS OF RIGHT NOW IS 292.53% this is very important. Starting very soon there could be a short squeeze. Since the number of people short selling this stock is insanely high in today's market, there is a very good possibility of a short squeeze. As I said at the start share prices have been rising making short-sellers nervous, as the price increases due to the ""console induced"" surge (and other factors ill link later), the more short sellers will buy back their losses since they are at an infinite risk for loss of money. Since this is likely to cause all of the short sellers to buy back their shorts the insane 292.53% short to float ratio will come into play, this is what will cause the short squeeze... AS THE SHORT SELLERS BUY BACK IT WILL DRAMATICALLY RAISE THE PRICE PER SHARE CAUSING A MASSIVE GAIN IN PROFIT. this is very likely to be way higher than the previous $40 per share cap as seen in the last console surges. This is why a short squeeze is likely and this is why there are millions of more shares owned than on Friday's market close. This is only the start gentlemen and watch as this phenomenon plays out.

Here is the link for more info on the GME situation: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k32h0m/gme\_full\_story/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k32h0m/gme_full_story/)",2020-12-01 02:37:13
PLTR & GME,1.0,,2020-12-01 02:22:59
[DD] GME earnings and option positioning,0.94,"Ok retards it's time to take a closer look at GME now that earnings are coming up on Dec 8th. First of all don't expect earnings beat from GME for this quarter, shortage of consoles and competition from Amazon and Walmart means GME's probably gonna post a disappointing report, they'll probably guide up and highlight their cleaner balance sheet and maybe even talk about restructuring like Ryan Cohen wanted but who knows what gonna happen. So yea it might dump after earnings.

but we ain't here to ""invest"" fundamentally, we're here for the epic short squeeze.  I don't give a shit about their FCF or valuation based on whatever fuckhead analyst's model. Whatever happens after earnings, it's important that we diamond hand this baby and roll your calls instead of just selling it like a weak ass pussy.

IV for options around earnings are huge at \~250%, so there's a good chance that a lot of you retards will get IV crushed (if you're worried buy your calls further out, closer to the money or just buy shares)

What I noticed is that there's a huge open interest of 20k for Dec 18 $17 puts and 12k for Dec 18 $16.5 puts. OI for call options doesn't even compare. Lots of gay bears (or maybe it's a hedge idk)  gonna get IV crushed, which is actually more bullish than you think. Because when those puts expire worthless, MM is gonna close their hedges by BUYING BACK the stock that they shorted when they hedged those puts. This effect MIGHT be very noticeable EOD on Dec 18 2020. In fact, it's probably what happened to PLTR last Friday, when about 30% of all calls expired and MM sold their hedges as your calls expired worthless, leading to a dump.

Do what you will with this information, but MINIMUM pain for MM at that week dec 18 is situated right around the $17 mark, unless the MM gamma exposure changes.

New Spin on an Old Game: Load up on ELY (Callaway) for Top Golf Merger,0.85,"Hello autists,

Take a break from PLTR and GME and listen up for the spiciest merger of 2021. Callaway (Boomer golf company, who previously owned 14% of Top Golf, is now planning to buy the entire company through a stock issuance. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/golf.com/news/callaway-topgolf-ceos-explain-merger/amp/

Why does this matter? Bc golf absolutely thrived during the pandemic, and Top Golf is the fastest growing golf niche in America right now. Let me pull out some stats: Golfers played 20% more rounds of golf August 2020 vs 2019.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/golf.com/travel/golf-rounds-played-increase-2020-coronavirus/amp/

Additionally, Top Golf has experienced 30% yoy revenue growth each year since 2017. Top Golf is operating at similar capacity to pre-Covid thanks to the open bay environment, thus making it a reopening play that was never really punished.

This merger will weigh the company almost 50/50 between Callaway and Top Golf, with revenue streams projected to be around 50/50 too. However, this is a 1+1 = 3 scenario to me. 

Top Golf licenses its ball tracing technology to other driving ranges, a revenue stream that’s up 200%+ yoy. Also, Callaway can now market its gear through Top Golf, while exposing new players to its equipment. This is a merger that just flat out makes sense.

Load up on ELY, thank me later.",2020-11-30 17:23:01

GME support last console cycle was around $17.74. Now premarket is at $17.90. You can still hop in on this rocket,0.95,"In the last console cycle GME went from $17 to over $40. And that's without short squeezes, Cohen's magical dog toys and whatnot.

The price took off after the high $17s acted as support. If you're wondering whether you've missed the train or not, the answer is no.

Buy and hold until at least March, when the ER will include console sales and e-commerce tendies.

TLDR: you can still at least double your profits if you get in at below $20.

For all those of you who missed the pltr and gme train or are too scared to get in (if you are than gtfo of this subreddit), I'm going to show you a company that is so undervalued it hurts and its to take off soon🚀

**So what is Alteryx?**

glad you asked, Alteryx is a data analytics data science company that provides a platform for companies to perform analysis of the data, share it, and deploy lots of analytic models. The platform can be used by business analysts, programmers, and trained data scientists. The company wants to solve the problem of wasting time in the organization for doing simple Data analytics. As for 2020 60 BILLION DOLLARS per year wasted on analysts doing repetitive manual work in spreadsheets. The uniqueness of this company is that the interface of the platform is very intuitive and user friendly, using drag and drop interface and mainly reduces the need to write complex software code. Their platform is designed to interact with almost any data source, starting from IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP to AWS, Google Analytics, Workday, and more.

**Who are the customers?**

So the company has, as of 2020, approx. 7000 customers in more than 90 countries and big names like Netflix, Salesforce, Toyota, Chevron, Uber, Twitter, Xerox, Nasdaq, and many more. The company already has a name in the big boys' playground and we can expect it to continue to expand.

**Tell me more, please.**

No problem amigo. The company continues its growth strategy by a series of acquisitions mainly for developing tools and talented people. in 2019 they acquired ClearStory Data mainly because the developers are very good and can leverage them to help to develop and improve their tools. They acquired Feature Labs to augment their machine learning capabilities and to penetrate to the East coast of the US. Also the company announced strategic alliances with Adobe, UiPath and ABBYY to accelerate adoption of APA (analytic process automation) which altreyx is a leader at.

Alteryx is a subscription-based software which makes it a SaaS company the same as TTD, Shopify and so on, but it focuses on analytics. Their main competitors are the big software companies (IBM, Microsoft, SAP) and some small ones which most of them are private.                  So in order to compare them to check if they are under/overvalued, I will use companies in the same field as Datadog, Splunk, and more.

**Let's dig in for some numbers**

Annual revenue has increased from 86M to 418M in just 4 years (2016-2019) that is a 48% CAGR which is amazing. This year the company expects to grow revenues at around 15% mainly because of covid, which made companies cut expenses.

Q3 revenues growth is 38% YOY, customer growth is 24% YOY.                                                        Gross Margin is 93% (Amazing) Operating Margin is 24%. This company is super efficient and with great margins.

The company is profitable as of the 3Q with a positive EPS of 0.07. It uses more than 50% of its gross profit for R&D which is exactly what we want to see in a growing tech company.

**Balance Sheet**

Cash is down to 95M from 409M mainly because of acquisitions, but short term investments are almost double YOY with 627M. **Current Ration** is 1:4 approx. and **asset to liabilities ratio** is 1.5:1 so the company is indeed solvent and can survive even stuff like covid. Liabilities wise the company has 650M in convertible bonds which as we see can be covered by the short-term investments, It is something we should consider when the company starts to underperform, not now though.

Cash from Operating Activities for the 3Q is 16.3 M an improvement of 20%.                                      FCF is negative for the quarter mainly because of the investments they made (240M).

So the company is performing really well so far this year and is able to grow despite covid and companies reducing expenses. Of course, they need to increase their FCF but as long as they are growing and acquiring companies it's all good.

**Let's use some gay TA to see what's going on**

[AYX 1 day chart](https://preview.redd.it/eu91ywiifd261.jpg?width=1374&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=96335b788ca104400101c7f29fdc13435ce4aac7)

Well as you see AYX is in a range for quite a while (since May) with 104 and 80 acting as support and 150 and 178 as resistance. It hits 104 twice and couldn't break it and in the last 2 weeks, it tried again, and again was denied.

So the stock can now go to 150 easily or contest again the 104 level. with the tech trend going up I can see it going to retest that 150 level hoping to break it.

**Now we compare this company with other companies**

* SNOW: ‘21 EV / Rev = \~100x
* DDOG: ‘21 EV / Rev = \~ 40x
* MongoDB: ‘21 EV / Rev = \~ 25x
* **Alteryx: ‘21 EV / Rev = \~ 15x**
* JFROG: ‘21 EV / Rev = \~ 30x
* PLTR ‘21 EV / Rev = \~ 50x

(thanks  [u/xwpv8j62](https://new.reddit.com/user/xwpv8j62/) for the info)

As you see AYX is the most UNDERVALUED company here which means a lot of room to grow.

Gross Margin:

**AYX- 92%**

DDOG- 78%

SNOW - 55%

MongoDB- 69%

P/S Ratio:

**AYX-  16.95**

DDOG- 51.71

SNOW - 150.15

MONGODB-  30.88

PLTR - 47.76

AYX has the best margin, best ratios, and still is way undervalued than its peers. This is wrong and YOU have a chance to take advantage of it.

**TL:DR,**  Shares and January Calls at 120/130 strike will do the work.

Have fun guys happy trading and tendies for y'all.

"GME ShortSqueeze is not happening, but GME is unvalued.",0.8,"Ok retards, GME ShortSqueeze is not going to happen. But what will happen is the share price will pop. Currently they have a shit load of cash. How come they have so much cash despite losing about 1b over the past 2 financial years and not raising money thru debt or equity.

Well some autist accountant back in the day decided to create some bullshit called double entry. GME bought some companies along the way which resulted in Goodwill. Which is basically the premium above net assets GME bought acquisitions for EB games ect.

As a result GME had a Profit of 74m total over the past 2 years before tax when you add back the goodwill impairment. Goodwill impairment over the last 2 years was roughly 1.3b.

Why is this important? Because the business for the past 2 years has been treated as a bankrupt despite actually holding its own in a digital era. If leadership manage to realise they can get out of most of the lease in the next 2 years and move to an online sale delivery plus pick up in store at foot traffic heavy locations / most profitable stores GME will remain profitable and cash flow positive for years to come.

&#x200B;

Their ITM puts for July (probably bought because they couldn't find any more shares to short with) are now OTM. They probably have an actual short position too (don't have to file that in an 13F) they're also underwater on. No one else has a put position this big in the 13F's.

What are the chances they're responsible for half the short interest? It'd make sense on why we're not seeing significant covering on GME yet. They're a bunch of stubborn boomers that have collateral in the billions. It wouldn't be crazy if they made a $200 million bet on Gamestop becoming the next Blockbuster when it was under $6. They've made similar bets in the past like their $400 million short on Nintendo back in 2018.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u7ttqxuym8261.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b39a443a7d7cdc8d62ede4680a5b540af920f1d

&#x200B;

Of course that $200 million bet would have turned to a $500 million (and growing) that they owe. They might not get a margin call, but surely there's a point where their risk management and exit strategy tells them they have to cut losses instead of paying $100K daily in interests (\~7% APR fee) on a losing position that's getting bigger and bigger.

**Note:** the short squeeze is just a bonus so don't be a paperhand retard. There's more to the GME play than just hoping the short sellers pay for your lambo. GME is unusually undervalued compared to its peers (0.13x revenues if you're basing it on TTM revenues), it can go up without a short squeeze. These boomers still think that digital consoles are going to kill Gamestop even though Microsoft threw them a safety net and that disc consoles are still the vast majority of sales. Surprise surprise, no one wants digital consoles in America when downloading a game uses up their entire bandwidth cap for the month.",2020-11-29 20:29:52

I've come to the conclusion that WallStreetBets is #1 when it comes to finding trends and finding stocks. It doesn't matter if this is after-the-fact that the stock price shot up 50% in 2 days. It doesn't matter that the stock is something nobody paid attention to until finally the whole world start trading it (PLTR). What it comes down to is the fact that WSB will find literally any stock after it has already mooned. Stock up 10% for the day? WSB knows about it. Stock up 20% in the last week? WSB has already traded it. It's genius.

**Here's the kicker**. \*Most\* times after a stock has mooned once and WSB hops on the trend, the stock will go through another 1 or 2 periods of ""mooning"". If you are new to the industry of printing tendies, grab a tequila on the rocks and have a drink with me while I go through some sentiment on the WallStreetBets forum.

&#x200B;

I'm not even going to start with PLTR (Palantir) because that would be too obvious. Let's start with XPEV.

&#x200B;

**XPEV**

Look at this sentiment chart. The stock wasn't even mentioned a single time until some autist found an alternative EV company to gamble on after it shot up 10% in a single day.

https://preview.redd.it/un64jt1z47261.png?width=1608&format=png&auto=webp&s=311103e4373fa04790226cebe751d1d35ca9aa9b

1st wave sentiment peaked at 3% of the sub-reddit's comment volume. What happened next? The stock stayed flat for 7 days and you autists completely forgot about it. Next stop - Wave 2: Comment volume peaking at roughly 5% of all comments after the stock price went from $33 to $43 in one day. Massive spike in chatter around the ticker and the stock price continues it's meteoric climb for a whole month. You can see another 1 or 2 waves where sentiment rises after big moves in stock prices.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**CRSR**

https://preview.redd.it/0scjg83257261.png?width=1612&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbaca71ea742ea0c1431dde33304aa009c277ba8

Next up is Corsair Gaming. None of you autists even knew the stock existed 2 months ago. We can see wave 1 happened early November with small gains in the stock price. Sentiment was steady as autists everywhere were drooling over consistent gains for the first time, loving every minute of it, kind of like when you kiss your cousin for the first time. Wasn't long after we see wave 2 and 3 of the trend where the stock continues it's mission to Mars.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**LI** 

https://preview.redd.it/alxnfwz257261.png?width=1612&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c9ebd19dec396d22ad8146e8fb1732277cd10e0

Next we'll look at LI. 99% of you, including myself, don't even know what this company does. All we know is that STOCKS ONLY GO UP. The first wave happened 3 weeks ago when comment volume reached 5% of all the comments on the sub-reddit. Stock price shot up 30% in a single day. Sounds insane that the momentum would continue upward, but it has. Not only that, the stock price has gone up another 30% in the last 3 weeks.

&#x200B;

**PLTR**

https://preview.redd.it/vs5zaon357261.png?width=1630&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f6c883545d1bf1b550890d7c4ad4518dafdde02

The PLTR sentiment chart is nothing short of magnificent for a sentiment junkie like myself. Comment volume has been rising at the same rate as the stock price. On Friday roughly 50% of discussion comments mentioned the ticker PLTR. Something that you either loved or found incredibly annoying. The only other tickers to ever break the 50% comment volume barrier are Tesla and NIO.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

What's the next meme stock going to be? Is it GME? Do we regress back to PRPL gang? Nobody really knows, but one thing I can agree with is that wave 1 of the trend is almost always the early adopters with gorilla balls willing to risk large amounts of capital on a stock nobody's ever traded before. Once a few believers hop on the train the whole sub-reddit jumps on the bandwagon headed to hell or Valhalla.",2020-11-29 15:21:30

GME FULL STORY,0.96,"  

\- In April 2019 GME brings in former president of Best buy Services named “George Sherman” who has tremendous amount of experience in Brick & Mortar retails. George made huge changes to the company (e.g., hired a former president of Nintendo America in order to solve supply issues for Nintendo Switch during the beginning of Pandemic).

\- As a result, E-commerce revenue grew 500% YTY in Q1 2020 and 800% YTY in Q2 2020.

\- Ryan Cohen, a self-made Billionaire, who co-found Chewy .com shows interest in Gamestop and purchases 9.98% of GME shares. 

\- Ryan Cohen recognizes the booming gaming industry and realizes the goldmine that Gamestop is sitting on with strong brand and 55million + PowerUp members. 

\- Despite George Sherman’s proven success in E-comm sales, Ryan Cohen believes a more aggressive change needs to happen in order to make GameStop Great Again.

\- Ryan Cohen believes that in order to make GME Great Again, it is absolutely necessary for GameStop do the following:

1) Forgo the upcoming 2-year lease renewal on all underperforming stores

2) Non-core operations in Europe and Australia to be streamlined or sold.

3) By cutting cost with the above two methods and with the revenue generated from the biggest ever console cycle, GameStop should invest heavily on boosting E-comm sales.

(Hire proficient E-comm gurus, invest more in GME website and App, secure delivery channels that are better or at least on par with Amazon.

\- Ryan Cohen demands the company to layout the roadmap as soon as possible (\*hint\* December 8 Earnings call)

**2 possible scenarios:**

1. GameStop addresses Cohen’s letters and agrees to implement Cohen’s ideas.

2. GameStop completely disagrees with Cohen as they believe they are on the right track or doesn’t address Cohen’s letter at all.

\- Scenario 2 is where it could get interesting as many speculate a potential hostile takeover by Ryan Cohen. 

My take on this:

\- Ryan Cohen is not a WSB autist. He sees the potential short squeeze opportunity. Ryan Cohen could be holding massive amount of ITM calls which he can exercise and reduce the supply of shares significantly. This way, he could easily takeover the company with the shares his holding and possibly even ride the short squeeze with us. This would force the shorts the cover. Similar to what happened in 2008 with Volkswagen.

[https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/](https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/)

\- Or, Cohen could actually plan a hostile takeover and call up a proxy vote. This could lead to recalling shares by the company, forcing the shorts to cover and triggering the short squeeze.

Icing on the cake:

\- On 12/11/20, GameStop voluntarily pays off debt as their cash on hand deems healthy.

Why GME will survive and prosper,0.83,"Many of you are questioning why there is so much hype behind GME, so let me drop just a small info bomb for the uninformed autists. Obviously everyone is tracking a possibility of a short squeeze, which is just one small part of the overall picture. 

- ""In a seemingly unprecedented deal, GameStop will now share in the lifetime digital sales revenue—including for full game downloads, DLC, and subscription plans—for any Xbox console sold through its stores. How much that arrangement will impact the bottom line for the struggling retailer is still an open and heavily debated question, though.""

GME- what I think will happen next week,0.84,"Too much nonsense about GME rn, I’ll say what I think will happen towards earnings. We should see some coverings next week, out of both fear going into earnings and just out of how much some of them will be losing. These last few moves have been mainly big buying rather than coverings, but that doesn’t matter too much. Technicals are pretty strong right now also. I personally think next week could be great, with a string of 10% days or around that, with some shorts covering. I think we could hit low 20’s next week, then Monday and Tuesday some profit taking before earnings and some more shorting since earnings are anticipated to be bad, like the recent GME earnings. Should have a nice dip right after ER, then from then on it’s all unprecedented. Cohen could buy GME on that dip, depending his plan, how much we dip, if we dip at all, and if he has funding to buy GME anyway. Vaccine approval should bump us a little as well, since GME is still seen as B&amp;M. I will be buying weekly 20c’s at open, but only becuase I’m very confident we go up a good amount next week, don’t do what I’m doing, IV and theta will probably hurt pretty bad.

GME DD Because there wasn't enough of it already,0.95,"I've been seeing a lot of comparisons between GME now and the VW short squeeze back in 2008. For those of you who've been living under a rock, GME's short is currently more the entire number of outstanding shares. This is a very interesting, but the more important fact is that the number of shares sold short is roughly 3x the entire float.

https://preview.redd.it/udkkxz9ok1261.png?width=968&format=png&auto=webp&s=f98f9645d9e2bf94dc3ccbd409f2d2b375be6d91

This is very important, as to cover short positions, MM's will have to buy from the float. The greater the Short % of Float, the greater the squeeze. In comparison, VW had a short float of just under 13% right before the insane short squeeze. Now, roughly 30-35% of VW shares were in the float, with Porsche holding 42.6%, the state of Lower Saxony holding 20%, and about 5-6% held by passive investors. This made the Short % of Float about 40%, far less than GME currently.

&#x200B;

The short squeeze occurred because Porsche announced that they were going to exercise options to buy another 31.5% of the float, taking their total up to 74.1%, and had plans to hold 75% of VW the following year. This triggered a squeeze as shorts rushed to buy to cover before Porsche exercised the options. As you can see from the graph, VW's share price jumped nearly 5x, and then quickly fell back down.

https://preview.redd.it/p8720v4xm1261.png?width=310&format=png&auto=webp&s=116f1045eacf3e73ecde3e44868b0867ca0b1231

A GME short squeeze will likely do the same thing, with possibly an even greater climb. However, this is no sure thing. To trigger the squeeze, GME would likely need to demonstrate long term profitability and growth. If MM's continue to believe GME's business model is dead, they will continue to be short as they can wait the 2 years it takes for GME to die.

&#x200B;

I  think that GME is going to use the boost from console revenue to change its business model and help GME adapt to the tech age. With an already decent supply of cash (735 million as of 7/31/20), as well as major investors like Michael Burry (Big Short Guy) and Ryan Cohen (CHWY co-Founder) backing GME, all we need is a change in business model to trigger the squeeze.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Call leaps if you love to gamble your life savings, Shares if you're slightly less of a degenerate than the rest of us

&#x200B;

Edit: As some have also suggested, Ryan Cohen has stated that he is frustrated with GME's Board of Directors. Cohen got around 600 million for his CHWY stake, and clearly is looking to reinvest. He's got 100 million (currently) in GME and if he so wished, he could buy more stock, seeking to kick out some of the board. This would also trigger the squeeze.

How to ride momentum/meme stocks like PLTR/NIO/CRSR (and soon GME) without getting burned.,0.87,"Quick disclaimer, this isn't the only way, and it doesn't work if you buy at the top (obviously).  But I believe this is one of the better methods for maximizing returns while ensuring you don't get screwed when the train stops and the stock dumps 25% in a day.

Essentially what you do, is you buy a few slightly OTM calls dated at least 3-4 weeks out on a stock in meme status.  Sit on them until they go ITM and the value goes up substantially and then sell it, converting it into two new OTM calls for a similar distance out. The other important aspect is that there is leftover money after purchasing the two replacement calls.

&#x200B;

Example, in CRSR I bought a feb call for 4, sold it for 17 and bought two new feb calls for 5 each.  This way, I was able to increase my call position, while recovering my initial investment and locking in 300 dollars in profit. I did this 3 times while it moved from 23 to 53.  Now, I have a much larger position in CRSR than I started with in terms of money/calls, but even if those become worthless, I still made a lot of money on the stock (this was all with slightly otm stocks, but further otm would work as well).  It removes the need to time the top and bottom etc.  As long as you get in early enough to do one flip, you make a profit

&#x200B;

Again, this won't work as well for normal stock movements, but for these massive meme stocks it is a killer strategy.  It is especially important for GME, where it is poised to have the largest short squeeze in history with 125% of float shorted during a time where fomo is probably as high as any time in history.  We could squeeze to 40, or 400....no one really has any clue.  Once the squeeze ends, I would assume the stock price will dump back into the 30s.  Having a way to avoid having to sell at that point is important, and averaging out as it goes up runs the risk of missing out on massive profits. If someone else has a better strat, I'd love to hear it!

&#x200B;

Please ask questions here, I'm happy to help, but I can't handle the number of DMs I've been getting lately, and I PROMISE someone else has the same question you do and would benefit from it being in the thread.

For those asking - current positions (not showing my 1500 shares) and a brief explanation of my short term plan IF GME doesn't start squeezing before ER. This changes to the above strategy as soon as the squeeze kicks off.  [https://imgur.com/6Onvz7I](https://imgur.com/6Onvz7I)",2020-11-28 19:03:57
Missed GME? Don’t Sleep on bby,0.56,"Y’all loving on GME but guess what? 
Bestbuy sells the same stuff, has more supply, and the best part is they know how to play the Wall Street game.

What game is that, you ask?
Here’s a little education for some of you. Ever see companies kill it on earnings and the stonk gets crushed? Lots at play here but one is whisper numbers, the other is guidance. 
Now you may have heard about “kitchen sinking” the quarter or “channel stuffing” to make their numbers. 

But you know what bby did? They killed it on digital. The store is now just a pickup warehouse for delivery drivers to bring shit to your house. And they’re selling 30%+ more than per-pandemic 

But instead of telling you how amazing it is, management gave ZERO guidance. Stock got crushed because people hate uncertainty. 

Think about it. 

Electronics retail is the number ONE card spend category this year according to chase. (Discount warehouse (cost/bj) #2) And it wasn’t just when the pandemic started, it keeps getting better.

How many electronic retailers do you know? Online is a complete seperate category according to VISA merchant codes. That means you can say that BBY controls the TAM, market share for the card spend category. Which means it’s easy to see how things are going. Can’t wait to add in and see the PS5 #s in the next results.

WSB Autist Game Plan Week of November 30 (All-in-One Thread),0.91,"Yoo! I've been browsing these autistic forums and all I see is multi-threads asking the same questions, asking about the same stocks, asking about the next big Yolo.

Here is everything summed up:

\*\*\* Edit \*\*\*

 This week there is a vote on legalizing MaryJ and there are plenty of stocks to choose from:

ACB - we all know the bread and butter of this one.

CGC - expensive out of all of them.

KERN - 

But the one I have my eyes on because its fairly cheap and has an announcement on December second i trading under $1. I think there is a merger that is going to be announced soon. I plan on loading up on BOTH shares and CALLS 1/2$ strike for 2021. I feel that out of all Cannabis stocks this one has the best risk vs reward. Couldnt list the name here bc it is considered a banned ticket, probably because its a penny stock. Do your own DD.

\*\*\*\*\*

PLTR - clearly is this is the TSLA of AI/Data. We will most likely see a small pullback in the coming days as more autists lock in their gains, but this is an opportunity to buy shares at a discount and some cheaper calls far out into 2021 (35C + or higher). You can go ahead and buy some next week.

GME - If you look at GME's performance over last 20 years it has its best/high stock value at console release time. This year wont be any different and the tradition will continue. There is a lot of news about the activist investor / ex Chegg dude trying to restructure the company, huge short interest, cash on hand and early debt redemption. Expect GME to Sky rocket past 20$ before Christmas. TLDR: I bought 75 Jan 20C, will add more next week further out into March+.

SWIR - Sierra Wireless. Definitely a sleeper stock, but recent financial earnings/report have been good. Stock is current trading at a discount and options March and later are pretty cheap. I have 100x March 20C. I expect this one to creep slowly til then and surprise us again in February with Q4 earnings.

TSLA - Papa Musk is Jesus is human form. We should give thanks and praise for all the tendies he has rained unto this world. Until then, stay cautious, tesla is up 50% in like 2 weeks, it will most likely continue its climb up, but right now isnt the time to buy options, wait for a pullback b/c they are too expensive.

MP - plenty of posts about rare earth elements. This is a long term play, I dont expect it to rally as hard as PLTR but its a good side stock to own, potential have some contracts, but they are pricey. I would wait for a retracement first.

CRSR - the make quality gaming accessories. If you missed the run from 15$ to 50$, fear no more, this pullback is a blessing in disguise. I am targetting a pullback to 30$ before loading up on shares and far dated calls. This should be trading and eventually catchup to LOGI.

The Phases of WSB Meme Stocks,0.87,"Buy PLTR shares, hold for at least a month- this is “phase 3” of WSB.  Rational people think it can’t double AGAIN, idiots don’t know when to stop making memes & pushing it with unconditional faith of it hitting 1,000% gains, and retards make the profits. 


See NIO- NIO’s “phase 3” happened around the $26-$35 range.  Solid increase from there.  
See GME- their phase 3 happened around the $11 mark- now up to $16.  


Phase 1: WSB mentions a stock in DD and someone makes a meme about it, but 95% don’t have a clue about the company, but enjoy the hype. 


Phase 2: The stock makes more than 50% gains, and it officially becomes a “meme” stock.  95% of people still don’t know much about it, but Google the ticker.  And watch a few memes. This is where normal people think that there will be a pullback from a 50-100% gain & don’t jump on board.  Retards jump all in and see another 50% gain.  


Phase 3:  contention.  At this point, the stock has at least doubled, probably tripled since its first meme.  There is some profit taking, maybe a pullback (10-25%) but the memes don’t stop.  It get good coverage, it gets bad coverage, but all attention is good.  Can last for 1 day to 2 weeks. Then resumes at least a 30% gain from its last high.  Real wall street is forced to enter real positions in it.  


Phase 4:  Latency. Big money bought in high, refuses to sell and be the bag holder, just waits for the next round of hype to take gains, or ride higher.  (NIO is here, GME is here with the short squeeze).

Given the fact that many of us already burned ourselves with weed stonks, I am not suggesting buying a single stonk option, instead buy the f&@king industry, **$MJ.**  

Almost every single sign is looking bullish on the daily chart. For example, we had: *high volume* breakout, *backtest*, *higher highs-lows*, strong momentum, and we closed on the high on Friday (big green dildo candle). The only risk we have is an unfilled gap between 14.03 and 13.60 and an overbought RSI, which represents some downside risk, but we all know these weed stonks, they don't give a f&@k about RSI. Even if we fill that gap, I will just use the opportunity to buy more calls.

You might wonder, what about the mid and long-term...  Well, I can tell you that the weekly chart is even more bullish. *RSI* still has plenty of room to go and it's *rising* steadily. MACD just broke resistance, *momentum* is extremely strong. If we can get above 15.37 on Monday, we will literally go to the freaking **Moon**! My price target is between 22.82-24.10 (**52% upside potential**). *IV* is still *low*, compared to the last 2 week's high.

"It isnt a meme, its a solid play. Gamestop is a once in a lifetime >3000% return opportunity.",0.94,"**READ THIS RETARDS. SHORT SQUEEZE MEANS MORE RETURNS THAN PLTR, NIO, XPEV, EVERY MEME STOCK COMBINED. GME** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

**Squeeze?**

Its gotten to the point where short interest is over 100%, meaning that more than 100% of the available shares of gamestop have been shorted. How does this happen? Shares can be borrowed, sold, then borrowed from the buyer (making two people technically borrowing the same 1 share). This is insane and has never happened before without causing a short squeeze. (look up volkswagen short squeeze chart to see what it looks like when short interest exceeds 100%).

[https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME\/key-statistics?p=GME](https://preview.redd.it/n8sr8ifnww161.png?width=840&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3f3ef131a7d5bdee19acd4c6bd8196fad9c66aa)

So if gamestop stock goes up, the shorts will have to cover, which is literally impossible since theyve shorted over 100% of shares, so the price will be driven to an absolute retard height. But, whats gonna make gamestop go up? how are the shorts wrong?

**Consoles**

Well, the obvious is console sales, but thats not really it. Yes, the consoles will help, however more importantly there are key indicators that gamestop is not going bankrupt. Recently, they just paid off a metric fuckton of debt *voluntarily* which means they have the cash to do that, aka not bankrupt. People are literally camping out at gamestop for consoles. They will not struggle.

**Cohen**

Also, they are getting the help from ryan cohen, who successfully competed with amazon by launching an online pet store called Chewy, which made him a billionaire. This is good news for gamestop because he will help pivot them from brick and mortar towards a more digital world, which means gamestop now has realistic growth prospects. Also, there is rumors that cohen will announce a tender offer, which would immediately trigger a short squeeze, end of story. Cohen has openly critiqued the BoD about their '20th century mindset' so it is likely he is going to take over soon.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Positioning**

They have also positioned themselves to benefit from non traditional 'brick and mortar' revenue streams. Another thing that gamestop has is online revenue sharing with sony, which means they will be benefiting from digital game sales. They also just announced that they would be selling TVs on their website, showing that they are positioning themselves to compete as an online retailer.

\^Link about TVs.

**The move:**

Buy as many shares as you can and hold. Set a limit sell on all your shares for at least $500, to make sure that you dont miss the squeeze. That alone would be a 3,233% gain.

Important note: This quarters earnings will likely not be a catalyst for a short squeeze. It is likely that there will be a run up and then small dump after. Remember, the shorts are working hard to fuck over longs. Dont be a retard and fall for it. Buy up the dips.

GME Short Squeeze,0.94,TD Ameritrade states that GME has a short interest of 123% of float.

Short squeeze explained for room-temperature IQ,0.96,"Before getting to short squeeze consider this scenario:

Assume you have a long position in Amazon: meaning that you're holding AMZN shares hoping the price will increase in the future and you can make a profit by selling the share. Let's say you bought at $3000 and are hoping to sell at $4000. One morning you wake up and open your Robinhood, and to your dismay, the price of AMZN has fallen to $2000. You freak out and decide to sell quickly to minimize your losses. The highest bid you find is $1998 and you sell at that price. You decreased the price by 2 extra dollars. So by increasing the supply of AMZN, you (and millions of other scared AMZN holders) add to the momentum of the price falling.

A short squeeze is kinda similar but in the opposite direction:

First, let's see how a short position works. You short a stock when you expect its price to fall and you want to profit from the decline. Assume the current price of AAPL is $120 and you expect it to fall to $100. So you go to a bank and say can I borrow 1 share of AAPL in exchange for some interest? They give you the share. You immediately sell it at $120. Later when the price of AAPL falls to $100, you buy 1 AAPL and return it to the bank. You are left with a $20 profit (minus the interest you paid).

Now, what if you have a short position (you borrowed 1 AAPL from the bank when the price was $120 and sold it at $120 immediately) and one day you wake up and see the price is $150. You freak out and decide to close your short position, meaning that you want to buy an AAPL as soon as possible and return it to the bank. The lowest ask price you find is $152. You buy at that price, thereby increasing the price of the stock by 2 more dollars. So you, and many other scared shorters, increase the demand for the share, adding momentum to the rise in price.

What if there are many many short positions, even more than the shares that are available to be sold? Then the many shorters who want to close their short position face a limited number of ask prices. A shorter buys at $151. Then the lowest available ask is $155. That is bought in a second too. Next one is $160.. and so on. Very quickly, the ask prices are going to be eaten out and the price will rise to levels unimaginable before. This is what we call a short squeeze.

What do GME and TUP both have in common? They were going to go bankrupt. **<- This should already convince you to buy GME because of what happened to HTZ in June.**

In June 2020, TUP went $8 and then had a massive -50% pullback (even worse than GME's scary pullback from $15 to $10). It was still 3x off March lows though (sound familiar?????!!!??) so no one was crazy to buy the discounted shares. Then earnings came and blew expectations. GME also expects amazing earnings even though Q3 only goes to October.

Also the short interest is over 100% of the outstanding shares. What does that even mean? It means it's going to be like ACB a few weeks ago **without the risk of holding fucking ACB** (because GME has more cash than debt, and they're paying off their 2021 bonds early already).

Best way to donate to charity: shares not cash!,0.95,"Let’s all make the most of our donations this holiday season. The best way to donate to charity is to send them your best performing shares of stock. That way you don’t pay taxes on any of your gains, and the charity is allowed to sell the stock immediately upon receipt and they don’t pay any taxes either. 

Steps to do this: 
1.	Find the charity’s brokerage account information online or send them a message asking for it. The instructions should include information to perform a Depository Trust Corporation (DTC) transfer 
2.	Call your broker or send them a secure message online to provide them with the DTC instructions, including the ticker symbol, number of shares, and specifically which shares or all shares of a stock holding that you’re looking to donate
3.	Your brokerage will take a few hours up to a few days, and the shares will disappear from your account. The charity will then send you a receipt for the entire value of shares that you sent them, which is tax deductible against the rest of your tendies for the year

Example scenario:
I bought $2k shares of NIO that are up 200%. I donated the $6k of stock to charity, so instead of having to pay taxes on $4k in gains I instead get to deduct the entire $6k on my taxes.

Example of a few DTC instructions for charities:

1.	Food bank example since it’s the holidays/Thanksgiving - Food Bank of Silicon Valley: https://www.shfb.org/give-help/stock-gifts/
2.	The founder of the ice bucket challenge passed away last weekend, so you could also give to ALS research (Lou Gehrig’s disease). This is a disease that has personally impacted my family as well: https://www.als.org/get-involved/ways-give/information-securities-brokers

Caveats: 
1.	Some of the newer, smaller brokers might not be setup to donate shares via DTC, so you’ll have to check with your broker to see if it will work. All of the traditional brokers like eTrade, Fidelity, etc are setup to handle this process
2.	Options are not a good idea to send because of the potential volatility and liquidity that is forced upon the charity. So more liquid, straightforward instruments like regular common stock such has PLTR, NIO, GME is the best way to donate

 PS. The ultimate charitable gift is to buy more shares of PLTR to raise all of WSB out of poverty

Edit: looks like it’s also better if you’ve owned the shares for more than a year. Otherwise you can only deduct your cost basis, but you still get to avoid paying taxes on the gains either way.

The GME Short Squeeze and You; an autists guide to infinite tendies,0.93,"Alright, my beloved retards, listen up.  I know many of you, myself included, are jacking it to the thought of infinite tends from the GME short squeeze.  Problem is, unlike those bosses u/DeepFuckingValue and u/Sir_Jack_A_Lot  many of you retards are poor as shit, and can't afford the shares necessary to become overnight millionaires when this bitch squeezes to infinity.  Yeah, you might make some tendies on the meager 10 shares you bought with the allowance your wife's boyfriend gave you, but who cares if you become a thousandaire, you'll just lose that shit next week.  I'm gonna walk you all through how I am approaching this play.

One word for you autists: FDs

Way OTM weeklies are cheap as shit, every week I have been buying 20 30C for the current week, and the following week.  If you find the right ask, you can get them for $1 each.  If this squeezes, I walk away rich, if it doesn't Im out max $40.

Godspeed, my fellow retards, lets all hop aboard that train to Tendie Town.

TLDR: I buy weekly GME 30C at .01.  Low risk, high reward.

3K --> 2.5M This Yolo Is Free,0.9,"**TLDR:** Donate to St. Jude for extra luck!

Hello WSB,

I want to run through a trade I made for anyone who is confused about the finer points of options trading and the mechanics of an infinite squeeze like the one we saw in TSLA, PLTR, etc.

I encourage anyone who has questions on options to ask in the comments. I see a lot of posts asking about the basics and I want to pay forward all the help I received on reddit.

Part 1: Sell Puts

I sold a GME Put at $30 for 1/15/2021. I got $1680 premium, which I used to fund the rest of my trade. Some may ask why I used this method instead of just using $3000 to buy calls? The answer is that this is to mitigate risk. If GME goes up but does not hit $30 by 1/15/2021, then some of my losses will be mitigated by the increase in the share price.

Part 2: Buy Calls

The next step was to buy 25 GME call options at $30 1/15/2021. This cost $1500, which I sourced from selling my put above. This means I control 2,500 shares of GME above the $30 price point.

Part 3: Forced Buying

Market Makers hedge the options they sell by buying 20% of the shares they have shorted in case the option ends in the money. This means that the MM who sold me those calls bought 500 shares of GME at $13.80 each. I removed $6,500 of shares from the market while only putting $1,500 on the line. As Delta changes, so will the number of shares the MMs are forced to buy as a hedge.

Part 4: The Short Squeeze to Infinity

GME already has 140% of their shares shorted. If MMs must buy shares and hold them until 1/15/2021, that makes it even more difficult for the shorts to cover. Short squeezes are violent and lead to huge increases in price. Overstock grew over 500% and VW briefly became the most valuable company due to similar strategies (Porsche literally bought tons of call options).

It is not impossible to see GME hit $100/share and maybe even $1,000/share (dream with me) since there is no precedent for a company that has this much short interest. If this occurs, then anyone who put 3K down on this trade would cash out with $2.5 Million.

Risk Mitigation

If we get a squeeze: If GME goes over $30, I will make mad money. Many retail investors will become millionaires off of GME.

If GME Stagnates: My cost basis for GME is $4.10 on 1,000 shares. Even if my calls expire worthless, that will only add $1.36/share to my cost basis. As long as we stay over $5.46, I will profit on my position. I plan to sell a few weekly CC to bring my cost basis back down to $4. I have 6 weeks to make back $1500 which means I probably only need to pledge 400 shares at .2 Delta.

If GME Crashes: Even if we crash 50%, I will be making money on the trade. I will sell CCs until my cost basis is $0.

Positions: GME short squeeze to infinity and beyond

Fuck y'all and also I love you (first post),0.95,"(Repost bc automod got mad)

I've been an index man my whole life and done just fine. Picked a couple stocks occasionally but a couple stocks here and there doesn't make you any money so I quit it. Just recently I decided to get back into picking stocks when I started hearing abount Robinhood all the time, going for some growth/all or nothing plays. I can afford to lose a little money and I had low expectations. Well that was also the same time that I started seeing some WSB posts hit the front page. I had no fucking clue what I was laughing at but I was laughing. WSB memes are a gateway drug. 


$2,500 into RH. Bought WRK shares - a cardboard play - everyone is buying online, there is cardboard all over my house and all over my office. They were underperforming peers, got hit with the COVID, and the five of 10 bullets I read in their 10 point or whatever COVID recovery plan seemed good enough. Solid DD. Went in on Mercado Libre. Boring but solid growth. 


After laughing at all you degenerate fucks for a few months I thought to myself, yeah I should buy an option, without doing any research whatsoever. It's one option MIchael, how much could it cost? I purchased my first option. WRK $45C 12/18. Immediately went red. Didn't care. I needed more. First I had to figure out what the fuck an option was and figure out a better strategy. I knew I was ready when I could finally understand the shitposts. God damn I laugh my ass off reading this sub. And not just a little huff through the nose, like actual laughing. Joy I haven't felt in so long. 


I kept losing more on FDs. I didn't even know what an FD was. I just looked that up yesterday, but apparently that's what I was doing and I am the reason it's called an FD. In bed I would just look at who had earnings coming up and buy calls. I was getting fucked by my stupid plays. V, ACTI, ADM (what the fuck is that even? Bunch of soy bean farms. Who cares???), IP (more fucking cardboard). These stocks are not going to move. Just chipping away at my nut but I was expecting to lose so keep going right? Truly retarted. 


Then who came along? NIO. Fucking NIO. Made some money on calls while it was going from 20>30. Made back my losses and then some. Now I'm main lining heroin. Well shit now I know wtf to do right? Just do whatever WSB is doing. Now I'm staring at RH at work for 30 minutes straight thinking about selling one contract and reading posts on the shitter. Made money on CRSR. Made money on SOLO in the brief period it was popular and killed it on that trade. Now PLTR is fucking gold. I've bought and sold FDs. I'm in on a LEAP. I'm in for stock. TO🚀. THE🚀. MOON. 🚀


Now I can't sleep sometimes thinking about my plays that day and the plays I have to monitor the next day. I spend all the god damn zoom meetings I'm in all day staring at tickers. This should not be happening given the amount of money I'm playing with. I've got no positions worth more than a couple hundred bucks. I'm losing sleep over missing out on $20. SO FUCK YOU. BUT ALSO THANKS FOR MAKING ME MONEY, GETTING ME TO LEARN SOME NEW STUFF, FEELING LIKE PART OF THE GANG, AND MOSTLY MAKING ME LAUGH. In 48 days I'm up 75% thanks to WSB (mostly PLTR). I'm going to keep building this nut a bit then YOLO that bitch into a TESLA on whatever meme stock comes next.


There was a post a few weeks ago about people making fancy posts to pump stocks and leaving my retard self holding the bag. Well fuck that. If your DD has bold, paragraphs, some 🚀🚀🚀, and a position then I'm 100% in.

GME $15c 11/27

WSB Calls the Top,0.73,"I think we can all agree the market right now is retarded. Stupid high valuations, SPAC pump and dumps, China-mania, all while the real economy collapses and the country is about to go back into lockdown. Most concerning of all, there have been nothing but gain posts for the last few days, and that screams bear flag. Not even mama Yellen can save this steaming pile of bull-shit. 

Obviously we shouldn't start sucking cock and buying SPY puts while we're still making money. Ride the wave, etc, etc. But unfortunately for the retards, stonks do sometimes go down, and if that happens we are all fucked.

I just read that ""fundamentals"" DD about how 90+% of the market runs through passive loser funds that follow the retail geniuses here at WSB. It seems simple to me that if we are capable of causing the current bull runs on tech, EV, SPACs, whatever, we can also start a bear run. So we just gotta figure out a way to coordinate, if a critical mass of retail sells off and flip bear: the algos follow us, the market collapses, and we all get filthy rich and gay like we always wanted to be. If we don't start the inevitable bear market, then eventually some Wall St Christian Bale fuck will.

For once, the institutions will hold our bags. Even if it fails, at least we'll show them we're gay before our account goes to 0.

Former Chewy CEO tries to push GameStop to become the Amazon of the video-game industry,0.94,"[LINK](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/former-chewy-ceo-ryan-cohen-urges-gamestop-to-become-the-amazon-of-video-games.html)

[Even this former Goldman Sachs PM thinks GME can be supercharged](https://twitter.com/realwillmeade/status/1329804056831922177?s=20) 

TDLR: Ryan Cohen thinks the Gamestop Management are dumb idiots but believes that GME 🚀🚀🚀💸💸💸. He believes the company can be the ultimate destination for gamers, starting with a strong e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming selection, fast shipping and a  high touch experience that excites and delights customers, including content and community. It needs to become the Amazon of gaming, with the added expertise and specialized customer service as a key differentiator.

To do this, Cohen urges the company to cut excessive real estate costs, streamline or sell non-core operations in Europe and Australia and hire the right talent.

Ryan Cohen, the former CEO of Chewy, thinks the maligned video-fame retailer can turn itself around by shifting its focus away from physical stores in favor of a building robust e-commerce platform. Cohen thinks GameStop can use its brand and large customer base to make that transition. He has taken a large stake in the company to try and push it in that direction. He alludes to the fact that one board seat would not be acceptable to him as he wants the company to actually focus on a shift in mindset.

Cohen seems like the type of shareholder who will take it the distance if necessary. In that case, he would have two potential headwinds. 

First, the company recently added four new directors through settlements and nominations by shareholders. That could be enough to placate certain institutional shareholders and ISS if they do not see as dire of a situation as Cohen does in this ultra-fast-moving industry. 

Second, a large part of the shareholder base is comprised of index funds such as BlackRock (12.12%), Vanguard (8.12%) and State Street (4.0%), who are reluctant to back an activist without the cover of an ISS or Glass Lewis recommendation.  However, what is interesting here is there is an unusually high short interest, with approximately 90% of the shares in lending programs, so we don’t really know who has loaned their shares, who can vote them and who can recall them before the meeting.

**Stock Market Value**: $828 million ($12.71 per share)

## Activist: Ryan Cohen

**Percentage Ownership:** 9.98%

**Average Cost:** $5.98

**Activist Commentary:** Cohen is not an activist but an extremely successful entrepreneur. Cohen is the co-founder and former CEO of e-commerce company [Chewy](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=CHWY), which he built up and sold to PetSmart in 2017 for $3.35 billion. Cohen remained CEO following the acquisition until March 2018, and in June 2019, Chewy went public at a valuation of $8.7 billion. This is Cohen’s first 13D filing, but what he lacks in activist experience he makes up for in strategic and operational qualifications in building and running a company in the digital era, giving him a ton of credibility here, even more so than the average activist with respect to certain areas.

## What’s Happening:

On Nov. 16, 2020, Cohen sent a letter to the company’s board, urging them to immediately conduct a strategic review and to provide stockholders with a credible and publicly available roadmap for cost containment, prioritizing profitable retail locations and geographic markets and building the e-commerce ecosystem.

## Behind the Scenes:

Cohen resorted to this public letter because his private attempts were not productive. GameStop sells video games and consoles and has been bearishly compared to Blockbuster. Cohen does not make that direct analogy, but he certainly paints the picture of a company that is on that same path if it does not change.

Sales have declined from $9.5 billion in fiscal year 2011 (before the last console cycle) to $6.4 billion in fiscal year 2019; EBITDA has dropped from $839 million in 2011 to only $111 million in 2019; net income has fallen from $339 million in 2011 to a loss of $470 million in 2019; and in the two most recent quarters alone, the company lost another $277 million. All of this happened while the size of the global gaming market has grown by more than 2.5x since the last console cycle. Cohen sees a company that is stuck in a brick-and-mortar mentality and is unwilling to embrace the digital mindset necessary to grow with gamers.

However, Cohen also sees a company with valuable assets, including a strong brand and large customer base and a path to success and shareholder value. He believes the company can be the ultimate destination for gamers, but that destination must start with a strong e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming selection, fast shipping and a truly high touch experience that excites and delights customers, including content and community. It needs to become the Amazon of gaming, with the added expertise and specialized customer service as a key differentiator.

To do this, Cohen urges the company to cut excessive real estate costs, streamline or sell non-core operations in Europe and Australia and hire the right talent. While Cohen does not specifically target CEO George Sherman, he does note that Sherman has substantial experience working for large brick-and-mortar retailers such as [Advance Auto Parts](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AAP), [Best Buy](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=BBY) and [Target](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TGT) and is committed to a twentieth century focus on physical stores and walk-in sales despite the transition to an always-on digital world.

The company is at an inflection point to make this change. Cohen notes that the company will be able to temporarily mask some of its issues with the new console cycle that will appear to validate its adherence to an outdated business model that is overdependent on brick-and-mortar sales. However, it is also this new console cycle and additional sales that can provide the cash flow to finance this strategy change into the future as the global gaming market is expected to reach $174.9 billion this year and $217.9 billion by 2023. 

Cohen alludes to the fact that one board seat would not be acceptable to him as he wants the company to actually focus on a shift in mindset. This would require at least two — and probably three or more — new directors to the ten-person board, depending on who is replaced. While it looks like Cohen might have an ally on the board in James Symancyk, the CEO of PetSmart while Cohen was running Chewy, Symancyk also has a brick-and-mortar background and might not see it the same way Cohen does.

If this does end up going to a proxy fight, Cohen seems like the type of shareholder who will take it the distance if necessary. In that case, he would have two potential headwinds. First, the company recently added four new directors through settlements and nominations by shareholders. That could be enough to placate certain institutional shareholders and ISS if they do not see as dire of a situation as Cohen does in this ultra-fast-moving industry. Second, a large part of the shareholder base is comprised of index funds such as BlackRock (12.12%), Vanguard (8.12%) and State Street (4.0%), who are reluctant to back an activist without the cover of an ISS or Glass Lewis recommendation.  However, what is interesting here is there is an unusually high short interest, with approximately 90% of the shares in lending programs, so we don’t really know who has loaned their shares, who can vote them and who can recall them before the meeting.

It will be interesting to see if the board will be able to stomach the change necessary to propel GameStop into the 21st century. In the words of former U.S. Army General Eric Shinseki: “If you don’t like change, you’re going to like irrelevance even less.”",2020-11-21 17:05:29
Retard vs Autist,0.94,"Ffs, I can’t believe I’m triggered enough while taking a shit that I needed to stop mid-wipe to write this shit.

I know most of you fucks work at Wendy’s and eat crayons on the daily but for fucks sake, can you fuckers learn the difference between retard and autists??

RETARD - This is 99% of this subreddit. You dumb fucks will throw your life savings into a weekly or 0dte yolo because some dumb fucks DD had all rockets.

Example of a retard is that fucker who dumped his life savings of $250k into GME weeklies, this is a prime example of a Retard.

AUTIST - think about the movie “rain man”. This guy is a fucking autist. He jerks off to his DD and charts, can’t speak in complete sentences but will draw support lines up the ass on a chart. 

This is a fucking autist, think the purple mattress guy, this is a prime example of an Autist.

**The Big Short**

You morons ever see the Big Short? No? Well, let me give you a rundown:

* Autist reads about a million pages of subprime housing loan structures.
* Determines that they are unsustainable and eventually they will go into default.
* Goes to a big bank and purchases CDS, or credit default swap to short the housing market.
* Doesn't buy puts because he isn't a  gaybear, or something.
* Housing market collapses, he makes billions.

So that's basically it. Lazy, poorly explained rundown? Yep. And fuck you, just go watch the movie.

Some of his other notable trades this year are:

* GME,  which he bought back in Q1 2020, and we all know how that shit worked out.
* PDS, which he purchased 4 million shares of at around $0.75 in Q2,  currently trading at $17.85.
* BBBY, 1 million shares bought around  $10.60, currently trading at $20.24
* CPA, flipped 155k shares, bought for around $50.56, currently trading at $75.78.

**Overview**

I  could go on, but my point here is Christian Bale is extremely autistic,  and if you want to be autistic too, go long on one of his recent additions per his latest 13F: LUMN Technologies. Mr. Bale added a  whopping 800k shares in Q3, his 4th largest addition to his portfolio this past quarter.

What is LUMN,  you ask? Well, they are formally Centurylink. And yes, we all know how much of a shit company that was. Hear me out though.

A  lot of companies are going through a bit of a renaissance these days.  COVID is forcing public companies to be smarter, more efficient, and adaptable.

Out are the boring days of boomer telephone lines. Centurylink has transformed themselves into  Lumen Technologies, switching their focus to helping companies enter the  ""4IR"", or Fourth Industrial Revolution. The term makes me gag.

Some of their business exposure includes:

* Adaptive  Network Systems
* Advanced Collaboration Platforms
* AI-Driven Adaptive  Threat Intelligence
* Edge Computing \*Hybrid Cloud Networks

Now I'm no network engineer, but that shit sounds pretty fancy right?

[LUMN](https://www.lumen.com/en-us/home.html)

**Financials:**

* Recently beat their Q3 earnings, with non GAAP EPS at .40, the consensus estimate was .34.
* EBITDA was $2.19B, and the company grew net income to $366M from a year-ago $302M.
* Adjusted net income rose to $430M from $328M last year.
* Generated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of $1.794 billion for the third quarter 2020.
* Revenues fell 3.4% overall to $5.17B, compared to $5.350 billion for the third quarter 2019.

But revenue being down is bad right? Shut the fuck up, LUMN has almost fully recovered their revenue stream from last year, showing solid management in an era of COVID.

I  think this is a positive growth stock moving forward. Additionally,  with further lockdowns on the horizon, we should start to see this equity continue to pick up traction, think NFLX, ZM, etc.

TL;DR: LUMN 1/21 10c, 4/21 12c, 7/21 15c, and 11/21 15c.

EDIT 2 11/21 20:17 CST: Jesus fuck it's Saturday don't you degenerates ever go outside? Well, I guess since this has gained some traction hasn't it boys?

I'll post some additional information tomorrow to address some of the comments and questions below. I can't do that shit tonight, I have a date with u/DonaldJTrumpsGhost's wife.

EDIT 3: FUCK ME 2 HOURS INTO THIS UPDATE AND REDDIT TAKES A SHIT.

I'm not redoing this tonight. Fucking P/E, P/B and P/S ratios, graphs, and everything for you degenerates.

EDIT 4 11/23 20:47: Alright let's try this one again. Below is some additional information to the Bears in the comments who brought up some really great points. Thanks, guys. I'm still right though, and here's why:

First I'm gonna get this out of the way: Everyone who's saying ""bUrRy sUcKs uR cHeRrY pIcKiNg"", ur momma's a hoe.

Ok, I would have thought this goes without saying, but yeah, Burry loses trades. He's not out there batting 100%, or whatever the bullshit way y'all score batting averages in that boring ass sport.

Then again, he definitely is some flavor of Autistic. You ever hang around one? These are the same people who will repeatedly punch themselves in the face because they don't like their new fleece-lined jacket, then play piano sonata no. 14 after hearing Beethoven once. This boy is major leagues, y'all still playing T-Ball.

Anyways let's look at some price ratios:

* PE Ratio: 8.40 compared to industry average 16.46.
* PB Ratio: .80 compared to industry average 2.64.
* PS Ratio: .52 compared to industry average of 2.48.

Don't know what these mean? Well fucking google it. Or youtube it if you have trouble reading. Point here is you're getting a lot of bang for your buck. This is a company that did $21bn in revenue (TTM) and is trading around $10 bucks a share. LUMN is rapidly reducing their debt, recently offering a $750m Private Debt deal to Qwest. Further, they are soon going ex-dividend, which I have seen as a drag on their growth and value. The current dividend yield is about 10%, and getting rid of this will help reduce liability. You got 3 days folks, if you don't own shares by 11/27, no mas dividends. So you know, buy some of this shit.

Subsidiaries & Partnerships:

In a nod to my previous point, I think LUMN was a dying telecom giant who has shifted their focus to all the fancy tech shit people like these days. LUMN owns a lot of companies and has partnered with some household names. They are casting a very wide net, people:

* Level 3 Communications, subsidy.
* Qwest, subsidy.
* Prism TV, subsidy.
* Savvis, subsidy.
* Expanded their partnership with Zoom to integrate video calling capabilities into their platform.
* Increased edge computing exposure by partnering with VMware.
* Gained exposure to virtual learning in public schools by partnering with Sunberry.
* [More](https://www.lumen.com/en-us/partner/strategic-alliance.html)

The list goes on and on.

New Market Enterprises:

The estimated CAGR for the demand for low-latency, modular fiber networks in the Asian market is expected to grow at about 9% over the next 5 years. Guess who has the largest fiber network in the world and is strategically positioned to provide the network backbone to the next generation of internet customers in Asia? Verizon! I'm kidding its LUMN. The Asian market demand is only second to the expected growth in North America.

The aggressive shift to accommodating the rapidly growing tech sector is again the right move by Lumen. Every aspect of their new generation of products is performing well. You might not know it yet, but we are living through a bit of a paradigm shift in the way we communicate and behave. The rapid  growth of the tech industry is a testament to that. I believe that LUMN will act as one of the major suppliers of the growing technological central nervous system. Trust me. At least this isn't a fucking mattress company.

Reminiscences of a Stock Operator: The Evolution of the Average WSB Autist,0.92,"**TLDR:** Alan Greenspan called this book ""a font of investing wisdom"" famous quotes such as ""bulls and bears make money; pigs get slaughtered"" originated from this book.

This book is a true story of how one boy leveraged 100-to-1 and successfully became a millionaire many times over. He buys a yacht, takes lavish vacations, and eventually has enough money to influence market movements.

*• 1890-1910: Livermore was able to make easy money by taking advantage of the bid–ask spread on inactive stocks with leverage of 100-to-1 at bucket shops.*

This is where your average WSB autist starts. Robinhood is essentially the modern day “bucket shop” where people buy and sell stock based on tips they hear as well as crude technical analysis tools. Instead of 100-to-1 leverage, we use options.

*• 1910-1920: Livermore was a stock trader on the New York Stock Exchange, where he went bust over and over again because he used too much leverage.*

Even the great traders of our time lost it all more than once. The most useful lesson is to trim down your leverage and do not “revenge trade”. You need to stay in the right state of mind at all times. The moment you start thinking “I just lost a house payment” it is too late. The money in your account needs to feel like points in a game. It is much better to play the odds and lose on the right play than win money on pure luck.

*• 1920s: Livermore engaged in market manipulation, charging fees of 25% of the market value of the manipulated stock.*

This is where the big dogs are now. Read this section and learn how the market manipulation works. It was the same back then as it is today. Large players will test the market, find resistance, and manipulate the price to sell into retail strength. A lot of posts on this sub are part of pumping and dumping stocks. Remember that you are following the Big Dogs to tendies, and you need to get out before your favorite meme stock leaves you bag-holding.

**My Technical analysis for GameStonk:**  


As you can see in the chart above, this last week we have had 4 green dots. 4 is a lot of green dots for one week, therefore, stock go up. After stock go up 🌈🐻 are fuk, then stock go up more.

Stop thinking they are going bankrupt anytime soon. Just paid $125M of Debt EARLY.

Cohen, who owns almost 10%, just sent a letter to Management via the press calling them out for a dramatic transformation. The letter doesn't say it directly but is implied that if you don't do it I will force it to happen.

Huge Short Interest - I am not calling out a Short Squeeze (although that would be epic). An good piece of news will be the match lighting the fuse.

Fair Value of GME - $20-25/share. Buy shares and watch them double in the next 30 to 90 days. Buy calls on any dip.

GME Bull Case Mid-November 2020,0.93,"This is rather going to be summary of what happened to GME.

1.The smartest autist in the world Dr. Michael Burry is still in the game and in June this year, he voted to back the board.

>""Scion believes CEO George Sherman, appointed by the Board in 2019, is progressing quickly in reshaping GameStop to thrive into and beyond the coming console upgrade cycle. Scion believes that under Sherman, GameStop is approaching its own reboot in a sensible and innovative manner. Scion noted that Sherman, along with CFO Jim Bell, have revamped working capital management for improved efficiency. Most crucially, it appears to Scion that GameStop is now succeeding in transforming vendor partnerships to unlock high-margin revenue streams. Scion believes that this is a direct result of current management's expertise and focus and is a complete gamechanger for GameStop beyond the coming console upgrade. ""

Basically he says new board is adaptable to change and he believes current board can ""reboot"" Gamestop.

2. Ryan Cohen- the guy who beat amazon by selling dog and cat supplies, sent angry letter to Gamestop board to adapt to new era of digital gaming this week. He acknowledges that with the console cycle, Gamestop will have better revenue streams. However, he calls the board members to close the non-profitable stores and adapt to new era of gaming.

He ended the letter with urging board members to quickly announce roadmap for future.

>"" In this spirit, we urge you to quickly provide stockholders with a credible and publicly-available roadmap for cost containment, prioritizing profitable retail locations and geographic markets, and building the e-commerce ecosystem gamers deserve. ""

And Ryan Cohen is a bad motherfucker who turns stone into gold.

>""I look at almost everything that comes to me, but I say no to 99.9% of it. That was true at Chewy too in terms of just programming all of our executives that generally the best answer is no. As Warren Buffet says, the difference between successful and really successful people is really successful people say no all the time.""

This dude saw Gamestop and he saw potential. And we have this guy on our side. His fund owns 9.98% share of Gamestop.

If coherent roadmap is announced soon, it will open big bull case for Gamestop's future. Most likely, they will have official communication on their earnings day when announcing their guidance.

3. Mobile gaming. Ryan Cohen mentions huge mobile gaming market in his letter to Gamestop board.

>""The explosion of mobile. ""

Gamestop is aware of this and they are trying to create community of mobile gamers. Recently, they've partnered with Niantic to attract Pokemon Go players.

4. Partnership with Microsoft . It's a developing story, we do not know full details of the deal. However, it's been rumored that Gamestop will help Microsoft to sell more Microsoft products through their stores (Gamestop has around 5000 stores). And Microsoft will give portion of their digital sales to Gamestop on Xboxes purchased from Gamestop. I think this is honorable attempt to rob some PS5's market share.

[Source: Gamestop partnership with Microsoft](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-multi-year-strategic-partnership-microsoft)

5. Undervalued on paper.

6. Short Squeeze.

"For those who aren't already all in on GME, here's why you should start thinking about picking up a few shares",0.9,"Aside from everything else that's going on with GME right now, there's something interesting about the price movement.

After hours trading closed at $11.52 last night, and as of writing this the price is sitting at $12 in premarket trading with a total volume of **51** (in premarket). Even if we assume that all **51** shares were bought and none of those specific shares were sold, that's an increase of 4.17% from a mere **51** shares bought.

65 day average volume is 11+ million, yesterday's volume was 3+ million, yet the price is refusing to move past $12. That can only be explained by one thing. There is still a ridiculous amount of short selling happening. We need to buy and hold GME and lock up as many shares as possible.

Gme ban bet,0.91,"Alight, I've been losing tons of fake money listening to you bastards. So here's the deal. If by Friday at close gamestop doesn't pass $16.37 ban me. Here's why I'm making the bet. First and most important is I hate you..... well a few of you are cool..... but i hate most of you.. Besides that gamestop ceo George Sherman is biding his time before he either 1) leaves and gets replaced with a new younger ceo (please god... please be rc) or 2 he gets his shit together and realizes that going from advance autoparts to gamestop means brick and mortar may not be the way to go, and that they need to up the e-commerce asap. Im thinking that they partner with uber or lift for a delivery service similar to Uber eats. Now is 2 days really enough time to implement an entire change.... nope.... but announcing these changes is enough to shake a few shorts out and then we wait until earnings and everyone grills them about it. 
Positions since you bastards are thirsty is usually missionary, doggy, and bent over.

1) Employees are clearly overworked. BULLISH. They are printing tendies every day
2) Customers hate Gamestop. BULLISH. I had a biz professor that would say he knew he had a good business when the customers hated him, coz it meant they have no alternatives. For whatever reason the only GME in town for the crack that is PS5 and XBoxX is GME
3) Lots of troubles fulfilling orders coz of Fedex. Bearish unfortunately fuck u fedex for fucking w my tendies. Prolly bullish for fedex tho that they can keep fucking up and people still go them

Ryan Cohen before he sold Chewy for $3 Bilion,0.99,"Cross reference to other posts on Ryan Cohen’s public GME call out with this August 2020 Interview.

Paragraph that caught my eye and confirms my GME bullish bias

Friedman: You were rejected by 100 different investors. What did you learn from the process? What made you keep going when you kept hearing no?

Cohen: For me, each no sounded like they just didn’t understand my vision. It was frustrating at times, but never discouraging. Those “no”s never made me doubt my strategy – it was the opposite. I was motivated by all the rejections and they just got me fired up.

Most investors couldn’t get past two hurdles: competing head-on with Amazon and the pets.com failure during the dot com bubble. But I was convinced being focused on the pet category along with high-touch customer service gave Chewy unique competitive advantages. Pets.com was a good idea but a decade too soon and without sufficient scale to cover their costs. These two hurdles didn’t scare me. I never considered changing my business plan. One highly respected venture capitalist told me he would be more interested if we were selling live pets over the internet rather than pet supplies. Like most investors, he believed running into Amazon’s teeth was suicidal.

I understood that thinking big was likely going to be misunderstood along the way. I’m contrarian by nature, so being misunderstood often validates what I’m doing. It wasn’t until Chewy boxes were on doorsteps across the country that the bulk of investors started to recognize our formula.

Meme! Stocks! Update!,0.9,"TLDR: [Don’t let your memes be dreams](https://twitter.com/litcapital/status/1268987718098391041).

GameStop: Still waiting on a catalyst, but [IV is surging](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/implied-volatility-surging-gamestop-gme-133901115.html). When GME first started making its rounds, every post had a target date of January. This target is still good as we will see Black Friday sales as well as GME earnings and Christmas sales as well. There is bound to be a catalyst. Check out options activity for clues. A lot of deep ITM puts – someone is accumulating GME shares.

EV Gang: Looks like a great run, but I saw multiple WSB commenters arguing that NIO stock was fairly valued because they would be more productive than Tesla in 2032. If you are pricing to perfection for the next 12 years to justify today’s price, then it may be a good idea to take profits.

Vale: Dead meme – last post mentioning this company. However, if WSB is so confident on EVs, it may be better to sell shovels during a gold rush.

Palantir: Wow! Amazing price action! Great numbers on their recent earnings report and institutions are waking up. I don’t see any direct catalysts through December, but we may see sustained demand since large institutions had to compete with a direct listing rather than a traditional IPO. (Soros is in it to win it!)

PG&E: yes, many have all been burned on this one! However, strong buying has commenced, and it looks like we are seeing a run up. A president Biden would bail out California and PG&E.

Clang gang: Gonna be a while on this one. Markets are still discounting current prices on future earnings for gold and silver miners. We are going to see a huge increase, but the powers that be are working overtime to keep this down. I am well over 50% return on my GDX, GDXJ, and AG holdings due to CCs. Get paid to wait!

Tanker Gang: You held through the darkest night. Now is when demand may finally recover. We are looking really good on STNG, DHT and EURN. Remember that a supercycle works on a multi-year time horizon. I will bet that STNG hits $12 by early next year just because their CEO is a madlad who probably doesn’t want his options to expire worthless.

Vix: UVXY is cheap, buy shares and sell CCs in the event that a correction takes a bite out of your meme stocks!!!

Gay Bear Gang: FAANGT stocks were the market leaders through the Covid recovery. It has been a while since these stocks hit their high and it looks like they are stumbling. These are early signs of a faltering bull market.

The Market Wizards: Beat the Market with These 9 Weird Tricks!,0.63,"The following is an excerpt from [The Market Wizards](http://optionboost.com/Market_Wizards.pdf):

There is no holy grail to trading success. The methodologies employed by the ""market wizards"" cover the entire spectrum from purely technical to purely fundamental—and everything in between. The length of time they typically hold a trade ranges from minutes to years. Although the styles of the traders are very different, many common denominators were evident: 

1. All those interviewed had a driving desire to become successful traders—in many cases, overcoming significant obstacles to reach their goal. 

2. All reflected confidence that they could continue to win over the long run. Almost invariably, they considered their own trading as the best and safest investment for their money. 

3. Each trader had found a methodology that worked for him and remained true to that approach. It is significant that discipline was the word most frequently mentioned. 

4. The top traders take their trading very seriously; most devote a substantial amount of their waking hours to market analysis and trading strategy. 

5. Rigid risk control is one of the key elements in the trading strategy of virtually all those interviewed. 

6. In a variety of ways, many of the traders stressed the importance of having the patience to wait for the right trading opportunity to present itself. 

7. The importance of acting independent of the crowd was a frequently emphasized point. 

8. All the top traders understand that losing is part of the game. 

9. They all love what they are doing.

TLDR: [The Market Wizards](http://optionboost.com/Market_Wizards.pdf) is a great read.

"[CRSR] Corsair $40c May 21, 2021 Exp",0.97,"Listen up you degenerates.

If you’ve been pouting all month because you missed out on election week rally, post-Pfizer Dow rally (because you were a pussy who held cash), NIO 🚀, or you were simply 🌈 🐻, then I have the play for the next stock to fawn over.

**What is Corsair Gaming (CRSR)**

Even though this company started trading publicly only a month~ or so, this is a legit company that already pulls in billion dollars in revenue. Company’s products are beloved by all the losers in your life (i.e. your loser childhood friend who works at McDonald’s and spends all their paycheck towards RH YOLO trades, weed, and video games).

This is the number one seller of high-performance computer memory, cases, power supplies, coolers and gaming keyboards as well as #2 in performance controllers and streaming gear. Per Andy Paul (CEO) in their most recent earnings call, he reported that most of their product lines maintain a top 3 US market share positions, with several number one positions according to data from NPD group.


**So what? Why should I care?**

Listen you retard. When there’s unexpected nudity during that HBO show that you watch on Sunday night, you say thank you. You don’t stop and ask, “Man, I thought this show was rated PG. Why is there nudity?” Similarly, when someone tells you about a promising stock that is going to double, triple, and quadruple from the current price point, you fucking listen and continue to read the wisdom documented in this long ass fucking post.

Corsair generates their revenue from two segments.

Segment 1: Gamer/Creator Peripherals.

For you retards who can’t understand big words like peripherals, this segment includes gaming keyboards, mice, controllers, headsets and other streaming equipment such as capture cards and microphones. And I am not talking about $10 mice or $20 keyboards that your broke ass buys at Staples. These are high margin, high end, top of the line gaming/computer peripherals used by those talent-less hacks streaming live on Twitch, YouTube, OnlyFans, etc for “donations”. Today, 71% of millennial gamers in the US watch gaming video content on streaming platforms for an average of almost 6 hours per week. There are over 6 million committed streamers in the world today who viewed over 12 billion streaming hours in 2019 alone.

The revenue in this segment spiked 129% YOY in the most recent quarter to $161.1 million. It made up for 35% of CRSR’s total revenue. This is high fucking margin business, which means Corsair is a winner that rips off those losers mentioned above. Their gross margin was 37.1% in the most recent quarter.

You know why gross margin is important? Because it measures how badly a company can rip off their customer base. You ever see Estée Lauder stock? That stock simply goes up. Jim Cramer talks about that company’s CEO Fabrizio Freda, aka Pringles Man (from his P&G days), aka Febreze (his name sounds like it), all the time. Why? Because that company’s gross margin is somewhere around 50-60%. They sell a $400 candle under Jo Malone brand. What kind of sucker pays $400 for a fucking candle? I have no idea, but you get my point.

Segment 2: Gaming Components and Systems.

This segment includes sales of equipment such as computer cases, RAM, cooling solutions, power supply units and pre-built gaming PCs. You know those losers with a big ass gaming desktop PCs with 🌈 🐻 LED lights around the case? Those 🤡 s spend shit load of money on these gaming systems because it makes them feel important when they play video games with other losers. The gross margin for this segment is 28%. Not too shabby.

In the most recent quarter filing, their total revenue increased 60.7% YOY to $457.1 million and the gross margin jumped significantly. Adjusted operating income increased 194% to $61.4 mil.

**Ok. So they rocked this quarter. But what about their future? What is their outlook?**

Well you ungrateful greedy f*ck, CRSR is well positioned to benefit from long term growth trends in the gaming hardware market, making it an ideal play for retards like you who can only ask questions like, “PS5 or the new XBOX? SNE or MSFT?”. No you retard. Those stocks are not gaming pure plays, and they are not fucking cheap. Your broke ass can’t afford them. 

CRSR can rely on the gamer and creator peripherals business to drive sustained growth in the future. Why? Because of the fast growing e-sports market. According to some smart ass industry experts, they estimate that the global e-sports market could clock a compound annual growth rate of over 24% thru 2027. That means, the demand for video game streaming equipment and other peripherals is expected to increase in the coming years, adding $2.8 billion worth of incremental revenue over the next four years in this market alone.

CRSR reportedly has 18.3% of the peripherals market today and controls 41.9% of the PC components market. The entire PC gaming hardware market is expected to add $3.6 billion in incremental revenue this year, thanks to all the losers playing games at home due to COVID. The total market size for PC gaming hardware market today is $40 billion, of which 83% was spending from competitive and committed gamers. These are true retards who will spend between $1,000 to over $1,800 on gaming hardware and accessories. 

**But the stock ran up quite a bit. Should I wait till it drops?**

The stock is still cheap. Their POS (Price to Sales) ratio is 1.91. In comparison, Logitech’s POS is at 4.3. Additionally, CRSR is currently priced at 80x trailing earnings and has a forward P/E ratio of 26. Both are favorable compared to their peers.

Because of COVID, upcoming holidays and other factors/trends that are favorable to Corsair (i.e. anticipated next generation gaming hardware/GPU to be launched by NVDA and AMD), CRSR is expected to generate full year revenue of $1.6 billion this year (which is 45% increase YOY)

- Second Wave COVID: Will force consumers to stay at home and people will need other activities apart from binging Netflix.

- Holiday Retail Sales Outlook is still positive. Gaming products will be boosted by Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Christmas shopping.

- People are upgrading their home PCs. As more people stay at home or work from home, more attention is being paid to the home PC and people are spending $ on upgrades.

They focus heavily on the higher end of the market, with product focus on performance and innovation. With gaming growing rapidly and big money flowing into this market, demand for performance is increasing. Why? Because when you suck at video game, it’s never your fault. It’s the fault of your gaming gear. So they will go out and spend more money on better shit. CRSR’s products meet the expectation of what the gamers want (i.e. speed, precision, reliability, great processing power, etc)

Although the competitive and committed gamers accounted for 83% of the $40 billion spend in the global market for PC and streaming gears in 2019, that only accounts for 18% of the worldwide total of 524 million PC gamers in 2019 with the remaining being casual gamers, who do not often rely on specialized high end gears yet. (Translation,there is untapped market of 82% among the 524 million PC gamers who have yet discovered the beauty of high end gaming stuff)

If the average spend of this group of gamers were to significantly move up going forward, then the market will also grow by multiples (for high end gaming stuff). 

This stock is currently undervalued compared to its peers like Logitech and Razor. Not only that, the current P/E ratio of CRSR is roughly 3% below the overall P/E of NASDAQ. Additionally, looking at POS (Price to Sales) and MCS (Market Cap to Sales), CRSR is cheap by discount of 57% and 45% respectively to the NASDAQ. Sales are expected to grow next year by more than 30%.

**Risks**

F*ck risks. F*ck that mindset. This company is already profitable and prints money. If you retards can blindly throw money at losers like GME and NKLA, you can throw money at a company with actual sales, actual products and actual profits.

**Price Target**

$40+ per share by May 2021. You can play the call option or you can just buy the stock.
Either way, it will get to $40 range and above once this stock’s valuation catches up with the rest of the market. By end of 2021, I expect this stock to be $70-80. Oh, and for you retards who are risk averse, this stock is considered “Stay at Home” stocks. It will moon during the pandemic, and it will moon after the pandemic.",2020-11-13 05:53:47

Now that I have $3.36 to invest, I figured I would buy Sundial. I can't afford Aurora Puts or Canopy Calls, and Slang doesn't trade on RH. If everything goes my way I will have enough money for a preroll in 2024 when it is hopefully legalized in Texas. 

&#x200B;

And yes it was $100, but longterm even more \~ $ 7k across everything, 

Ferrari tires are \~1.75 each so the math from the TLDR checks out. See below for the rest:

I started swing trading Aston Martin on TD  for $0.05-0.10  in the June when it was playing with $1 (it's down to $0.80 today) 

I thought "" wow this is easy"" until they hit me with the fees a month down the road. 

So I got a Robinhood, too and once I lost most of my money, a WeBull. That comes later. 

I started making money swing/daytrading shares, and then ""taught myself"" options.

* Panic Selling GME calls, they were profitable within 2 days and I had months,                                       
bought and sold puts and blew the remainder of the account... GUH
* Did not Buy NKLA as VTIQ, thinking it was a scam and worthless compared to Tesla                               
While this is true everywhere except the NKLA subreddit, it went to $90 and I missed it... GUH

I won't have much to say until I get off unemployment, I guess I could paper trade but that seems way less fun than the past few months. Here's some nostalgia:

Anyways seems like enough for now. I guess I can get up from my chair at the Wendy's I am currently sitting in and turn in my application. I just feel like I'm not worth the job so I might just head to the dumpster instead.

If a Market Maker scanner sees this, forward the following to Jamie Dimon:

""Dear Jamie, Please Venmo me $10,000 I promise to let it get spoofed out of me by your metals desk trading GLD options and NAK. Hope the family is well, Happy Holidays."" ###

&#x200B;

I will end with a prayer.

Dear Jerome, 

I am sorry for my sins. If I am given another chance at tendies I will approach them as a grateful bull. Buying stocks is better than selling them, that's why we have covered calls, overnight pullbacks for entries, overnight gaps for gains, and our patron saint: margin. Obviously stocks should go up, we have the technology to make them go whenever we want, I don't know why I didn't listen to the blatantly obvious signs of a Bull Market or the wise words of the oracle himself .

1) volunteer at my local gamestop. I’m pretty sure the motivation of either being absolutely broke or having life changing money will motivate me to work as hard as a good 3 or 4 underpaid kids

2) advertising, i’m already starting low key with some Michael Burry style DD on tik tok, asking questions about where people would likely shop for games. I’m planting the seed and trying to figure out how to water it, i also downloaded and highly rated gamestop’s app on the app store (i gave full disclosure that i was levered to my eyeballs and absolutely fucked if gamestop share price didn’t double in 2 months, anyways apple never approved my review)

Did GME write crazy ITM puts because they're undervalued, bullish af, and increasing value for all of us long with them?

At first I thought the theory was stupid because the puts were written so deep ITM that there would be far too much risk. Then I noticed an interesting trend on the [11/20 20p](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME%7C20201120%7C20.00P/price-history/historical) which are obviously even deeper ITM.

GME - Let the games begin,0.93,"I just wanna start off by saying, it's no coincidence that this news came yesterday - on CONSOLE RELEASE DAY which **also** happens to be the day when short interest data was to be released. That's what you call execution **chef kiss*.*

Yes, this is only the beginning. The console cycle has just begun and GameStop is the largest retailer of games and consoles in the world, with over **5,500** stores worldwide in 14 countries [1]. This cycle will last (at least 5) years, as all have previously. GME's pivot to e-commerce combined with an entry into the gaming equipment market will be the defining edge for GameStop.

GameStop. The only place you *know* will have whatever gaming-related item you want - with same day delivery in many locations. This is where GameStop is headed. 

Most of you will already have heard the news from GameStop regarding ""Voluntary Early Redemption of Senior Notes"" [2]. For anyone that's unsure, this means that they are repaying debts equivalent to $125mn *voluntarily*; as in they are not *required* to pay that debt back right now. 

We already knew that GameStop reported $700mn+ in cash so this reaffirms that GameStop are able to use the cash for deleveraging as opposed to them being *in a tight spot for cash*, so to speak, during the pandemic. This is great news for a brick-and-mortar store (since half of Reddit wants to keep calling it that) considering the sheer number of funds that are about to flow through GameStop (as they have been on pre-orders and will continue for YEARS). I'm no longer concerned about the next earnings as the cost-cutting by Management has been ridiculous. GameStop WILL beat ER expectations.

The news of a vaccine does not negatively impact GameStop or GME stock, in my opinion. People aren't going to game any less than they were before lockdowns, simply because lockdowns are (allegedly) going to go away soon. Before covid was a thing, the gaming industry was continuing to explode as it as has been year on year. It's not gonna slow down any time soon. Not now. Not when Sony and Microsoft just blessed us with the next generation of gaming consoles.

Also, short interest is down this time around but only by around 4 million shares. We still have about 66 million shares short. Any more big news and we'll be off 🚀🌚.

To recap: 

-Burry/Cohen still **in**


-u/DeepFuckingValue still *IN* (big respects for 💎 hands)


-institutions increasing their stakes in GME [3]


-short interest still over 100% (insane, in itself. However, combined with the increase in institutional ownership, this adds to the ""battle for GME"" lore. Meme status increased⬆️)


-new console cycle JUST started and it's going to last YEARS
(GameStop bout to make bank and keep making bank)


-debts have been reduced by $125mn


-costs being reassessed and cut down regularly

-stores with negative cash flow being shut down continually


-MSFT deal


-yada yada yada

"GME short squeeze won't happen anytime soon and it probably won't be as big as you think, stop buying weeklies and get shares instead",0.91,"GME has a short % of float of 160.45% as of Oct 30. Some of you retards are probably having wet dreams thinking about the short squeeze but let me tell you why it won't happen anytime soon.

Check out  [https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts](https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts) , clear your cookies if you want to re-visit the page. Ever since the peak at $15 there's been a huge amount of short selling happening, this combined with the low volume and bad liquidity means shorts can drive the prices down with very little selling and they're able to cover back at low prices to turn a good profit. This all appears to be pretty well coordinated and at times when the cost to borrow becomes high like in October, they are forced to cover but then just restart the short attack again when liquidity dries up and the cost to borrow becomes lower. The cost to borrow has gone from 37% to now just 13.72%  and appears to be trending down further.

I'm willing to venture a guess and say there's probably some hedge fund asshole driving the price down on naked short selling, which could at least partly explain the >100% short % of float .

I'm very bullish on GME and I have 900 shares, selling covered calls close to the money at >100% IV to you retards weekly. I'd like to thank you for your tendies but if you really want the stock to squeeze, stop buying weeklies, and start getting shares.",2020-11-11 03:22:45

BUY CNK! You haven't missed the boat. (Squeeze inbound!),0.82,"tl;dr: buy shares of CNK!  

&#x200B;

Listen you fucks... I'm a little salty that I spent a ton of time researching and typing a full-up DD for CNK last Thursday and Friday.  I got lazy and left early friday, figuring I'd finish today... Now it's irrelevant.  Even you, yeah you, with the smooth brain, can see that CNK is up bigly today.  **But you have not missed the boat yet!**

I dare say the words short squeeze, but hear me out.  I know everyone is sick of hearing it after the GME thing still hasn't panned out, but CNK is 30% shorted, and most of them have gotten in since the BK news from AMC.  **CNK IS NOT AMC**.  Thats I'll I need to say about that.  Back to the numbers:

Short interest has been increasing since the end of April, when there was roughly 11m shorted.  We've now increased to 30M shares short, as of last month.  Using data from marketbea, the average share price shorted at from Apr until now is 12.40--that's completely unweighted for number of shares shorted, just a pure average for a stake in the ground.  More importantly, from 15 September to 15 October, shares shorted went from 23-29 M, at a weighted average of $8.87 per share.  [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/CNK/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/CNK/short-interest/)

Cool.  Now lets look at the shareholders.  Institutional investors own 85% of the float, according to CNN money.  **The top 10 institutional owners** and fund managers own 67% of the company (79M shares), or --get this-- **89.3% of the float!** 

With 30 M shares (33% of the float) shorted as of last count, this has the potential to really explode.  

Pos: long 2k shares.  Had planned on jumping in on some sweet Mar '21 calls, but missed the boat.  Buy shares, ride it up to 20+ and then do what you wish.  CNK will be back to 30+ by EOY 21 as long as the divvy is reinstated.",2020-11-09 16:22:20

Bottom line is don't bet against eCommerce, China or the Kardashians/Jenners, 95 times out of 100 you'd lose money.

**Honorable Mention: Former Rep. Barbara Comstock (VA-10)**

Comstock lost her 2018 re-election bid and I don't necessarily think she is a WSBer (she doesn't trade nearly as many meme stocks as the other guys on this list) but I do blame her for turning off the ATM that was 2016-2018 $MU.

She bought \~$75,000 worth of Micron Technology stock on 6/25/18, just days before the first stretch in years when the stock wasn't literally printing money. MU lost half its value in the next 6 months, and still hasn't recovered to the price she purchased it at.

**#5. Rep. Alan Lowenthal (CA-47)**

***Favorite meme stocks: SPCE, GLD***

Lowenthal is actually one of the more successful traders on this list, having gotten in to $GLD in September of 2019. He also timed his exit from $SPCE pretty well, selling about half of his position right at the mid-February peak.

If I had to guess, I'd say Lowenthal just lurks the sub looking for opportunities to inverse WSB.

---

**#4. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (NJ-5)**

***Favorite meme stocks: SNAP, TSLA, GE, NVDA, LULU, AMD***

The Josh Gottheimer story is a story of perseverance and diamond hands. I'm pretty sure this guy read some DD on here that said SNAP was going to moon after its IPO, because he bought into the stock just days after it went public. He caught the falling knife right on its tip as his position lost 75% of its value over the next couple years. A lesser man would have cut the loss, but Gottheimer just kept buying up more $SNAP even as it was losing him money. Those of you who have an eye on the markets (perhaps a minority) will know that his grit and determination was rewarded handsomely in the last couple months.

---

**#3. Sen. Pat Roberts (Kansas)**

***Favorite meme stocks: TSLA, GLD, BYND, NVDA, GE***

Pat Roberts is another guy that I think just comes here to inverse the sub. Roberts made an impeccably well-timed TSLA play a few months ago when he bought in on August 3rd, just a few days before the August run-up began and then sold on September 1st, just before the early September drop.

Insider trading or inversing WSB? You decide.

WSB must be big in Kansas, because the next guy up is the fellow who was just elected to fill the vacancy being left by Roberts upcoming departure from the senate.

---

**#2. Rep. Roger Marshall (KS-1)**

***Favorite meme stocks: JNUG, TSLA, SNAP, MU, ROKU, AMD, NVDA, LULU***

Marshall got a big promotion to the Senate a few days ago, and if that didn't work out he probably would have switched to day-trading full time. He was already day-trading JNUG within a few months of entering office, buying and then selling thousands of dollars worth of the stock between market open and close.

What Marshall really lacks is patience, as he recently entered then prematurely exited a position in ROKU in mid-September, missing out on big gains in the weeks to follow.

**#1 Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (Rhode Island)**

***Favorite meme stocks: GME, TSLA, GE, NVDA***

The story of Sheldon Whitehouse is not a happy story, but it's a story that might be told of many a member of this community. He had the right ideas, but just did not have strong enough hands to see them through.

On July 28, 2017, Whitehouse entered a position in $TSLA. Seeing a modest 3% gain through the month of August, he doubled down on his position on August 24th, 2017.

Although he soon began to lose money as $TSLA sank, in Elon he still trusted, and he bought more $TSLA yet again in December of 2018.

Sadly for Whitehouse, we now reach the heartbreaking part of the story. Seeing a 30% loss on the investments into TSLA he'd been making over the last 2 years, Whitehouse lost faith and sold the entirety of the position on August 27th, 2019.

After holding TSLA for over 2 years at a loss, he sold within weeks of what would become a yearlong, nearly 1000% run-up.",2020-11-07 14:47:21

Proposition 22 in California will set a precedent for whether or not Uber will be able to continue to operate as it has before, and despite the ridesharing and food delivery industry spending 200 million on ads supporting the measure, it only has a slight lead with many still undecided. As such, I have targeted Uber for a double catalyst play.  


I will be buying puts on Uber, but here are reasons why you should, and reasons that you shouldn't:  


Reasons NOT to buy puts:  

\-Prop 22 passes.  

\-Good earnings (date 11/05).

\-Market starts to recover election week.  


Reasons that you SHOULD buy puts:  

\-Prop 22 fails.  

\-Bad earnings.

\-Market continues down.

&#x200B;

First factor: Prop 22 passes or fails. While the race is tight, Prop 22 has a good chance of going either way. There has been a lot of controversy around this proposition, with Uber and others pressuring drivers to vote yes on the measure, spending over 200 million in advertising, and paying several research centers to review the proposition (also contributing 2 million to the California Republican Party). Proponents of the bill believe that drivers want to keep their freedom as independent contractors, with the ability to choose when and where they will work. Drivers will also receive health care and other benefits. However, opponents of the bill point to Uber and other companies' constant rate decreases. They also argue that the health care plan chosen by Uber is one of the most expensive and only applies to those who work over 30 hours a week. Furthermore, allowing Prop 22 to pass would set a precedent for other states and allow companies to reclassify workers as independent contractors, no longer guaranteeing them any health care or unemployment benefits.   


I believe Prop 22 will fail for the following reasons: California is a largely Democratic state. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have publicly expressed opposition to the bill, while Republicans support it. Even with all the advertising, the fact that the voting on this proposition is so close means that enough Californians are opposed to it to cause it to fail. It will be very close, however, with all of the money Uber and others have put into the campaign.   


Second factor: Earnings  


Uber has historically never had ""good"" earnings. It has only lost less than analysts expected, never once going above its IPO price even as driver's cut of their ride fares has consistently decreased, and the number of drivers has increased. I believe that Uber will again fail to turn a profit this quarter, especially with the many lawsuits and the Prop 22 campaign they are now facing. 

&#x200B;

Third factor: The overall market

The market downtrending may accelerate any negative news about Uber. COVID cases rising, news of lockdown, a contested election, or Joe Biden winning the election will all cause the market to tank as they try to figure out what they should expect for the next few months.  


In terms of the election, there is only one outcome which will cause the market to rise: Trump winning, with a majority Republican senate. However, the other outcomes, such as Biden winning, or either party winning but with a Senate against them, would cause the market to fall. 

&#x200B;

Prop 22 failing: 50/50  


Bad earnings report: Very likely

Overall market tanking: Very likely

Puts on Uber.   


GME update: Still in but have reduced my position a bit to throw some into UBER puts. All the factors I mentioned in my first DD are still in play, but the overall market tank, combined with the price inflating a lot over the past months and lack of new news caused the price to fall a bit. Still way above $4 where we started. The console cycle starting should cause price to rise by January.",2020-11-01 00:02:07

"Gamestop, technical DD on how this gaming cycle will blow the previous highs out of the water. The second coming of physical vs digital games.",0.85,"I’m sure everyone read enough of how management is going to turn this around but no one spoke about how the gaming console itself is going to benefit Gamestop since they deal with a lot of physical/disc sales/resale.

I just want to talk about the second coming of Tesla that is Gamestop. I talk mostly about how Gamestop will boom with rise in physical game vs digital. What I talking about? I’m talking about the coming of 4k gaming. While you bitches are trying to just play the short squeeze for a price target of 50$ you are completely missing the bigger picture. We are going to easily go above the company’s all time record high made back in 2008 62.11$ without the squeeze when all said is done. (Don't forget our buddy Michael Burry managed to kill 1/3 of the outstanding shares through last years buyback) Edit: Also there's still another 101M in buy backs still not executed. 

Back in 2012, anyone who was a gamer can tell you how big of a POS the console launches were because of one reason. The hardware were absolute trash, it was using AMD’s CPU/GPU and everyone complained because you’re paying a premium for low tier outdated PC parts. Intel cpu was what people wanted fitted with Nvidia graphic cards. You have 12 year olds rocking PCMR (PC MasterRace) logo everywhere making fun of peasants potato console. Look at AMD in 2012, it was trading at 2$. Company probably had Donald Trump at the helm making the calls running the company into the ground like his Casinos.

Anyways, this time is fucken different and even better than it was back in 2008. In 2008, cpu/gpu improvements were still doing fucken leaps and bounds year after year. The game consoles were outdated within a year or 2. In 2020, CPU/GPU improvements slowed to an absolute crawl and parts cost a fucken arm and a leg. Moores law hit a wall and getting 2x performance over last year was no longer possible and the cost for parts kept going up. You want the latest and greatest? That’ll cost you 2000$+ for PC gaming, hell no one is going to have that kind of money especially with this recession.

Now here comes PS5 and Xbox Series X, giving you the latest top of the fucken line gaming hardware for 600$. M$ and Sony is losing money on this like back in 2008, you will hear every fucken reviewer praise this and tell you go out and buy it. Everyone and their mom’s going to go buy new gaming console for their kids so they can fuck off while they have sex with her boyfriend in the other room.

How does any of this benefit Gamestop? Well with now the latest and greatest gaming console and top of the line hardware we will see an actual push for 4k gaming.

4k gaming to say the least is very hardware intensive and also takes up a fuck ton of storage space. What takes up a lot of storage space? 4k fucken texture packs for 4k gaming alone takes up +20gb of space. Yes that fucken storage space is going to be huge. The last generation we never had any real push for 4k gaming, fucken hell they mostly ran below 1080p to even be remotely playable at 30 FPS. You think people are going download entire games when it takes days or weeks to download with their dial up connections. No they will buy physical discs 9/10 times.

Moreover anyone who plays games on console will tell you 99% that they prefer disc over digital downloads because it cost the same as digital.

Lastly, we all know that with the new console release there is actually a lack of new games but that matters not. All games are backwards compatible, so where does Gamestop benefit from this? Well they are only the biggest used game reseller around the block. When people go to buy the new console they are going to go to Gamestop over Amazon or Bestbuy and buy used game to play when everyone goes back into lockdown. Everyone who was planning on spending 3000 on trips oversea will be buying games instead.

&#x200B;

Anyone who says they are going to go like Blockbuster and point to the last 2 quarters is trying to shill you. Everyone knew that a new super gaming console cycle was coming, they were holding off on their purchases and been saving their pennies for this. The next quarter for Gamestop is going to be its biggest.

TL;DR

Big push for 4k gaming will result in large files downloads incentivizing people to choose physical discs over digital.

Positions. Shares and even more shares for now. After election IV Armageddon 01/15/21 30C or further out.

TL;DR x2 Also for everyone saying that Gamestop will go out of business. Here’s just a quick discussion on just simply why it makes sense for Microsoft/Sony to exist. [https://youtu.be/8gEfHD\_y7Pc?t=938](https://youtu.be/8gEfHD_y7Pc?t=938)

Gamestop will be their showroom, so it makes sense for Gamestop to thrive and not run them out of business. Amazon/Bestbuy/Walmart sure as hell aren’t going to advertise games for them since they aren’t a gaming retail store primarily.

PS. Bunch of hedge funds trolling GME to scare you out of positions so they can cover their shorts.

Edit. PPS. This is a post to argue against how people think games will go full digital and leave Gamestop to go bankrupt. The infrastructure isn't here as telecom companies still cockblock people into internet caps/speeds and most of the time simply won't expand their network because they don't make money doing it.",2020-10-30 23:52:59

Here's a play (GME Shitpost),0.85,"Alright autists,

If you really want to put the hurt on the MMs and HFs you gotta protect yourself. If you think GME is a meme stock gtfo of this post.

The big boys have an insane amount of short interest and an insane amount of capital and will bend the SP whatever way they want since it's a small cap. Literally half a 1MM of buying will light this thing up $2 a share. If you're retail you need to protect yourself.

(Btw the reason they can't bend it back to $4 is because they're running out of shares to short)

 If the stock price goes down to where it was before September they all cover no problem WSB loses no squeeze boo hoo your wife's boyfriend moves in for a month. So it begs the question, how do I keep my tendies when the big boys keep selling? Retail paper hands are gonna fuck on this SP every time there's 300k shares sold short every open.

If you look at the charts, occasionally there are days where the shorts buy back en masse. A huge volume spike with a correlating SP upswing of 15+%. On these days lots of people sell off and shares free up. Now how do you add more pain....

If you've been paying attention the squeeze can only happen if enough SHARES are locked up. You can thank Burry and the HF Boyz for the tiny float available, but the retail player needs to tie up SHARES. 

""But I need my tendies, when I see 15+% green I sell!""

Good point, buy low sell high. But maybe you can do better.

The amount of downward force coming from the hedgies shorting is unreal. They will always depress the price to reduce their borrowing fees and eventually buy back the shares. This is a blessing.

 And here's why:

*You can buy OTM puts on days that see 15%+ gains*

By insuring your shares stay valuable after the spike, you pay a premium up front to be *protected* when the big Boyz start shorting again. With the put in place it doesn't matter that the stock is shorted to oblivion because you have locked in your gainz. 

""But what if they don't short more?"" 

Good question retard. The answer is they will pay interest on a higher stock principle. High stock = more bleed.

If you have puts that are 2 weeks out EXP you can wait for the SP to get manhandled back to $10 and exercise. Lock in the gainz from the put and reset your position at a lower cost basis. Now you got your tendies and you still have the same amount of shares. Rinse and repeat until BofA lets you fuck their wife.

This can literally go tits up IF GME goes bankrupt. Now if you can read any kind of financial statement and have any faith in Cohen Burry etc you'll realize it's tough for most businesses with $4 cash/share to hit Ch. 11. But as long as they have shares on the market, this might work.

This is purely a thought experiment and I am not a financial advisor. Do whatever you want with your life man.

**BULL CASE, NO SQUEEZE:**

Video games have multi-generational appeal. The oldest generation being 40-50 year old gen x’ers that have been playing (and developing) video games since Atari 2600 in the 70s, all the way to single-digit age kids coming to video game age every year. Babies being born provides steady supply of new gamers over time  while the older generations continue to play video games and buy games for their kids, and many have the disposable income to afford the good stuff. The total addressable market is growing and still has a couple of decades to reach full generational saturation.
*Courtesy of u/Mr_Saturn_*


If we consider the company's

-cash in hand (i.e. ability to stay afloat) 

-sold out pre-orders on the new consoles

-brand awareness (how many of us bought something from GameStop as a child? I bought a LOT of shit from GameStop as a kid and I want my fucking money back so I'm in as I'm sure a lot of others are in for a similar reason). On a serious note, GameStop is well known in the UK as well as in the US. They no longer operate here, however, you and I can all bet our asses that my fellow countrymen have been and shall continue FOMOing into this on any future news of a turnaround and/or deal and/or large institutional investor joining the fight and/or short squeeze becoming imminent. 

*EDIT:* Also I don't believe the Blockbuster anecdote applies to GME as GameStop is operating in a thriving and evidently growing industry: the gaming industry. Brought to you by the lockdown of 2020-2021(maybe like 2022 at most right??). Blockbuster was struggling in the age of on-demand streaming. If it somehow survived til now, covid would've killed it within weeks if not days of news breaking out. Also Blockbuster no longer offered any cost-advantage to their customer. You could stream for free on pirate sites back then or pay for an emerging premium service called Netflix (who tried to buy Blockbuster but they refused the offer and got rek't shortly after). The cost of said premium service per month would not even exceed the cost of renting a couple of dusty ass DVDs back then. None of these things apply to GameStop. They offer second-hand AND brand new - capturing a wide market (wider now, with the recession and all). They offer a loyalty system which isn't half bad (I'm guessing this will change for the better anyway under new management). They can and do still offer competitive prices on many many items including consoles, games, and all sorts of gaming equipment. They are primed to make a KILLING from this console cycle. Regardless of whatever happens, don't fall for this false narrative.

**GameStop ≠ Blockbuster.**

-possibility of acquisition of GameStop by a large retailer; think Amazon, Costco, or Walmart acquiring a recognised gaming-industry retail company (GME) with a view to becoming the single biggest retailer of games and gaming equipment by incorporating it into their existing logistical systems. I personally think if anyone ever considers this, it'll be Amazon. They're the only ones (I think) who could handle logistics for the massive customer base they will amass following this. Imagine buying a game from GameStop, and it arrives at your door with Prime Delivery. This would obviously be the ""home run"" so to speak. This type of news alone would, without a doubt, cause the single greatest squeeze ever witnessed. **HOWEVER, DISCLAIMER: This one is pure speculation from my side. I haven't seen anything to support or even suggest this, this is purely a hypothetical situation and most likely will never be a serious topic of discussion**

-constant cost cutting by way of closing down locations which aren't making money 

-change of management  

-involvement of Michael Burry (i watched the Big Short and thats all the DD we really need here let's be honest...)

-institutional investors holding a signification amount of shares and not selling even after such ridiculous rallies 

-attempt at pivoting to e-commerce

-Microsoft profit-sharing deal on new console sales. Guaranteed to bring in revenue above and beyond what will be generated purely by GameStop's own trading of items. A deal of this type clearly shows that Microsoft NEED GameStop to keep operating - it *could* also be an indication of future deals been the two companies

-rumoured Sony deal 

-potential for further deal(s) with more big names such as Nintendo 

-increasing retail interest 

-retail investors looking for the next success story 

-premium meme status 

I think the stock price (without any sort of squeeze action) will sit around $30 to $50 by the time earnings from the new consoles come into play. This puts the company at a market cap of around $2bn to $3.5bn, respectively - a fairly reasonable valuation compared to previous gaming cycles and taking all aforementioned factors into consideration (and assuming they all go in favour of GME i.e. no bad news, no scandals, no big investors selling off, smashing earnings reports, securing further deals, etc.).

This valuation MAY be achievable solely based on earnings from new consoles and other products, as well as a successful pivot to e-commerce. However, I personally believe the valuation of $2bn to $3.5bn is contingent on some sort of cataclysmic news (i.e. more deals with the likes of Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo) carrying the price to the $20 to $25 range PRIOR to the console earnings coming into play. If such a catalyst occurs in time, it may provide the stock with a new floor around $20 to $25 (making the valuation sit at around $1.3bn to roughly $1.6bn) as more retail investors start to take notice.

**BULL CASE WITH SQUEEZE:**

Assuming that a short squeeze actually takes place, God only knows where it could end up. I REALLY like that one guy's PT of $500 but that's probably not going to happen. With that being said, I can't even fathom what a short squeeze with 170% short interest could actually do to a stock like this.. Please, someone with ACTUAL knowledge of the market feel free to chime in here. 

So... PT with the turnaround story, securing new deals/partnerships with big companies, increase in retail interest, AND some squeeze action on the side?? $100 to infinity. 


_____


**BEAR CASE:**

The company has been in decline for about 6 years. When we consider WHY the stock is trading so low, one wonders why it would suddenly become worth even $1bn, let alone $2bn to $3.5bn. The rise of e-commerce and now with the ultimate fuck you from the universe (covid) to brick-and-mortar stores.. it's really no wonder why the company is doing so terribly. They may continue to trade at these elevated prices running up-to and through the initial console release period, but it will not last. This is because making a breakout in the e-commerce sector will be nearly impossible because of Amazon (worldwide), eBay (worldwide), GAME (UK/Europe), and large supermarket chains like Tesco (UK), Asda (UK) and Costco (USA/UK) already having a pretty solid grasp on the market in their respective territories.

Additionally, as mentioned above, the bull case is contingent on so many factors that it is more likely to continue declining in the mid to long term rather than trending up by any significant measure. Contrary to what a lot of people are thinking, the bear case is actually supported by the ridiculous short interest. Why would so many people be betting against a stock with such passion (170% shorted ffs) if they didn't absolutely believe that they are right and that GME is done for? At least one really solid catalyst WILL be required to push the stock up significantly. It seems that the Microsoft deal was not a significant enough catalyst make the share price moon. So how far up is another deal REALLY likely to push the share price?

Also, If there is no such catalyst until new console earnings come into play, or if big investors start pulling out at ANY point, the stock MAY still spike as console earnings come into play, however, it most likely will not hold above $25 and will crash hard as fuck when people start taking profits/realise what's about to happen.

Also, why would this console cycle affect GME the same way as previous cycles did? We now have so many options to choose from when it comes to buying ANYTHING let alone games or consoles. Of course, Amazon won't be able to fulfil every single order. GameStop WILL pull in hella revenue as demonstrated by the selling out of BOTH waves of PS5 preorders. However, the effect on the share price will not be the same. We will most likely see some huge spikes leading up to/after earnings, but it will be short-lived as people will see that GameStop is one of MANY retailers offering competitive prices for the same items and as supply and demand meet an equilibrium. 

Also.. what do most people do when they can't find something at their go-to store? Most people I know would look at Amazon or eBay rather than waiting it out. This will pull a lot of revenue away from GameStop as other retailors will fill the gaps and reduce the prospects of revenue growth over time. This, in turn, will make the stock price tumble once again, and probably harder than it ever has because this may be GameStop's last shot at turning it around.

Ultimately, I think if any sort of a bear scenario plays out, we could be looking at 52-week low within the next few weeks (I personally don't hold this opinion as I need to keep believing to remain sane).


_____


I could keep talking in circles about why the stock is/isn't gonna moon and who's gonna get fucked the hardest; bears or bulls, respectively. Every reason FOR either side can be easily followed up with an argument AGAINST it. 

I would personally really like it if someone could pump the stock so hard that shorts start covering, causing a domino effect of shorts covering their positions (and their asses), leading to the ultimate short squeeze so I can finally make a little bit (or a lot) of money. But for all we know, this shit could crash so hard I might never be able to bring myself to trade again.

**TL;DR** high likelihood of *great success*, matched with an equally high chance of complete obliteration.

BULL CASE: $20 to $50 by the time earnings come into play.

BEAR CASE: I'm fucked! Probably about to see 52-week low in a couple weeks, followed by swift tumble to penny-stock territory.

Question! Options play for a major short squeeze... (GME) How does this all shake out?,0.94,"I'm asking this question with GME in mind but it would apply to any short squeeze scenario. Anyone's input who has real experience or knowledge about my retarded questions will be greatly appreciated. Also, I think that a lot of **other tards out there who are stacked with GME calls may want (or need!) some clarity here as well.**  

Obviously, I know buy the fucking stock, which I have. However, I do own call options and am wondering if anyone has any experience with how options contracts play out in a short squeeze scenario. I've never played with options in a really stacked short squeeze set up, so I'm wondering how valuable the options will actually be. 

My concern is that even **if the stock goes through the roof as the gay bears try to cover their furry loose buttholes, will anyone actually be willing to buy these contracts at an insane price knowing that tomorrow the price may very well be back to where it was the day before?** 

* If they won't, then the contract won't really be worth whatever hypothetical price that a normal contract would be in with the same numbers in a different, non short squeeze set up, correct? 
* Or am I wrong? Will they be able/willing to buy at astronomical prices and exercise the contract and immediately cover their ass? Would that make sense from a short sellers perspective in this scenario? 
* If not, and I'm sitting there watching as the price of the stock goes through the roof but I can't sell my calls at a relative price, **should I then exercise the contract?** 

Which leads me to my final question. I've never actually exercised a contract. ***What is the time line between exercising the contract and then being able to sell the shares?*** What's the total turnaround? I can't seem to find a clear answer to that question. 

**Any clarity or insight here will be GREATLY appreciated!**

"Gamestop share price, and Playstation console cycles.",0.92,"The three images here show the daily price of GME from the date of announcement of the Playstation 3, 4, and 5 respectively to the date of release (though obviously not yet for the PS5). I do not know how to access historical short interest data, but anybody who can and is willing to provide that information is welcome to do so.

Notably the last time that we had such a heavy drop (approximately 22%) in GME recently was September 3rd through September 11, and when we look at the the performance of the S&P 500 in that timeframe we see a drop of approximately 3.3%. October 23rd through October 27th we have a drop of approximately 2.15% compared to a drop in GME of 15%. This single stock of a company many expect to fail saw a smaller drop over the last few days relative to the performance of a diverse selection of the market. I panic sold out of my first foray into GME in early September at a significant loss. I am not doing so now despite being up 27%.

Anybody in on the console cycle should be aware of the short interest issue. I haven't any idea just who has the money for this, but based on past data I doubt that they are going to be able to hold out. Change in GME share price from announcement to release was 107% for the PS3, 123% for the PS4, and 40% thus far for the PS5.

No news, squeeze theory is dead, no technical analysis or even fundamental analysis needed, just human psychology. Retails will get paper handed as we get closer to the holidays, and need to sell for money to buy used PS3s on eBay.

MMS have a lot more resources and time than retail, and if these setups were identical under different market conditions(no rona or election) it may have actually worked out headed into a new console cycle. Unfortunately this has to come up with the perfect storm of market shit. Don’t spout the “GME doesn’t correlate or go down with S&P”. Neither do your sisters panties but they’re dropping no matter what for the Chad hedgie shorting you your FDs. Maybe if you got an announcement of Nintendo and Sony giving identical revenue share agreements, PLUS like 2 more 5% + investors announcing positions, PLUS a board vote recalling shares you’d MAYBE have a shot, PLUS a partnership with an existing E-Commerce outlet to grab gamers in store for Esports events (aka use outlets as gamer gathering hubs partnering with GOG/Steam, not their own e-commerce bullshit).

Don’t regurgitate the fundamentals about a rotating business cycle and new ventures. Somebody have an actual concrete reason for the squeeze the way things stand NOW, without several catalysts to pump the thing 100% in a week? This will be a slow bleed back down to Summer levels.

**Potential Catalysts:**

Share buybacks:

GME has 100 million left out of 300m for 2020 share buybacks to commence. This is the last time they did buybacks. I think we are due for one soon.

Console Cycle: As we know, the new consoles are out in November. Previous historical charts for console release dates confirm that this business cycle is cyclical. As the other users mentioned, highs as much as 60 have been achieved before the buybacks. 100+ adjusted for today's shares outstanding.

Ryan Cohen: Blah blah, chewy guy took a stake. Activist investor may be looking to become CEO.

Microsoft Partnership: 10% profit sharing deal on online purchases made within any console they bring into the system. Seems like free money to me.

Sony Partnership: Probably something will be announced in the future, with GME historically having a better relationship with sony in the past.

5 Ways to Beat The Market (100% Guaranteed),0.82,"If you are new here, these are some ""guaranteed"" ways (aka, not guaranteed) to beat the SPY without losing everything. You can apply the theory in your own trading strategies.

**Tobacco**

A [study](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~sternfin/mkacperc/public_html/sin.pdf) published in the Journal of Financial Economics found that “Sin” stocks beat the market by \~2% a year. This has continued for decades, through recessions and bull runs. The primary reason is that many large institutions – Hedge Funds and Pensions Funds - will look bad if they profit off of unacceptable funding sources.

With all of the energy around the green movement, oil is quickly joining the list. If you wait for the bottom, there is a good chance that you can pick up companies that will produce excess returns for decades (Tanker Gang!)

**Sell Puts**

The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) released a [white paper](http://www.cboe.com/micro/buywrite/bondarenko-oleg-putwrite-putw-2019.pdf) suggesting that writing puts will out perform the S&P 500 on a risk-adjusted Basis:

“Long-term performance. Over more than 32-year period, the PUT index outperformed the traditional indices on a risk-adjusted basis. Compared to S&P 500, PUT has a comparable annual compound return (9.54% versus 9.80%), but a substantially lower standard deviation (9.95% versus 14.93%).”

**Theta Gang - The Wheel**

Basically, if you already accumulated 100 shares of stock, you can sell covered calls. If you get assigned, you can sell cash secured puts. Make sure you keep your cost basis in mind so you don’t get blown out by a whipsaw market.

"Commercial Real Estate, CMBS delinquency, and CRE crash",0.95,"This is a bearish sentiment on the CRE market and why all signs point to their being a massive pullback, if not an outright crash in the CMBS market.

Let's take a look at the numbers and what they mean:

[The CMBS delinquency rate](https://info.trepp.com/trepptalk/cmbs-delinquency-rate-continues-retreat-from-near-all-time-high) was 9.02% in August. And many of the loans went to the reserves to bring them to current. A large swath of loans that would otherwise be delinquent or in forbearance are above water for ONE reason only, COVID relief. Without structural relief we would currently be seeing a higher delinquency rate.

What is arguably even worse, is that the percentage of loans that were in delinquency for >90days rose 1.5x, from 2.65% in July to 4.02% in August.

According to analysts in the CMBS market, they expect a decrease in delinquencies going forward. Yea they have zero stake in this game and aren't biased towards guiding sentiment towards a favorable outlook on CMBS. The delinquency rate in September was 8.92% and 9.2% in August. This decrease they see from August-September was .1%, we aren't seeing a drastic decrease in CMBS because, despite what these analysts say, the overwhelming sentiment is that the delinquency rate will increase, drastically.

Long term? The CRE market is going to crash soon. $31.2B covering 800 loans are now [in forbearance.](https://info.trepp.com/trepptalk/monthly-snapshot-cre-cmbs-clo-lending-market-updates-september-2020)

Let's talk about sentiment? Everyone in corporate America is working from home. Including myself. Guess what COVID told all of c-suite across the world? You DO NOT need office space anymore. Is WFH permanent? No, people will go back to the office. But every single one of the companies in the F500 and SP500 are reassessing their CRE needs to save on costs. Every single one of these companies now realizes their business model can largely be done outside of massive office space, and downsizing is imminent. Outside of office space, guess how many people want to spend money on hotels right now? Almost none. And with a second wave coming, we are going to see a ton of casualties.

We're seeing 2008-2011 levels for CMBS delinquency and overall performance. This time instead of residential real estate taking the brunt of the crash, this will be CRE.

GME had fails to deliver of its entire market cap in the second half of sept.  I've seen a number of posts like this, with many comments saying it won't make a difference because they won't actually be forced to deliver the shares.

My main question, is if they don't seem to ever have to deliver the shares...could that have a damaging effect on a squeeze?  Instead of covering while it squeezes, they just hold until the post squeeze crash.  Would love to have a better understanding of how this works.  I understand that this supposedly means they would have to produce the shares, but what are we looking at in reality?

$NOK Part two -- Lotto Tickets,0.96,"Well, we are awkwardly here and I am loaded up on the $NOK Calls for announcements this week. 

I will for sure be holding through earnings. 

&#x200B;

Price Target post earnings - $6.50 - changed from my $5.50 target previous. 

Why the fuck would I buy Nokia? Well, I gave you a bunch of articles and reasons last week that no one listened to so here are a few more to get your mojo running. 

&#x200B;

NOKIA has signed onto collaborate with MSFT and VW creating an Enterprise 4G/5G network. If you read my DD Last week, I told you that NOK was the ONLY COMPANY DOMINATING THIS MARKET. Guess what they just did? Signed on the two largest enterprise providers in the [UNITED STATES OF GODDAMN AMERICA](https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/verizon-puts-private-5g-focus-nokia-microsoft-partnerships).

&#x200B;

Not only are they gobbling up that market, they are also waving their massive FINNISH DICK around with Patent laws and stopping Lenovo from selling PC's/Tablets/Laptops in Germany. Whys top there? They are planning on doing the same in Brazil, India, and the [UNITED STATES OF GODDAMN AMERICA](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Nokia-blocks-Lenovo-from-selling-any-laptops-PCs-or-tablets-in-Germany-and-is-seeking-similar-injunctions-in-Brazil-India-and-the-US.498969.0.html). 

&#x200B;

I know I know. Everyone is using all of their big brain logic in 2020 and says Nokia can't get to $6.00. That's absurd. You know what's absurd? SNAP, PTON, GME, FSLY, TSLA, AND EVERY OTHER stock in the [UNITED STATES OF GODDAMN AMERICA.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/23/why-is-snap-stock-up/)

&#x200B;

That's probably not enough for you Smooth brain folks. On October 29th, Nokia is doubling down on everything. Video presentation, Slides, forward guidance, 2020 January - September results...AND MAYBE THAT GIANT ASS MENTION OF BRINGING DIVIDENDS BACK TO ... YOU GUESSED IT.. [UNITED STATES OF GODDAMN AMERICA.](https://investorplace.com/2020/10/buy-nokia-stock-before-the-company-resumes-dividends/)

&#x200B;

Long term investments are for the lollllzzzzz in this place. But boomers love that shit. You know what else they love? Shit they know about like Nokia. You know what else is awesome about Nokia? BOOMER INVESTORS ARE SAYING TO GO LONG IN THE [UNITED STATES OF GODDAMN AMERICA.](https://investorplace.com/2020/10/long-term-investors-can-consider-investing-in-nokia/)

&#x200B;

And finally, I will leave you with this. On Friday, NOK made a very subtle, and very quite close. During this close it crossed. While others are talking about the earnings reports of big tech this week, NOK is hiding in the shadows waiting for that Thursday release. By the time you second guess my DD on Tuesday of this week, it will already be too late. Wednesday we will be over $4.50 and Thursday at open we will cross $4.85. TA nerds love crosses. You know who else loves crosses? The [UNITED STATES OF GODDAMN AMERICA](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/nok/charts?mod=mw_quote_tab).

That's almost 5 big macs for the price of one. You want those 5 big macs trust me.

Revenue growth for the last few years:

2016-2017: 45%

2017-2018: 37.5%

Quarantined people are going to need sex bad and get addicted to it pretty quick (think how chinese porn is so addictive). MOMO is going to scratch that itch for them, while they also post random Facebook shit and click on ad links because they want that new chinese fleshlight or some Xiaomi (read Apple) panties for dinner.


China profits from coronavirus, has an edge over all other economies in the world for the next 5 years. Mark my words. The industrial power of these guys is retarded. They make so much GOOD shit for so little bucks, any company in the world outside China misses out if they don't do business with them.

Current numbers are showing the experienced J shape recovery on their part. Big e-commerce trend is big, which is huge for China.

In Trump words: China, China, China.

Also NIO, XIACY, BEDU, QTT, IQ, JD, and the new kid on the block freaking ANT with the biggest IPO registered in the history soon to be ADR'd.

OSTK and GME. A quick story about my first experience in the market and why I'm buying GME:,0.64,"As my first post, I want to be transparent that I'm more interested in meeting other traders who wish to do this professionally. I'm more interested in feedback. 

My first year of trading, I did not buy or sell anything. No stocks no options. I organized a watchlist of companies I loved and followed religiously while saving ~$400. Then OSTK happened.

Patrick Byrne, then CEO of overstock.com, sold a ton of his own assets and consequently tanked OSTK share price. Yadayadayada fuck it. It dipped, I made my first move, I made money on the correction yadadada and then shit got weird. Like, CEO dumping his own company, Russian spy scandal, SEC stopping trading for the day!, short squeeze, class action lawsuit weird. (Newbies, look it up)

But with my hymen busted and a fresh, bewildered look at the dirty dirty beautiful world of finance I learned what a short squeeze is. 

GME is a short squeeze that hasn't happened yet. DD in the paragraph after next.

... Some of you trade options successfully and long term. I'm struggling with the books and YouTube videos I have in regard to options trading. I can tell you I need help. I average 70% overall and 186% YTD with stocks. But it's not enough and I need help with options. It's not a secret that this sub has turned to new traders (God bless them). 

GME is a short squeeze that hasn't happened yet. A short squeeze is when a stock rockets up. It's like cranking the throttle on a new bike or pinning the pedal on your Alfa Romeo (DM me if you have a Ferrari). A short squeeze is when you look at your charts and can't make sense of how much money you've made.

🙄 A short squeeze is when a stock sells so much that the price goes up. Shares sold short (on margin) get pressure from the broker to be pushed up. For instance, GME had 89% short interest a month ago. Now it's OVER 100% short interest. To be honest, I didn't know this was possible before the beer virus but hey- anything goes right? One more time, I'll try to explain:

There are about 65 million shares of GameStop. 68 million are sold short right now. The price has been going up. Big investors have come in. Sony and Microsoft have cut deals with GameStop.

....

fuck it. I'm tired. As your wife's boyfriend, I want to tell you very much that I love you and I wish the best. Go bull on GME. *kiss on cheek. Tuck you in.*",2020-10-23 03:34:06
Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night (yolo>index funds),0.88,"Posting here because I was inspired by u/Godsandshitheads who made a fantastic post earlier today, but got their post deleted. Basically, all of society is trying to take your time, energy, and resources (referred to as “tendies” moving forward). Instead of allowing others to reallocate your tendies to different goals, everyone should grab the gay bull by the horns and take control of their financial future.

*Do not go gentle into that good night,*

*Old age should burn and rave at close of day*

If you allow it, society will eat your tendies until you are 75. The GOP, the Democrats, and the guy who skims fees for “managing” your index fund, all have an endless number of ways to distract you from accomplishing your life goals. When you are 75, you won’t care who the president was 47 years ago, but you will probably wish that you had saved more GME for a rainy day.

*Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright*

*Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,*

Don’t let your memes be dreams. A lot of people lurk here on r/WallStreetBets. I encourage you to take life into your own diamond hands and start investing in meme stocks. If you are worried you will lose your money, then cut out some spending (do you even enjoy those soy lattes?) and start buying safe investments like SPY or GME. If you do lose it all, then at least you lost it in pursuit of tendies.

*Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight*

*Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,*

It is not too late, even for boomers, to start selling covered calls on all the GME stock you have amassed. The big thing here, is that society encourages the average investor to be passive and cut a check to their money manager while inflation eats away at their purchasing power. The end goal is not to have your money making more money. The end goal is freedom.

*And you, my father, there on the sad height,*

*Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.*

*Do not go gentle into that good night.*

*Rage, rage against the dying of the light.*

My grandfather, like so many Americans before him, and so many more to come, served his country, worked hard, paid taxes, and trusted that the system would take care of him. It didn’t. He had to work until his body gave out.

He said something that continues to haunt me:

“I don’t know how you make so much money. I was never able to do anything like that. Some people are like that, everything they touch makes money.”

It's sad. He worked so hard his whole life, when a little more knowledge would have given him 20 years back with the people he loved.

Anyone can learn how to beat the market. If you passively hope an index fund will save you, then you are going to wake up at 65 and realize that fees and inflation compound too. Taxes are going to be higher, and Social Security is a wet dream. Don’t spend the best years of your life working to make other people rich.

TLDR: Don’t spend the best years of your life working to make other people rich.

Always Be Closing (learning from loss porn),0.91,"I wrote this post because there is an election around the corner, and I wanted to remind everyone that politics don’t matter. This is for anyone who cannot find their way to tendie town.

[Required Reading-Chads Only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4PE2hSqVnk&ab_channel=LucasBean)

For the half of you that were offended by that speech, I hear they are giving away free tampons at r/Investing where you can buy and hold SPY for the next 50 years.

For everyone else who belongs on r/WallStreetBets, the message is clear: if you can’t make money in the market, you have only yourself to blame.

*Coffee is for closers (embrace your loss porn)*

The Closing of the American Mind shows that 18 y/o kids in college know next to nothing and were given participation trophies their whole lives. Does this sound like the stereotypes you hear about millennials? Well, this book was written in 1987. For 50 years, Americans were told that their point of view was valid, and that they were worthy of attention. Very few people are equipped to put their ego aside and realize that they don’t know nearly as much about the world as they thought. The market doesn’t care about your opinion on global warming, your color, your degree, or your politics. If you’re *“a good father.” Good, then go home and play with your kids.*

When it comes to the market, all that counts is being right. If you have major loss porn, embrace this as the most real feedback you have ever gotten. For your whole life, you had an imperfect understanding of reality and everyone around you – your parents, friends, and teachers - were too nice (or didn’t care enough) to correct you. This is an opportunity to learn about where you went wrong and how another trader might have played the situation differently.

*First place prize is a Cadillac, the 2nd place prize… steak knives (yolo)*

A lot of famous investors, got their money from relatively few bets. It may be bitcoin, over-leveraged GME options, or Tesla calls, but one way to get rich is to find a niche that is not on the radar and bet (relatively) big.

To all the newbies: always play with money you can afford to lose and if you have a position that goes 100X, you don’t need your whole portfolio in that play. 10% is plenty. If it does not work out, at least you saved money because you didn’t need #ROPE.

*Always Be Closing (the golden rule)*

Always be closing your positions. If you have a position that is up 50%, sell half. *The market is sitting there waiting to give you the money. Are you going to take it? Are you man enough to take it?* If you won't pick it up, the market will have no sympathy for you. Novice traders try to time the top. Chad traders are constantly taking profits.

TLDR: Always Be Closing

When Genius Failed (how to never lose),0.97,"Good morning,

Ladies, gentlemen, lurkers, autists, successful traders, and Wendy’s cashiers. This is a story of how the autists at Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) built an empire and pioneered the path that 99% of WallStreetBets traders are destined to follow. Learn from the OGs or suffer their fate.

**The DD**

Back before every money manager had 15 PhDs (aka nerds) on staff, trading securities [was for retards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM6exo00T5I&ab_channel=OGF). The autists at LTCM realized that a US treasury today was worth more than a US treasury delivered next month. The difference between these prices could be captured by shorting (borrowing) the treasury in hand and buying the future treasury.

This made next to nothing, but also carried no risk since the price of the shorted treasury and the future treasury would eventually converge. *Can’t Go Tits Up*

**The DD Goes Autistic**

The truly autistic part of their plan was to multiply the trade with infinite leverage. This was possible because shorting the treasury in hand always produced more money than it cost to buy a future treasury. They also convinced (gay) Bear Stearns to forgo the “haircut” they normally took for fulfilling trades (Robinhood enters the chat).

**To The Moon**

Eventually, LTCM (150 employees) leveraged to infinity and beyond. A firm worth $4.7 billion ended up borrowing $1,000,000,000,000, back when $1,000,000,000,000 was a lot of money (roughly the GDP of China). While margins were small, the leverage allowed them to make 27% zero-risk gains (yolo). The tendie train had arrived.

**It Goes Tits Up**

On August 17th, 1998, the Russian government decided it made more sense to feed hungry Russians than pay Western bond holders. This default sent shockwaves through the bond market and LTCM was hemorrhaging 6% to 10% a month. Bonds were seen as the fortress of the investment world, but buyers were now skittish about any asset that required a counterparty. LTCM experienced a margin call.

**Diamond Hands**

The portfolio continued to fall every week. No buyers were found. Eventually, none other than Warren Buffet (that ruthless capitalist) stepped in to buy the LTCM portfolio for $250 million, which meant a stunning 94.68% loss for LTCM. Rather than brag about their loss porn on Reddit, LTCM did what anyone on WallStreetBets would do: collapse the global financial system.

**Money Printer Go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR**

As it turns out, $1 trillion in losses was enough to bring down every bank in the United States. Rather than allow these oligarchs to learn a lesson, the Fed (JPOW enters the chat) orchestrated a forced bailout to save LTCM and changed financial rules to allow the firm to recover and disband.

**What We Learned**

Sitting in that room with JPOW (1998 edition) and LTCM were: Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, Chase, Bear Sterns, etc. It was a who’s who of the 2008 Great Financial Crises. Every banker learned that you can make massive, retarded bets for short term gain and the government will step in to clean up your mess.

**TLDR (The Moral of This Story):** Market Makers never lose. You are playing a rigged game and even if you win, the government will step in and make sure the big dogs eat your tendies.

What is Cerence you might be asking as your eyes have not been able to see anything but $GME or $AMD for the past few weeks because you are all degenerate fucktards who are alive for the sole purpose of losing money. 

Cerence are the market leaders in AI and voice technology which is utilised within Automobile industry. They have been established and operating for more than 20+ years and their technology is currently used in 325M+ Cars already. They are partners with some of the biggest automobiles companies such as BMW, JAGUAR, FORD, GMC ETC. 


Cerence have recently teamed up with NIO on voice recognition and I envisage this trend unfolding against ALL EV manufacturers to provide the smart and next generation Technology for safety and Entertainment purposes. 

This is just the tip of the iceberg, they have recently began to venture in to Non-Automobile industries and have landed some big fucking contracts. 

The company is already performing very well and within the coming months and years they will be the market leaders in AI technology with their stock price estimated to match and then grow larger than the biggest competitors (NVDA, TSLA) 

This is a potential 10 bagger and in the coming months and years this is going to be astronomical. This right here would be stock which gives you an early retirement so you no longer have to sleep in your wife’s boyfriends basement every night.

The Anatomy of a WSB Pump and Dump,0.98,"**TL;DR:** There are bad actors here who are trying to scam you with their shitty DD because you are, in fact, retarded. I'll tell you how they do it based on past posts so that you can recognize when you're being hoodwinked.

**Mods:** I'm very sorry if some shithead tries to use this as a how-to manual. I think it's more useful for the community as a whole to learn how they might be getting duped.

# Why?

They do this shit because they can make a lot of money. They recommend some cheap, low volume, and way OTM contract and multiply it's value in a couple of hours. Here's a couple of pump and dumps from the last year and estimated returns the pumpers made on those contracts. And while these returns look fabulous **remember that the pumpers' gain is almost certainly your loss**.

[LL: Lumber Liquidators](http://removeddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6tthu/lumber_liquidators_ll_a_massive_turnaround_play/)  Over 600%

[MIK: Michael's](http://removeddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7bdj3/michaels_mik_has_huge_turnaround_potential_they/) Over 200% (not sure, wasn't around collecting price data that day)

[ESTC: Elastic N.V.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnwtjt/estc_soon_to_rise_an_unrecognized_beneficiary_of/) \~500%

[DXC: DXC Technology](https://www.removeddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gv6ko0/big_swinging_dxc_why_a_bad_company_will_run_from/) 200-300%

[SSSS: Suro Capital](http://removeddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ixqqjc/how_to_make_an_easy_100_on_palantirs_ipo_before/) \~300%

There's more than these that I have seen during my time on this sub; these ones are just particularly memorable. A lesser 50% return is still a very successful pump.

Two more notable ones from the comments:

[VALE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iuk3h0/wanna_play_tsla_but_no_money_vale/) Over 150%

[VZ: Verizon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ihjsoi/the_bull_case_for_verizon_why_the_stock_is_due/) Over 325%

# The securities

The pumpers carefully pick the contracts and the underlying to juice returns.

Price: **Pumpers start with very cheap contracts.** Under a dollar for sure. 0.05-0.40 is preferred. This all has to do with the logic of multiplication. The pumper's goal is to blow up a single contract and it is much easier to blast from 0.05 to 0.15 than from 5.00 to 10.00. After all, a contract that costs a total of $500 looks expensive to a smooth-brained noob, whereas a bunch of $15 contracts are more appealing as a ""little bet."" Generally, getting this sort of price on the contract requires the underlying to be cheap as well. Pumpers like to target options on stocks with prices in the $5-$50 range to avoid the no pennies rule here while keeping the options cheap.

Open interest: **Pumpers exclusively shill low OI contracts.** Low OI is a certain indicator that the pumper is the market maker. With few other market participants to correctly price the options, you will get taken for a ride when you buy from the pumper. Low OI can mean anywhere from 10s of contracts to a few thousand, depending on the price of the contract (penny contracts sometimes have a few thousand OI simply because they are cheap.)

The underlying: **Pumpers use options on stocks with market caps less than $5 billion.** Typically they will be even smaller at less than $500 million. They do this because it is aligned with the above goals of low price and fewer market participants to correctly price the steaming pile that they are shilling.

Expiration and IV: Unless WSB completely moves the market on the underlying, **pumpers make money when the time value shoots up.** **They therefore choose contracts** **that are far OTM with middling IV** (smaller cap stocks almost never have low IV) **and expirations in 2 weeks to 3 months.** They pick the far OTM contracts so that the contract's value is purely from it's time value. They pick the durations so that the contracts are still cheap (not LEAPs), but are sensitive to changes in IV so that the time value (0DTEs are less sensitive) can rocket up. They pick middling IVs so that the IV has room to pump.

# The posts

Like this post, **the pumpers use good formatting**. **Headers, bold fonts, links, pictures, graphs.** They do this because you short-attentioned goldfish won't read more than a paragraph or two, but will believe the whole text uncritically if you can pick out the main points. Granted, good formatting is part of being a good Reddit poster.

**Their logic appeals to smooth-brained novices like yourselves**. Muh short squeeze 🤡 (sorry GME tards). FREE MONEY (the LL $25 million tariff refund, the SSSS stake in PLTR). Some rich dude or hedge fund owns shares. Then they sprinkle in some smart sounding bullshit that they read in the company's latest 10-Q to justify that the company is undervalued and everyone will realize that during the next earnings call. Of course, you won't be reading the 10-Q to actually understand why that might be wrong.

**The posts are usually in the morning.** The pumper gets in their position just after the market opens, drops the post, and now sits back as the option runs up all day. As early retards see their contracts going up, they praise OP as a genius, upvote him, and send more willing morons into the trap. OP closes at the end of the day and the next day the contract implodes.

**They promise sickkk gainnzz.** ""Ten bagger,"" ""Easy 100%+,"" etc. There is no real rhyme or reason why their play should have so much upside, but they assert it, and you take the stinky bait.

**There is a TL;DR at the top (or bottom) that tells you exactly which option contract to buy.** Again, you all are such morons that you don't actually read or critically evaluate the post and you just do what OP tells you to do. *Honestly, you deserve to lose your money. Reflect on that, tard.*

&#x200B;

**Edit:** Three more very successful pumps I remembered, all by u/AveenoFresh and taking in likely 100%+ profits.

[HPQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmrv3j/why_hpq_is_on_my_watchlist_for_next_weeks_earnings/), [UNFI](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gun1mo/my_next_june_earning_play_during_this_pandemic/), [OKE](https://www.pickmojo.com/pick/ckculvltieaii0774r106nth6), I also recall him pumping Kroger and something else but can't find the posts. His very first ""DD"" I believe turned out very well and gave him a following. The rest flopped unless you got out early.

**Edit 2:** Remembered the saga of u/smartkuz. He made a couple of bear calls in early March and made a ton of money (off both pumping and being right because everything was crashing). Culminated in his ULTA DD where so many tards bought in that the stock dropped 15% that day. They were left holding a -95% bag less than a week later. I guess another hallmark of a successful pump is having a track record. Of course, it's not too hard to fake a Robinhood screenshot for a pumper to artificially boost their own.

[ULTA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkpv5a/dd_5k_to_330k_in_3_weeks_ulta_is_my_next_move/?sort=new), [Z](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fi03cg/dd_yes_you_can_buy_puts_on_zillow_z_right_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) \#2, [Z](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh6u5p/dd_turned_5k_to_165k_in_3_weeks_heres_my_grand/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) \#1, [CCRN](https://www.removeddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flaodm/dd_5k_to_365k_in_3_weeks_long_ccrn_is_the_new_play/) he got banned for the CCRN one

**Edit 3:** There were some shitty pump attempts from u/foxyfox71 not going to link them all just dig through his post history. Probably made 50%+ on STWD and a few others. Interestingly, foxyfox71 and smartkuz both made posts on EVRI 6/19 calls, though at different strikes.

Here's also a pretty stupid but wildly successful pump on [COTY](https://www.removeddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gz0fx4/coty_the_next_10_bagger/), the stock moved up 30% that day. I think OP was successful mostly because he posted on a day of peak retardation--the day before the bubble burst in early June.

**Edit 4:** As many people mentioned in the comments. lurkingsince2006 and dhsmatt2 pumped the shit out of PRPL. However, they did not do the hit-and-run options pumping I'm describing here, but played the long con on the stock and some options.

Rage Against the Machine (a guide to beating the market),0.94,"I know most of this sub is way too advanced for most of this information, but I wanted to post a general overview because stock trading is a means to an end and I have come very far in my quest to retire young. Maybe I can help someone who is getting started. 

Recommendations from the Machine

Finance recommends buy-and-holding the S&P 500 to anyone who is looking to invest their money. As everyone knows, the market has historically returned 9.8% while the average day trader returns -36.3% and quits within 2 years. In fact, if you make more than minimum wage, then you are the top 1% of all day-traders. Congratulations!

Work forever for the Machine

The truth is that while the market compounds at 9.8% a year, inflation compounds as well. Taxes will also increase before you get a chance to enjoy your nest egg at 65. Depending on how you count, this takes your return to as low as 5%/year in real growth. On top of that, these returns are averages gathered over 90 years. If there is a market crash before, or during, your retirement, you will have to return to the work force because your investments will take up to 10 years to recover.

Beat the Machine (if you are poor)

Experts say you can’t beat the market, but ordinary Americans have $5,700 of credit card debt that compounds at \~15%. This means the average American can pay off their credit card, and most forms of debt, and beat the market when considering a risk-adjusted return. 

Beat the Machine (by buying lottery tickets) 

I know [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets) is all about Yoloing weeklies on Hertz. If you are going to lose your future purchasing power to inflation, taxation, and regulation, then you might as well spend that money on lottery tickets today.

Beat the Machine (by investing In the market)

The alternative to Yolos and buy/hold is to play the stock market directly. Retail investors actually have some pretty large advantages over large institutions. 

1) Look into real estate: if you think buying stocks on margin is good for juicing returns, just know that the US government will let you leverage your money 3,233% if you are buying a home. Keep in mind that unlike the stock market, you gain on your home through appreciation, amortization, tax loopholes, and inflation.

2) Excess capital: Most small investors have jobs. If you already paid off your debt and live below your means, you can accumulate a significant amount of cash reserves that can be used to “buy the dip” during market down turns. Compare this to a hedge fund that must raise capital from new/existing investors if they experience a steep decline.

3) Time horizon: Hedge funds must show an increase in assets every quarter or they risk losing investors who can transfer their assets to another firm. If you are a retail investor, you can hold on to assets for years to get a 500% return (I’m looking at you Tanker Gang!)

4) The kiddie pool: Many institutions are just too big to take meaningful risks in small markets. It doesn’t matter if you are about to ride the short squeeze in GME, if you are HODLing your Bloc Chainz, or if you are knee deep in the GDXJ. A lot of these markets are just too small for the big dogs to enter without massively changing the fundamentals. 

Use these retail advantages by building up an emergency/Yolo fund during good times. Be willing to look at assets (10% of your portfolio) that have explosive value but need a catalyst to make those outsized returns (Bloc Chainz, oil tankers, GME, XLE, etc)

Beat the Machine (By selling options)

Once you build up a significant war chest, you can start playing options. You can *wheel* your capital (sell covered calls till assigned, then sell puts) until you cash flow 2X what you need to live a happy life, then retire. This may be as little as $500,000 if you are frugal, and as much as $1,000,000 if you want that 6-figure life.

GME long thesis: why 40$+ target is actually a humble estimate (even without the short squeeze),0.87,"Posted it as a comment elsewhere, but decided it deserves a separate post. I know that some of you are sick of GME posts, so go ahead and skip it. Only time will tell us who was right. Now to the DD.

----------------------------------------

Just a quick estimate: the last two console cycles GME's market cap was 9.7bn and 6.6bn. If we go with a conservative 3bn target with 65m shares outstanding that would be a 46$ price target. 2019 revenue was 6bn already. Take a look on Zoom. Or Peloton. PTON's revenue/mkt.cap: 600m/120b. GME revenue/mkt.cap: 6bn/700m. Are you telling that GameStop makes 10x more revenue that PTON and is valued 120x less? Now take into the account the bubbly nature of today's market and the fact that Tesla's 2019 revenue was just 4x of Gamestop's (yes, that's right, 24bn vs 6bn) we have a pretty (realistically) optimistic thesis

Now, I would argue that this console cycle could be even better for the company than any of the last two: 

* New management trying to turn the company around + Ryan Cohen who turned *dog food company* into a multibillion business
* Gaming is going to only increase in popularity
* Despite bearish arguments, GameStop actively tries to get into digital. Part of everything a person spends digitally (games, in-apps, etc) with an xbox which was sold at GameStop goes to the company. I think that is a huge additional revenue stream.
* CDs are declining only in a percentage of total sales compared to digital, but absolute numbers are not decreasing. I saw a data on that somewhere but am too lazy now to search for it so treat it as my personal opinion
* (if you like crayons) GME formed two perfect cup&handle patterns: on 1month and 1hr charts
* If that was not enough there might be countless wildcard events: Sony sharing digital revenue (not that much of a stretch), any other partnership with major gaming entities, share buybacks (was in the past so not off the table), some new investors, or any of the ideas they come up to let GameStop live and prosper


Now if we speculate that GameStop's market cap would only be 9bn (was one cycle ago) we have a share price of 138$ per share.

The short squeeze is just a cherry on top of that, propelling the price up faster and higher. But we can also play that. The new short interest data comes out on Oct 26th, so we'll have a more clear picture of what is happening on the short side. Right now I see 51% fee rate on IBKR with 500k shares available to short (yesterday it was 120k and 53%)

This is not going to be your next GME.

If you are looking for VIX strategies, this is not your thread.

This is a straight forward ITM call, which I believe is at a good price to buy in at. I am only in for $505.

EDIT: For emphasis, you should not hold this through any event that creates you solid gains. You are only there to collect for the moment, and then get out. This may be technically an ETN, but you're dealing with an option, that is based on futures, but traded like a stock, so remember that it is not a typical equity. It is not specifically leveraged, but it does dry out.

https://preview.redd.it/3td7ahcdjdt51.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce66c31f1cbce2811f2c0aef1b470d0b50b981ef

**VXX 21 01 15 C20 @ $5.05 I purchased today near close** (sorry it's not an impressive amount, if you check the actual VIX options instead, you'll find the bigger players). They may be less tomorrow morning, or they may not be, but I think it's important to make a decision quickly in case tomorrow has a selloff and volatility raises the premium cost.

**VXX is currently at 22.15 as I type this**, after closing on a steady decline today, while stocks tried lazily and slowly to consider a rally back from off-hour declines.

This call needs a gain of about 11 1/2% to break even at that price. That's not little, and unless there is an actual crash, this will not likely make you triple your money by Reindeer season, but I believe it's still a solid play for solid gains, \*\*\*\***as long as you realize that the selling window, when you profit, is crucially important\*\*\*\***. You don't have to time the event that causes the spike, but you will have to be ready to sell for profit almost immediately when something warrants it, so set your alerts up. **Missing an event, which is your opportunity to sell for profit, is not part of the plan**. You have to be ready to sell via your mobile device, and have a profit taking limit set that you can live with, in the event that you are busy doing something less important than staring at VIX futures and trying to compute how the hell it translates to the VXX correlation. If you need instructions on how to set a limit, or use a broker that does not do GTC for whatever reason, this may not be for you.

**Here's the bet:**

**Almost any important macro event of uncertainty** **before January** **will have the potential to create an opportunity** **to take a realistic profit** **due to general nervousness,** and the likelyhood of any random selloff causing a brief, but large enough spike, to allow you to cash in on VXX, as long as you get in while it's not overly expensive. It's not as fancy of a play as VIX, but it also handles very differently, and is easier to deal with for small traders. **Because A Cash Covered VXX Call can be excercised at any time, unlike VIX futures which can also add spread costs and are more complex in nature,** a VXX call gives you the opportunity to take profit at any given spike. My belief is that 25% will be the minimum gain if you get in at a good price. I'm not knocking VIX, this just happens to be more accessible for small accounts, and much less complicated.

**Your enemy is time**, **but** giving your call a date of January 15th means you hit a number of chances for a large move due to general nervousness. Remember, your seller is betting that you will not exercise your call, or sell to someone who will, at all. That's their primary goal. This is not a buy and hold until expiration strategy by any means. The reason for the duration is because it will give a large window of time without pushing your break even into something that is purely FD territory.

**You have in this time frame**:

**An election**,

a **supreme court justice nominee**,

**fear of the recent market adjustments** becoming more regular,

**uncertainty as to where to move money** when market corrections happen,

but also too **many holidays** to mention (this part is **very important**),

and an almost certain continuation of **worry about COVID 2.0** because holidays could very well increase infection rates massively.

And yes, everyone has already considered playing or hedging with volatility through the election cycle, and VIX options are priced accordingly, but 2020 is not a normal year, and VXX is not VIX.

Best of luck, to you.",2020-10-16 04:01:27

Fails-to-deliver data is out. GME,0.96,"Fails-to-deliver data shows basically whichever stocks have been short sold where the shorts are underwater. Note that this is not always the case, but given GME's amazing 150% short interest I think we know why these fails-to-deliver happened.

We can see here that the number of fails to deliver decreased after the spike to $10 was over. Judging by this pattern the more massive spike to $14 should have caused many more fails to deliver.


Edit 1: Judging by the dates they entered, shorts should be forced to start covering as early as next week. They may be forced to cover earlier due to margin calls, or choose to start covering earlier to minimize losses.

Positions: Calls at least a month out, shares.

Don't be a baby and buy $50 calls expiring tomorrow, then ask me why it didn't print.

\-Short Squeeze-Epic Microsoft Deal-Turn Around King CEO

But, I thought to my self... did BlockBuster, ever turn it around? They laughed in the face of change, what makes you Daivey1, think that GME is different? You know, people don't change, why would companies?

So, I decided to pull up the 10-Q and take a look at the Q2 report (August 3rd, if anyone even read it.) LOL, if anyone looked at their 10-Q, I love how their management team tried to hide the fact that their **sales were DOWN 26.7% from same quarter last year.**

At the top of their 10-Q, they parade the fact that their eCommerce was up 800% and, costs were down biggly, BUT, of course, the important news -SALES- that part does not get nice Big Burly Bold Font... Nope, that gets the usual size 12, Arial font, to help it blend in with the rest of the shit 10-Q.

As I am perusing this fine specimen of a 10-Q, I take a look at the sales mix.

**Last year in august, for 26 week ended GME sold $1.2 billion in consoles and $1.3 billion in software.**

**This year in august, for 26 week ended GME sold $955 million in consoles and $803 million in software.**

Oh, shit, their sob story goes on about how ""well 2020, is the end of the console cycle, blah blah blah"".

How, the fuck, during COVID, do your software sales go DOWN. I will give them a BREAK on console sales (*EVEN though, back in March-April-May-June-July, YOU Couldn't find a used X-box, Nintendo, PS to save your life, and GameStop had new consoles in stock!).*

Like legit, every software sales company in the world has GONE UP during covid ""stay home stocks"".

***But, but, but, but, THE MICROSOFT DEAL is a FREE LUNCH!***

That's a good joke. I thought about it for a while. Someone in another thread posted about how Microsoft will pay them $1.50 commission on GamePass sold per month, and it equates to something like $180 million in easy profit over the next few years...

Umm, do you yall realize that in order to earn a commission, you need to sell something first, right? How does GME plan to do that, when they can't even sell one of the hottest commodities during COVID?

And even if the Microsoft deal is as lucrative as thought and they keep chugging at their CURRENT sales volume, the Microsoft deal doesn't even cover the difference between the lost sales between 2020 and 2019.....

But Ok, the 2nd Q is during the summer... Not notorious for video gaming. It's X-Mas that counts, Right?

Think about this, if summer sales were 26% higher LAST YEAR, wtf is Christmas going to look like this year? Specially if that Stimulus doesn't pass and with unemployment edging higher?

The incentive to buy from GME, when Amazon, BestBuy, Walmart offer the same product and likely more trusted from an adult perspective....

The Time for GME is NOW,0.92,"Way too many tards here have shoved GME down your throat. So lets cut to the chase.

**The short rate today has spiked to a whopping 53%** from 26.5% yesterday. What this means is that shorts are getting burned really, really badly.

Take a look at [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME). For all you retards, whenever the available stonks to short is high, the borrow/short rate is low. When the available stonks is really low, the short rate is balls high. These past few days, we've had very few stonks available to short, so short rate was really high.

**So here are some observations:**

* **9/15 to 9/18**, GME short rate spiked from around 30% to 60%. And correspondingly its price mooned from about $6.86 to $9.20. **A moon of 35%.**
* From **4/10 to 4/30**, GME short rate went from around 38% to an insane 190%. And in this time, GME went from 3.60 to 5.87. It **blew up 63%**.

So the point is our growth in short rate as of recent is resembling one of those above events. The short squeeze is upon us!

&#x200B;

**The play:**

\- A whole lotta stonks

\- Nov $13-$15 area calls and Jan $13-$20 area calls.

More detail on GME revenue sharing agreement,0.93,"Yes, yes, I know what some of y'all are thinking: ""fuck outta here with another GME post"", but more details have emerged about the revenue sharing agreement between GameStop and Microsoft that I thought would bring some clarity for GME gang and you sad saps who are going to miss the train.

When the news first launched, there was much debate about whether it was just a cut of initial sales or continued revenue sharing. As it turns out, DOMO Capital has confirmed that GameStop will be getting a cut of ALL downstream revenue related to systems they sell.

\-GameStop will share revenue of all digital content: DLC, full-game downloads, microtransactions, XBOX game pass, movies, etc.

\-Applies to both new and pre-owned systems. If someone bought the Xbox at Walmart and then sold it to GS, they would get a share of revenue on that system once it is resold

\-Incentivizes GameStop to push XBOX. What does this mean? If talks are not already underway, expect Sony and Nintendo to reach similar agreements so that Microsoft doesn't get preferential treatment. They certainly don't want to miss out with GameStop being the largest reseller of systems

&#x200B;

Does anyone really think GameStop is going to turn around? No, not likely. But the conditions for a squeeze are growing every day.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Analysts are missing a lot of the potential upside here, even if only temporary. Buy calls and shares and fuck these shorts as hard as you can. Choo choo, ride this train ya retards!

Options 101 Episode 3: Lowering Your Cost Basis With A PMCC,0.97,"# Introduction

It's ya boi Tatar back with episode 3 of my option series. I took a little hiatus due to finding out my wife is pregnant. I'm very happy for her and her boyfriend and can't wait to raise the child as my own! Anyways, episode 2 was all about the vertical spread and if you haven't read it yet you can find it [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ijo98s/options_101_episode_2_leveling_up_to_the_vertical/) I will be referring to the Greeks a lot in this post, if you don't know about options Greeks, read [episode 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iewqhw/options_101_episode_1_an_introduction_to_the/) and you'll understand more of those weird, confusing words I'll be referring to later.

Topics I'm going to cover include:
- What Is A PMCC?
- How To Select Your Long Call
- Where To Sell My Short?
- What If The Underlying Blows Past My Short?
- How To Roll Your Short Call Effectively

There will be no TLDR. If you can't read you don't deserve tendies. Class is in session.

# What Is A PMCC?

PMCC stands for Poor Mans Covered Call. It could also be considered a diagonal spread or a calendar spread, but for the purpose of this post we are going to focus on PMCC.

You set up a PMCC by going long a call option and selling a call option using your long as collateral. This way, you don't have to own 100 shares and can earn some of that sweet, sweet premium at a fraction of the cost while still reaping the rewards of option buying degeneracy.

Keep in mind that your short option must be **closer** to expiration than you long option, and the strike is **greater or equal** to the strike of your long.

Lets say stock XYZ is trending at $53. An example would be going long XYZ 50c 1/15/21 and selling XYZ 55c 10/16/20. The idea is that you sell calls for as long as you want to hold on to the long in order to make passive income and lower your cost bases.

A PMCC has a unique Greek profile; it's a positive Delta, positive Vega, and positive Theta play. This means that you gain value as the price moves up, you gain value as IV increases (and lose it when it decreases), and Theta decay is in your favor. You will also be selling Gamma, but this can be neutralized by good rolling technique.

# How To Select Your Long Call

If you're not interested in setting up a PMCC in order to collect premium and would rather just buy vanilla calls and make a little premium on them to lower your cost basis, skip to the next section.

The two components in this are 1) stock selection 2) expiration/strike and 3) leverage. A lot of this will come down to personal preference, but there are a few things to keep in mind when entering this position. For the purpose of this section, I will be defining RISK as the chance that the play will no longer be profitable by selling options.

1) Stock Selection

Although a PMCC requires you to sell a call, this is a bullish play, so keep that in mind. For beginners who just want to get their feet wet this is probably the easiest part as you can simply just choose a stock you like that's in your price range. Keep in mind that the main risk of this strategy is when the underlying shoots below the strike of your long call, so don't be retarded and blow your load on GME or NKLA.

If you want to maximize your edge and take advantage of the positive Vega, you can select tickers with low IV Rank and IV Percentile. **Side note: I was going to make a post about IV Rank/Percentile first, but didn't think it was necessary to learn about that for the purpose of PMCC. My next post will be about this topic**

2) Expiration/Strike

There are a few rules of thumb when choosing where to purchase your call. The longer out you select your expiration, the less theta burn you have over time and the cheaper the option is to own per week through the life of the option (this is calculated by dividing the number of weeks until expiration by the price of the option). Basically, the farther out you buy your call, the more efficient it will be for generating income over the life of the call. Think of choosing the expiration as choosing how efficient you want your play to be.

Strike price is a lot more important IMO and it's where most of the risk lies, because if the underlying plummets below your strike you're fucked. The deeper ITM you buy, the more the option replicates the stock and the safer it is.

3) Leverage

Simply put, leverage is the price of 100 shares of the underlying divided by the premium spent on the option. The idea being that you have exposure to 100 shares for a fraction of the price it would be to purchase 100 shares.

The mover levered you are, the less risk you are exposed to and the more efficient your returns will be.

Purchasing the option is a balancing act between risk, efficiency, and leverage. The risk is in the strike price, the efficiency is in the expiration, and the leverage is in how much you're wanting to pony up to enter the position. Find out where your sweet spot is and act accordingly.

# Where To Sell My Short?

So you've purchased your long call, and are ready to gain some theta. Don't listen to the guys at r/thetagang who tell you to sell 1 month out and close at 50% profit, you're leaving gains on the table for no reason other than it's less maintenance to manage the position. Sell weeklies!

There are two main principles here to keep in mind:

1) The farther OTM you sell your option, the less premium earned (obviously)
2) The more your call goes ITM, the harder and more expensive it is to roll.

Many like to sell their calls around .3 Delta, which is typically about a 10% increase in the underlying. I typically sell mine around .4 to .45, which ends up being close to double the amount of premium earned. My thought process is that I want to maximize my profit if the stock trades sideways, and if the stock shoots up I'm earning intrinsic value in my long as opposed to earning premium.

If you're new to this, I would recommend selling a few at .3 Delta until you understand how the trade behaves. 

# What If The Underlying Blows Past My Short?

Quick answer: Roll UP and OUT. **The most important thing in this play is to protect your long call**

Rolling your option means selling the current one, and buying one at a later date and higher strike price. Since the longer DTE option has more extrinsic value, you can often do this either as a neutral trade or for a credit. Lets go through three scenarios to see how we can manage these trades.

# How To Roll Your Short Call Effectively

Rule of thumb- unless you have a good reason to, don't let any days go by without having a short call. Every day without a short call is less theta earned. Also, you want to buy back the contract when it has the lowest amount of extrinsic value, which is Friday.

Scenario 1- You sell XYZ 50c and the underlying is OTM or slightly ITM

Wait until the extrinsic value is near zero, wait until Friday afternoon and buy the option back and immediately sell your next play at your desired Delta level. We do NOT want to let the contract expire for two reasons: 1) take advantage of weekend theta decay and 2) in the event the underlying shoots up AH, you aren't at risk for assignment. This is best case scenario.

Scenario 2- You sell XYZ 50c and the underlying is ITM by 5-10%

Here, our goal is to buy the option back and to sell one expiring the following week at a HIGHER strike price. This allows us to increase the distance between the strikes, which is a good thing for us. If the option is ITM by ~10% in Thursday afternoon, I will consider rolling then instead of waiting until Friday but I will typically wait until Friday morning-ish. In this scenario, I will look for as even of a trade as I can but it may be possible to do this for a credit, but again that is your personal preference. When we do this, we won't be earning any premium the following week.

Scenario 3- You sell XYZ 50c and it it moons up 10-20% or more

Our goal here is to PROTECT OUR LONG CALL. I will take a look at how much extrinsic value it has, and once it gets close to the underlying price I will roll at that point. The difference between this and scenario 2 is that you may have to roll it out multiple weeks as opposed to 1, and you may have to roll it out before Thursday, depending how fukt you are. Still, this situation can be rectified and it a good position to be in at the end of the day because you're making bank on your long call.

Care to talk GEX?,0.91,"Today GEX (Gamma exposure) closed at its [highest level ever.](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix?) 

&#x200B;

[S&P and GEX 10\/13\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/nhatmg16zys51.png?width=1901&format=png&auto=webp&s=f58fa864882dbddca066ed4ddc51ac1fd61e1a7c)

Now, some of you may yell stonks only go up I don't care about gamma rays. However it is important, and can help you make money if you pay attention to it in times like this. If you need a refresher on what gamma is here is some background.

An options Delta is the chance that an contract will expire ITM. For instance, deep ITM contracts delta will be close to 1.00 because it has a near 100% chance of profitability. While an OTM contract will have deltas closer to 0.

Gamma is literally the derivative of delta, or the rate of change of delta. Its value will show how much a contracts delta changes when the underlying stock goes up or down $1. So if your OTM contracts delta changes from 0.1 to 0.3 when GME moves up $1 that contracts gamma at that time would be 0.2.

Gamma shouldn't be ignored because it shows you the rate of change of your chances of ""winning"" in real time. Imagine a coin flip where in mid air the chance of landing tails changes from 50% to 60%, pretty solid information.

&#x200B;

**What does high GEX mean?**

A high GEX means the market is currently skewed towards call options. A GEX of 15,000,000,000 means that for every 1% move down on the S&P, MMs have to SELL 15B shares they bought as hedges for the calls they sold. A high GEX puts the breaks on the current market price action and means MMs expect a change to happen soon.

&#x200B;

This chart (although a day old and doesn't show the 15B spike today) shows that high GEX doesn't mean an immediate market crash. In fact in the past year GEX is only a decent indicator of corrections in the mid term future. However a GEX of 15 Billion has never been seen before and we should keep a close eye on it and DIX to get a better idea about where we are going this month.

Your order is received and processed accordingly.

The uncooked pizza is then automatically transferred to an oven conveyor belt. Your pizza is cooked to complete perfection without any human error. The pizza is then boxed by the only employee in the store and carried over to the autonomous Dominos car.

GME short interest - a summary,0.91,"As we all know by now GME is highly shorted. But how high is it actually? [Marketwatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gme) latest update is 

* **09/30/20 -- Short interest:   68,63M  (141,12% of Public float)** 

&#x200B;

* Well a lot happened since and i went through sec .txt files and cumulated the stats to save you the time

|Date|Daily short volume|Daily shorts closed|Daily Volume (Ratio)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|10/01/20| 1.043.391 | 12.534 | 2.043.037  (**51,07%**)|
|10/02/20| 792.632 | 12.498 | 1.801.888  (**43,99%**)|
|10/05/20| 758.083 | 8.517 | 1.394.231 (**54,37%**)|
|10/06/20| 1.259.172 | 25.305 | 2.206.551 (**57,07%**)|
|10/07/20| 940.815 | 25.625 | 1.605.517 (**58,60%**)|

|10/13/20| 2.435.954 | 6.502| 4.445.148 (**54,80%**)|
|cumulated|**59.086.090**| **1.659.964** |**110.451.096**  (**53,50%**)|

&#x200B;

* So if we add the **59.08M shorts** to the **68,63M** we had on 09/30 and subtract the **1.66M** that were closed in the meantime we get a total of **126M** in short interest
* Public float is **48.63M**, that means that a staggering **259,1%** of float is now shorted
* Public float? what is that you ask? Well those are the shares outstanding in hands of public investors

GME shorts covering without causing squeeze,0.67,"Can GME shorts literally just not buy 100000 calls and exercise them to cover? I'm srs. Hear me out.

Obviously that's a huge premium, but wouldn't buying an exorbitant amount of calls **at the same time** *reduce* losses greater than directly covering shorts? This is because if the shorts buy back, the stock increases each time they buy back in but if they just exercise a shit ton of options **all at once** then the shares are immediately transferred without changing the stock price.

Of course this is simplified-- shorts would have to buy options on different expiries maybe but in theory would this not be a better play for them?",2020-10-13 01:10:05
Why GameStop's partnership with Windows 95 destroys short seller thesis,0.92,"GameStop closed today with a market cap of roughly 765million which is a arguably still priced for bankruptcy. GameStop is also cash strong with cash on hand of about **$12 per share**. The recent partnership with Microsoft is the nail in the coffin for the short's thesis of near term bankruptcy.

Let's take a closer look at the announcement. The key word is **""multi-year""**

""GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) (“The Company”) today announced that it has entered into a **multi-year** strategic partnership agreement with Microsoft Corp""

From a recent article today ""After Gamestop's 368% Rally, Is This as Good as It Gets?"" and I quote.

""Coupled with arguably one of GameStop's most important developments, the just-announced **10-year agreement with Microsoft** to modernize the retailer's back-end operations and expand its digital and physical game options, there is hope for the company's future.""

Does the agreement suggest that GameStop will survive for another **10 years**? If so it is 10 more years then the shorts expected.

It also seems that some analyst have been dismissive over the details of the agreement. The recent partnership involves **""revenue sharing""** which will benefit GameStop\*\*.\*\*

Verified by an email from DOMO Capital's **Justin Dopierala** to GameStop. Here is GameStop's response:

"" GameStop and Microsoft will both benefit from the customer acquisition and **lifetime revenue** **value** of each gamer brought into the Xbox ecosystem.""

GameStop is trading at a discount with or without the partnership. It is my belief that GameStop is just getting started & although the sentiment is slowly shifting GameStop's management seems to be moving faster than ever before. With only one month away from away from the biggest console release ever will Nintendo and Sony join in?

Let the games begin!

GME - Here is how much the MSFT deal is worth.,0.93,"Michael Pachter, of Wedbush, detailed how this works:

For example, if a customer signs up for the $15 monthly Xbox Game Pass Ultimate at a GameStop store, we would expect GameStop to receive $1.50 or so from that monthly revenue stream for as long as the customer continues to subscribe. If instead, the customer signs up for Xbox All Access for $35/month, GameStop would share $3.50 per month for 24 months.

Further:

That's right. In years 3 and 4 combined, if just 5 million customers extend the subscription for two years, GameStop makes $180 million in incremental profit with zero cost involved. That's nearly a quarter of GameStop's current market cap in recurring income at 100% margin!",2020-10-12 17:35:55

The REAL Greatest Short Burn of the Century Pt 2: The Two Towers ($GME),0.96,"""Another $GME post?"" Sounds like you've made up your mind. Just downvote me and buy puts. Cya later.

As for the rest of the open-minded. Let me be clear: **IT HAS BEGUN**.

Did you pay attention [last time](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ip6jnv/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century/)? If so, I hope you traded without emotion and made money. 

Or did you ignore that wall of text and think you missed the $GME train? Fear not. The best is yet to come. 

They say the original is always better than the sequel, but *not* in the case of $GME. This second leg is going to go better I than expected. And I didn't take any adderall today, so this post will be short and sweet.

**To recap**:

* $GME has a massive short float - It actually **increased** from 55M shares short before earnings to OVER 73M AS OF 10/10/2020. **THIS IS A WHAT THE F- MOMENT**. Mr Market is handing you the deal of a lifetime on a silver platter. Don't pass it up or worse, fumble the ball (no life savings on FDs please).
* $GME is massively undervalued because their books are strong (net cash anyone?).
* $GME is in the midst of a turnaround story (RyanCohen+ReggieFilsAime).
* Due to TINA (there is no alternative), ZIRP (zero interest rate policy), Robinhood, and WSB, meme stonks and retail are not a joke and should be seriously considered.

One thing to clarify from my previous post: Turns out Kenny G (Citadel) isn't going to work with us right now. Unfortunate, but not a big deal. They will join us in part 3.

Reason: Although the MM delta hedging math is correct, short % of float is NOT A TRIGGER NUMBER. There is no significance to the 100%+ short float. It just means it is high. Shorts are willing to pay insane borrowing fees to continue to short $GME on the thesis that they'll go bankrupt. So WSB monkey YOLO FD strategy will NOT cause a short squeeze. This much is obvious now. 

**Current day**:

Ok we're done with the flashbacks. We'll cover 3 main topics very quickly. Short float, trendline, and news.

**1) Short float:** 

It's always hard to get this data. But as discussed on the @TheRoaringKitty stream, ORTEX is quoting **73M SHARES SHORT** of $GME. ShortSqueeze is quoting 68M, but their data always lags and isn't very accurate. Either way, SHORTS ARE DOUBLING DOWN ON THEIR POSITION. 

This puts longs in a better position because of the inherent pent-up demand w/ regard to the short covering in the future. However, this reeks of $TSLA bankwupcy news cycles pre-Q3'19 earnings. So expect a lot of hate coming our way from many news outlets. Don't lose your conviction. We'll be here to reassure you. For example, CNBC just put out a massive 12 minute hit piece on GME. Expect much more of this to come. This is the mother of all HODLs. Being contrarian is never popular, but it is lucrative.

Stand strong against the Two Towers (BlackRock and Fidelity).

**2) Trendlines:**

I came across this [tweet](https://twitter.com/Alvan_Chow/status/1315211740649410560) from a megabull on Twitter. This graph roughly matches the [console cycle graph here](http://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_240233258.jpg).

I believe there is credence to this trendline. But expect it to be rocky. Buy every dip. And if you're unemployed and want to watch markets all day, sell every spike.

If you're a mid-term gambler/investor like myself, buy and hold shares and Jan'21 $30Cs. I would not recommend you set limit orders if you have a fascist broker like Fidelity (which caps at +50%). $GME can easily pop 50% in a day. Also, according to S3 research, who I support, shorts and brokers are proven to be [manufacturing synthetic shares](https://www.shortsight.com/short-interest-of-float-2-0/) in order to short more, meaning our limit sells does nothing except limit our own potential gains.

**3) News:**

To go on the record: the MSFT partnership is a nothing-burger. Even if you include the implied revenue-sharing agreement, the news content is very lukewarm. HOWEVER, the fact that this stupid piece of news moved $GME 50% in one day shows how primed for launch this stonk is. Imagine a real partnership with Sony and Nintendo (Reggie Fils Aime with the lay-up). Or imagine $GME launches a digital gaming platform (Steam competitor). Kaboom.

There will be a massive battle of bulls and bears on the news cycle. Ignore everything except for SEC filings from GME and tweets from @GameStop itself. Everything else is a shill for a position (I suppose even this post).

Watch especially close for Ryan Cohen news. My spidey senses say he will be the final match to light up the shorts (tender offer, board position, executive position, or outright purchase).

**TL;DR - $GME is just about to go parabolic. Get on now. Your diamond hands will turn to diamond rings.**

Positions:  $GME shares and Jan'21 $30C.  If there is a -10%+ dip and cheap OTM weeklies, I'll buy those as well. $100 can easily turn to $10K as seen on Thursday.

Feel free to ask any questions or dispute any fact. I love talking $GME and will do my best to answer your question.

*Edit (10/17/2020): DOMO Capital spoke with $GME IR and has confirmed a revenue sharing agreement with Microsoft. The deal is no longer a ""nothingburger"". $GME continues the trend towards digital. Big news.",2020-10-12 05:22:07
$ATVI --- From Shadowlands to Valhalla,0.82,"Don’t mind my DD but I just finished snorting some G-Fuel and wiped on a Heroic 25 man N’Zoth raid so I'm giving my due deliginence on this fuck of a game/company. I am almost 22 and have been addicted to World of Warcraft (WoW) since like 5th grade. WoW has been the heroine in my veins for the longest time and I am officially putting an end to this toxic relationship (I have tried quitting plenty of times before and always came crawling back). There are a ton of different reasons on why I am stopping (this isn’t my diary so i'm getting straight to the DD) but the biggest reason has to do with the future of the game and how the end is near. Go take a look at WoW’s major streaming content (Asmongold, Payo, Rich, Sodapoppin, Savix). Go take a look at WoW subscription numbers and you’ll understand what I mean. Go check out WoW’s most recent delay of their upcoming expansion, it's very similar to their worst launch ever of a video game (Warcraft 3 Reforged). I could write an entire college thesis on the future of World of Warcraft and all the shitty parts of the game. Moral of the story, this game is dying faster than GME.

If you have read this post so far you are prolly a gay bear and thinking “puts puts puts” but no. As I do believe this expansion is going to be THE most god awful thing to ever happen to World of Warcraft since Warlords of Draenor, I think this bad news is going to be a real “buy the dip faggot” type of opportunity for ATVI. When this expansion comes out it's going to be a publicity hurricane like no other. I have no numbers or anything to back this up besides when I picture this happening my balls tingle real good. This expansion is gunna be like a shit stain for ATVI that won’t be able to be washed out, but how can you smell that over a new pair of Brunello Cucinelli pants (COVID). COVID has created a recipe for financial success, made an easy way to increase margins, and the given potential to grow revenue from 32A to 36H tities. But at the end of the day it's tough to sell a shit product.

Now this next earnings for ATVI is brighter than any other company out there. They have perfected the art of putting in as little effort possible in order to maximize seasonal revenues (Christmas is right around the corner faggots). From personal experience I know how good Blizzard is at taking people’s money. I think the best way to explain ATVI’s art at exploiting people’s addiction is like that gold digger chick that gives “free” blowjobs. In reality you have to bring her out to lunch (buy new expansions), take her to a movie theatre (pay subscriptions), order takeout for dinner (pay to win), and let her sleep at your place (bad content) just to get a blowjob before she leaves in the morning. You get these “free” blowjobs for almost 10 years of your life and then you realize you can go to the alley out back with a jar of peanut butter and get the same results (old 2007 video games). 

I like to think that when one era ends a new era begins. This is ThE sTarT oF soMEthIng uNiQuE for ATVI aka REMASTERING OLD GAMES. Why put the effort into making a new game from scratch when you can just remake/reskin/update games from the past that people loved. It’s pretty much the same thing Disney is doing with their “Live Action Movies''. It's an endless cycle of recreating titles that are instant money grabs for simps who miss their childhood (Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 & 2, the next Black Ops, Crash Bandicoot 4, WoW classic, etc). This is where the easy/big money is going to be made in their future. 

I like to think that quitting WoW before was never successful for myself because I didn’t have anything to replace it. Now I will trade one addiction (WoW) for my next (stonks). I see this play as my only way to properly make all my money back that I gave to ATVI and transition from one addiction to another. The way is no longer to Shadowlands but instead to Vahlaha. God's speed faggots.

Btw I still have 3 prepaid months left on my WoW subscription so I think that's a good time frame to place my calls.

"GME bears and naysayers, let's have a discussion.",0.79,"The general bear sentiment I see here is ""hurr durr another Blockbuster"" without much arguments besides that. Some even compare it to NKLA (a fraud company with no business under it besides pretty renders). 
I'm very bullish on GME, mainly for the short squeeze of a lifetime, but a solid argument could still be made for a company itself.

Here I'll try to list main bear points, comment if I forgot something, I'll add it to the post. My goal is to build the most precise model of what is happening and I do not want to blindly follow the hype train, so please criticize what you think is wrong and together we'll find the truth.

**1. The squeeze already happened, from 5 to 15**

Facts: most shorts were in at 7$ and therefore were slightly underwater at 9. Yes, we've had huge volume during Thursday and Friday and one may say that all shorts covered already. However, half the volume (about 50m) during those couple of days were new shorts (source: http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html). So if we even accept the premise that all 60m shorts covered we still have 50m shorted which is close to 100% float again. The reality is that there are probably quite a number of old bears still holding the line and who are heavily underwater.

This is what REAL short squeeze looks like: [VW Oct 2008 The Great Squeeze](https://149346666.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/volkswagen-short-squeeze.png)

Also, look at shares available to short: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME

**2. Gamestop has a dying business model and is not going to last long-term**

Well yes, but you're looking at what Gamestop was. They are actively trying to turn the company's course around right now with a help from Ryan Cohen who at the very least has an excellent experience in managing and growing retail business. In itself it might be a questionable bullish case, but the market has a GameStop bankruptcy priced-in at 7$ and a perspective of a turn-around is a massive deviation from that common sentiment.

About the long-term thing: go to fucking /r/investing for that. Nobody's telling that this company is going to be a beast in 20 years time. The main point is that they're not dying, possibly growing somewhat and have an enormous potential for a huge squeeze. The following year or two after the consoles release are going to be explosive as it has been every time before, which is also enough time for management to come up with new ways for a company to live besides selling games and consoles.

My wild guesses: PC bangs, e-sports involvement, gaming stuff (I know they already are, but there is a lot of space to grow in that direction)

Michael Burry involvement is also a somewhat convincing argument.

**3. Strong balance sheets**

You are seriously telling me that a market cap of 700m$ is adequate for a company which generated 6.5b$ revenue in 2019, having 2.3b$ in assets and 700m$ with cash on hands? And a company during the new console season which historically drive the price up to the tits

**4. Physical sales are decreasing compared to digital**

Yes, in percentages. But you should also account for the overall growth of the gaming market, and an argument can be made that total numbers are not decreasing that much. Now excuse me on this one, I can't manage to find exact stats in numbers and not in percentages (I've seen it a while ago somewhere on this sub), so if anyone has it please post.

**Summary:**

* Gamestop isn't going to go bankrupt anytime soon 

* It is being overshorted with the premise that it is going to be bankrupt 

* The company actively tries to change it's course, so we would have a lot of positive news incoming 

* Every tiny piece of positive news is being multiplied tenfold by the short-sellers being underwater 

* Shares are heavily underpriced on what GME has right now in cash and revenue, and we're not even talking about possible company's revival 

* We're at wsb, not at fucking /r/investing. I always thought wsb was all about high-risk high-reward calculated bets. And here we have a perfect storm waiting to happen

GME DD Discussion: Short Interest is Increasing,0.78,"[GME Short Interest as &#37; of Shares Outstanding over Last 12 Months](https://preview.redd.it/mt5wiofg5hs51.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3c264b85d3719dc92729aa79d6af34c935f59bf)

I encourage everyone to do some DD and think critically rather than follow the memes / hype and continue shouting ""short squeeze"". I own a bunch of calls and am considering trimming positions a little to take some profits. I figured it would be good to consolidate together a bunch of the DD and points I've seen on this sub over the last month

I understand the short squeeze theory: right now \~106% of shares outstanding and more like \~150% of the public float is shorted.

For a short squeeze, you need one of these things to happen:

* A large shareholder rapidly buying shares and then saying they are not going to lend these shares out (see what happened with Porsche-Volkswagen in 2008)
* Merger & acquisition rumors / speculation
* Change in long-term prospects of the business that fundamentally changes the thesis of everyone short
* Catalyst for capitulation of the shorts (i.e. they realize they are wrong / are losing too much money in the short-term and close out positions)

In the case of GME:

* Shorts have not started capitulating - the short interest chart above shows short interest as % of shares outstanding actually increasing over the past several months
* The Microsoft news is a bit of non-news, but could also be a positive:
   * The partnership does not appear to have any meaningful economics for GME
   * However, the positive signaling is that why would Microsoft announce a long-term partnership with GME if they don't think it will be around for at least a couple more years
   * Longer-term, if the partnership is valuable for Microsoft, there could be more meaningful support / economics provided to GME
* Ryan Cohen (Chewy Co-Founder) has taken a meaningful stake (just shy of 10%)
   * Helps remove a large % of shares out of the public float
   * If he gets more involved, perhaps he has a vision for how to transform GME in a more digital videogame world - this would be a big catalyst
* Michael Burry still owned a meaningful chunk as of 6/30/2020 - will be interesting to see what his holdings look like on the next report date (by large chunk, I mean \~4.2%)
* Most importantly, the thesis of hedge funds that are short has not changed - the medium-term prospects of GME are bleak, especially after the initial wave of foot traffic from the console sales
   * Mall traffic is down - COVID only accelerated the decline of malls
   * GME's footprint of 5,500+ stores seems like its unsustainable in the long-run - question is can they trim the footprint fast enough to a smaller, more profitable footprint that they will be around in the long-run
* The short squeeze feels like it will be a battle of who has more conviction and a longer time horizon - the hedge funds who are short or the WSB traders who are long
   * I love all of you guys, but I don't have much faith in WSB having more conviction / longer investment horizon than hedge funds (and by longer I mean who is willing to hold their position for a year to see it play out)

I do agree with the members on this sub that you can make money trading GME in the short-term, potentially seeing a rally up - but this is probably not going to be a LT winner

GME is a meme stock. Here's why.,0.82,"Listen the fuck up. If you have a single dime in GME right now you're retarded.

I know for a fact the majority of you are one of the following:

1). Playing with your recently deceased grandpa's inheritance.

2). Illegally trading in your freshman year of highschool using your parent's social security number on Robinhood because some youtube guru memelord said you can make 10k in a day.

3). Using your rent money, child support, or bank loan to gamble on the market because you're an addicted degenerate.

This means you likely play video games, and if you have a functioning brainstem you likely play on PC. But to those of you that don't play on PC let me ask you one fucking question. When is the last time you walked into a gamestop?

CNBC recently released two \~15 minute videos discussing how Gamestop was unlikely to grow, appearing to be unbiased by discussing both upsides and downsides. However, a careful look at their graphics used reveals their true intentions. As you can see, the graphs are **unevenly scaled to make the gains appear smaller than the losses**, with the left graph starting from about 0.5B and ranging to 1.7b, a range of about 1.2b. Meanwhile the right graph starts at 2.75B and goes to 3.5b, a range of only 0.75 billion.

The left graph is scaled to make a 29.7% gain look like it should, about 30%. However, **the right one is scaled to make a 15.8% loss look like a 66% loss. What does this mean?**

It means that **market makers are paying news outlets HARD** to have them release negative news reports. Stay frosty.

Positions: Gamestop calls, strike doesnt matter much but PLEASE do not get short dated calls. We know the squeeze is coming in next few months.

**Recommend 1/15 $12-13 calls.**

Edit 1: 40 million new shorts were opened in the past 2 market days despite float size being only 45 million. This indicates institutional closing of shorts and re-opening at higher prices to drive prices down. Doing this has already cost them a lot of money, and they are desperately praying for it to go down.

Edit 2: We have seen a consistent pattern of spikes like this followed by trading flat or slow decline over the past few months. However, the price always ends up higher than before the spike. The spikes are also increasing in intensity. This is just buildup to the real squeeze. Get your shares or long dated calls ready.

UPDATE 1: [Gamestop.com](https://Gamestop.com) web traffic increased by 10 million visits from the previous month in September. Global, country, and category ranks doubled. People are actually visiting the website directly and buying from Gamestop.

Update 2: Just like with the other spikes, we should expect flat trading or slow decline, but price shouldn't go too far below $11 and should consolidate somewhere around there. If the news breaks this week will be very pleasantly surprised. Expect catalyst to come sometime within the next month.

Update 3: Justin Dopierla just recommended Gamestop and says a short squeeze is likely. He sucessfully predicted Gamestop's rise since $5 and also correctly predicted a Rite Aid stock buy two months before the stock doubled.

For perspective, the analysts featured in the news who don't recommend Gamestop have an average pick success rating of 50%.

Update 4: Went up and consolidated around $12, volume basically nothing. This is our new price until next big news. Moving higher after every spike.",2020-10-10 21:27:23
I have a fresh theory on GME,0.83,"If you study some strategic news releases-Wikileaks is a good example, They break the news up and feed it in over a period of days or weeks to maximize impact and keep it on the front page. 

Several people here and analysts have mentioned that it was weird that GameStop did not lead with details on the revenue sharing agreement...

What if there’s more to the agreement and GameStop and Company plan to trickle that out over the coming days to compound the  pressure on shorts?

If you study some famous short squeezes like Volkswagen or pharma bro that is exactly what they did - space out the pain.

Edit: pretty sure they are spacing out the news. I noticed Cohen bought in late August and upped his stake in late September. Why? Why wait if it was not to keep the news on the front page?",2020-10-10 20:44:08

I don’t quite remember what the post was about, but the first comment I saw was: “Why do I care what spaghetti people think.”.... I thought that comment was so goddamn funny that I decided join this subreddit and lose almost $20k...

Stop with the weekly calls on GME after a run,0.92," This is WSB & no one has time for DD. Let's talk $

Skip the weekly calls. The only thing that seems to be overblown here is the short squeeze play. Guys there is no such thing as a SMALL short squeeze. Please don't mistake every 20%+ run as a squeeze. Please remember that GameStop is trading at a fraction of it's revenue and dare I say a fraction of it's potential so it makes sense that a run to $15 did not trigger a squeeze.

With that being said even after an incredible bull run the short interest has INCREASED from 136% to 141%. (As of 9/30 update)

I believe GameStop was oversold Friday & Microsoft deal was underappreciated not overblown (Involves multi-year revenue sharing). The media has a way to turn positive news into a negative. Please don't fall for it. My confidence has grown in GME's management after recent STRATEGIC moves as well as their ability to turn the company around.

Look for an entry around $10.50-$12.50 after Friday's sell off.

My theory on GME support @11,0.71,"So all who got in before the jump at around $9.30 got their shit upgraded after the halt to $11 instantly. Everyone else at that point jumped on the bandwagon because of the spike which included all the FOMOs. Price was driven up. 

Mom and pop shorters that followed the “smart money” probably got margin called and covered positions yesterday and today which helped drive the price to around just below 15. 

Profit takers and people who bought the top in addition to the millions of short sales that occurred today contributed to the decline we saw. Those people, I believe, mostly made up all those who bought in AFTER the spike to 11. 

Ppl who bought in before the spike most likely are holding their positions unless the price falls below where the spike took them initially which is around 11 bucks. 

So I’d say 11 is a critical level to watch before a lot of people exit their positions driving us down to around pre Microsoft news levels which would be a nice spot to buy back in imo.",2020-10-10 03:08:07

Let’s play a game,0.93,"Amazon weeklies burned me bad about a month back. I had turned 2K into 10K and was flying high. Ready to YOLO into the next NKLA. AMZN came knocking on my door. I couldn’t turn that beautiful bitch down. You know how it goes. Buy a few amazon weeklies, it can turn 10K into 30-40K if you’re right. Well, I wasn’t right. Lost down to 1.5K. I withdrew all but ten dollars.

So, the journey. How far can ten dollars take me? I became obsessed with the idea that someone who has hardly anything can become a millionaire. I’m here to show how retarded I am. At any minute I plan to be completely wiped out. 

My moves so far. Disney 127 call purchased Wednesday for 7 dollars. I sold for 20. I then bought 1 MGM 22 call for 11 and sold for 16. Then I got SPY 349 calls at close yesterday. Two for 14 dollars total. Sold for 22 each this morning. I rolled those into buying 3 GME 10 puts expiring next Friday for 13 a piece. Sold at close for 25 each. My account value is at 72 dollars now. I’m going to see how long I can ride this pony. 

Good luck retards, I’m an idiot and have to buy weeklies, but if you want a challenge, see how far ten bucks takes you. Most likely, you’ll land in the god damn Wendy’s parking lot begging to flip burgers.",2020-10-09 22:28:22
How to not get fucked playing GME,0.89,"For those panicking about GME.  This is normal.  The squeeze didn't trigger today, but that doesn't mean shorts aren't going to have to cover in the coming week, and it doesn't mean the stock isn't going to go back up.  

Take a look at the chart for the past couple of months. [https://i.imgur.com/hiijNL0.png](https://i.imgur.com/hiijNL0.png)  It spikes, then bleeds down, then spikes, then bleeds down.  Yesterday's spike was the largest, so it makes the others look a little less crazy, but there are a lot of 20-30% days in there.  The main thing to notice there though, is that each spike is higher, and each bleed stops at a higher price than the one before.

&#x200B;

Buy FDs and short dated calls at one's own peril.  Take some profits after each spike, buy back in after it drops if you like.  Safest way to do so is via shares, which you can swap back out for calls eventually if you want greater profit exposure.  IV bleed is serious in between runs, but its hard to know when it is going to jump again, so exiting entirely can lead to a lot of regret as I have learned firsthand.

GME will hit $22 within a week,0.82,"Margin calls will be hitting smaller fish tonight and tomorrow.  Will cause those shorts to buy back to close.  Price goes up.  Middle of next week the larger guys get margin calls and some of them need to close large short positions.  If it plays out I see this hitting $22-25 within a week, depending how many diamond hands longs are holding on.  This can peak $50-100 on a squeeze if big holders don’t cash out early.  One more big press release and it’s game over shorts.  

Long 10/16 $18 calls.  Short 10/16 $20 calls.  Paid $10 per spread.  20:1 return if it closes above $20 next Friday.  Break even $18.10.  Good risk reward.",2020-10-08 23:17:12
Why you may want to get into GME now. As in right now. After hours. Even at the top.,0.88,"I've posted 2 times about GME and each time GME has had a massive day the next day. See my post history.

Here's my 3rd attempt. YES, GME climbed a ton today. You'd be an idiot to buy in now. Right? Maybe.

Here's why maybe not.

1. Go here. [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities). GME has been on the list since 9/22. How many days ago is that? 13 market days.
2. Read SEC rules here: [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm). In particular, look at section IV:

*In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out failures to deliver in securities with large and persistent failures to deliver, referred to as “threshold securities,” if the failures to deliver persist for* ***13*** *consecutive settlement days.*[*\[10\]*](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn10) *Threshold securities are equity securities*[*\[11\]*](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn11) *that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency (e.g., National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)); totaling 10,000 shares or more; and equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer's total shares outstanding. As provided in Rule 203 of Regulation SHO, threshold securities are included on a list disseminated by a self-regulatory organization (“SRO”). Although as a result of compliance with Rule 204, generally a participant’s fail to deliver positions will not remain for* ***13*** *consecutive settlement days, if, for whatever reason, a participant of a registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position at a registered clearing agency in a threshold security for* ***13*** *consecutive settlement days, the requirement to close-out such position under Rule 203(b)(3) remains in effect.*

**Now put 1) & 2) together.**

Now decide how much you're willing to lose and look into AH purchases.

**Update 1**: looks like it's drippy today.  This is **great**. Ideally it drops 10% and triggers the uptick rule. I'll be waiting for that.

**Update 2**: Uptick rule in place. Bet what you're willing to lose on calls

GME - It's NOT Over,0.91,"We called it, over and over and over. Many of yall retards missed it today. GME missed the moon and went straight to Mars.

BUT, it's NOT OVER.

* GME's fair value from just cash on hand is $12 (we just scraped it. Edit, we flew past it in the last trading hour to 13.5), not to even factor in MSFT's partnership that'll give it fuel for a long time
* Shorts are gonna get absolutely wrecked. GME went up 40% today. We haven't seen the end of it. I'm predicting something of VW short squeeze proportions (THINK spot price 25+. Who knows, maybe 50+. Why? GME only has a market cap of 300MM. This can easily be pushed into the 1B+ range)

&#x200B;

**The play:**

* Sell cash secured puts while we weather out today. Get premium but now you can get assigned on stock you want to carry through console cycle
* Buy calls when GME cools down back to 11.5 range. Nov and out. Next catalyst is console release

Gaming Bets - Piper survey notes gaming engagement boost among teens,0.78,"New 'FIFA' out this week on PC, consoles

Recap of the stories powering up or beating down video game stocks.

**NEW RELEASES:** This week's major new game release is Electronic Arts' (EA) soccer sim ""FIFA 21,"" out on October 9 for PlayStation 4 (SNE), Xbox One (MSFT), PC, and Nintendo Switch (NTDOY). Also out this week is ""Baldur's Gate 3,"" a role-playing game by Larian Studios. The game rolls out in early access on October 6 on Microsoft Windows, macOS (AAPL), and Google Stadia (GOOG).

**PIPER ENGAGEMENT NOTE:** Piper Sandler analyst Yung Kim said in a research note released earlier that the firm's semiannual survey of over 9,800 students indicated increased video games engagement across the board, with teens playing daily up to 31% versus 26% in the Spring 2020 survey. Kim said that a primary beneficiary was Activision Blizzard (ATVI), as after a summer of staying at home, teens chose ""Call of Duty: Warzone"" as the free-to-play title they play the most at 62%, up from 33% in the previous survey. The analyst sees the data as positive for console publishers Activision, EA, and Take-Two (TTWO), as well as mobile publishers Zynga (ZNGA) and Glu Mobile (GLUU).

**BARRON'S:** Max A. Cherney wrote [in a article for Barron's last week ](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-playstation-5-and-xbox-series-x-are-a-huge-deal-for-gamers-heres-what-it-means-for-investors-51601682443?mod=past_editions)that videogame stocks are expected to get another major boost. For the past six months, nothing has shown up on time but there's one major consumer event proceeding as scheduled next month, namely the launch of new videogame consoles from Microsoft and Sony, Cherney said, noting that pre-orders for the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 sold out in a matter of hours last month, despite their $500 price tags. Shares of Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, and Take-Two Interactive Software are each up at least 24% this year, but if history is any guide, there are more gains to come, the author added. Cherney also noted that the next-generation consoles arrive with games ""atop the entertainment pecking order,"" especially as many movie theaters are closed and Americans are still stuck at home. The author highlighted that, according to IDC, U.S. videogame sales are forecast to rise 19% this year to $45.6B, while the U.S. film box office peaked at $11.9B in 2018 and has grossed just $1.9B in 2020 so far.

**OTHER STORIES TO WATCH:**

* Last Thursday, Blizzard announced that the release date for ""World of Warcraft: Shadowlands,"" the new expansion for the company's acclaimed massively multiplayer online role-playing game, had been delayed, with executive producer John Hight saying that it is ""important"" for the company to ""deliver an experience that meets our highest expectations."" The game was originally slated for a late October launch, but Blizzard said it will instead be out later this year.

How to Play GME,0.82,"Alright retards, you've probably come across like 50 posts on GME. And you get it: short squeeze, something something Burry, console cycle, aight you're sold, right?

The problem is, we've been promised this balls to walls short squeeze for a long time now. But the truth is, no one knows when it's actually going to happen. It feels like it's happening, the beginnings are there at least, with GME up like 50% in the past month. But this is just the tip y'all.

So here's how we play GME.

1. Sell OTM cash secured puts, way way out like Nov 20, $9 strike which you get $150 premium for. Now I know y'all be dumbasses and only know how to buy calls and puts, but the purpose of selling puts is that you collect premium, and if you're ever assigned, then great you get to own some delish cheap GME stocks (at the low price of whatever strike you sold at). If you're not assigned, well also great, you collected some cold hard cash. And while stocks aint as fun as options, they get to participate in all the juicy short squeeze upside.
2. Buy OTM calls, like way out Nov 20 $10 strike. Now I know you retards understand this part. We think stonks go up, especially by Nov with the console cycle.

Now keep in mind buying OTM calls is now way cheaper because you've sold puts. Instead of paying $200/ call contract , now you're collectively paying $50 for this package. If you choose your strikes a little differently you can instead actually net collect a credit. 

You can actually even choose different expirations for your put and call. For instance, sell the Jan $10 put for like 300, buy twice the Nov $10 call for like 150 / each.  This way you don't have to put up any money (although you will have cash tied up in collateral for your cash secured puts). And once again, cuz y'all love GME, you wouldn't mind the low price of $10 for GME stock in Jan.

For the few of you that are still with me, what I've described is basically a **risk reversal (or risk reversal with legs expiring on different dates) .** You've got a fat upside without the cost basis of outrights. And if you want you can also set it up so that you still collect some premium if the stock doesn't move outside the put strike and call strike regions.

Aight thats it. Now lets go to tendie town.",2020-10-05 05:51:25

**Edited Post:**

**Disclaimer:**

**I am retarded and these numbers may not be accurate or up to date.**

Would anyone like to spend some time this weekend adding to the discussion?

So, I think I have been obsessing over GME and this is what I have come up with.

There is also a post about this.

[www.shortsqueeze.com](http://www.shortsqueeze.com/)

Days To Cover (Short Interest Ratio) 10.3

Short Percent of Float 136.03 %

Short % Increase / Decrease 15 %

Short Interest (Shares Short) 66,410,000

Short Interest (Shares Short) - Prior 57,860,000

Shares Float 48,820,000

For anyone wondering:

**Days To Cover:**

“The 'days to cover' represents the total estimated amount of time for all short sellers active in the market with a particular security to buy back the shares that were lent to them by a brokerage.

If a previously lagging stock turns very bullish, the buying action of short sellers can result in extra upward momentum. The higher the 'days to cover', the more pronounced the effect of upward momentum may be, which could result in larger losses for short sellers who are not among the first to close their positions. “

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daystocover.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daystocover.asp)

**Short Percent of Float:**

Now if your looking at that next number that says short percent of float and wondering what that is all about it is the percentage of shares currently short relative to the total number of shares floated. So yes you are reading that correctly and there is a short interest of 136.03%.

[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortexceed50.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortexceed50.asp)

How can this be? How can we have more shares short than are floated?

Which leads me to my next question.

What is naked selling? ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp))

Now if your still paying attention I am hinting at the possibility that naked short selling is happening and everyone is trying to drive this stock to the core of the earth.

Now we can also see that from the source.

[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)

The number of available shares of the past couple of days has risen from 900 to 550,000 and the FEE has steadily decreased, in my opinion that would be the likely result of people trying to unwind their short positions and the borrower trying to incentivise people piling back into the short position.

**I know this is too fucking long but if you want to make money you like to read.**

[https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

GME has been on that list now for a long time and starting next week I believe due to the SEC rules short positions will have to start covering, and these are short positions that were opened sub $7 when the stock is now trading at $9.45. This stock is owned primarily by institutions, people are going to get obliterated by whatever happens here.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/thresholdlist.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/thresholdlist.asp)

As you can see by now I am insinuating that this may be obviously a potential short squeeze situation.

**The Fundamentals:**

This is the stuff that really matters to the retards here.

Go have a look, this stock has like no retail movement right now, why on earth would it ever go up from where its currently at? Why are people investing in it?

Well Ryan Cohen’s interest in the stock brought it back to life due to his association with the E-Commerce giant CHEWY, and Dr. Michael Burry seems to think that this business has some underlying fundamentals that are going to allow it to be profitable in the future.

The business is cashflow rich right now and it easily has enough money to weather it through this next console cycle which historically has been a great revenue booster.

So, GameStop is not dying, they are closing stores and reducing operating costs they have an E-Commerce guru and an autistic genius both invested.

**What is the catalyst you ask?**

Well it could be any of these things:

\- GME call a vote would require board members to call back their shares.

\- GME announce a buyback again.

\- Activist investor such as [Patrick M. Byrne – Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_M._Byrne)

\- Burry or Cohen could increase their stake.

\- Shorts could be forced to cover due to SEC Violations (SHO)

\- Strong positive earnings due to console cycle

\- Autistic sentiment

Take your pick.

Now I am invested for 1360 shares. That is my position.

Ryan Cohen is not an investor, he is an executive with experience building a company to dominate its local market. GameStop is such a company with dominance in this market. He is looking to replicate his Chewy success here. Why else would he be going into a board negotiation with a mergers attorney?

**Chewy and GameStop**

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2020/01/26/ryan-cohen-started-a-company-that-took-on-amazon-and-sold-it-for-3-billion-now-hes-thinking-about-whats-next/#20f4e9825579](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2020/01/26/ryan-cohen-started-a-company-that-took-on-amazon-and-sold-it-for-3-billion-now-hes-thinking-about-whats-next/#20f4e9825579)

From the article linked at the top:

*Since leaving Chewy, Cohen has been looking at investments, both public and private, but hasn't yet seen, or come up with, an idea as good as Chewy.*

*""Sometimes the best strategy is just to be patient and wait for that,"" he said.*

*Now, a decade later, after selling Chewy for 3.35 billion, and exiting the company, Cohen is still thinking about the best way to beat Amazon.*

*It’s harder now, he says, but still possible.*

*And the best idea to bet on could be the one that everyone says can’t possibly succeed.* 

Since GameStop is a Delaware company he only needs to get over 50% in order to force a merger. He is unlikely to get over 50%, however, seeing as the number of funds holding GameStop currently is very high. 

(see [https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=GME&subView=institutional](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=GME&subView=institutional)) 

Cohen’s best course of action is to negotiate with GameStop’s Board of Directors and agree on a price to be presented for a vote to shareholders. This action would also probably force this squeeze, because institutions would call in shares for voting. This may even fund Cohen’s entire purchase of GameStop. 

Imagine if Cohen successfully negotiates an offer, then Blackrock and Vanguard will have to call in their shares, starting this squeeze in earnest.",2020-10-01 03:29:38
GME YOLO month-end update — Sep 2020,0.97,,2020-09-30 20:32:49
Why Gamestop Might Squeeze But Virgin Galactic Won't,0.95,"Hello, retards! Today we're going to learn about short squeezes. Shorts are gay bears who borrow stock to sell it, under the mistaken impression that stocks can go down. There are two ways that short sellers lose money. The first is the simple and obvious one. If the stock goes up, the retard who shorted it might have to buy it back at a higher price than he sold it, incurring a loss. The second way is the borrow rate. Obviously brokers and banks only let people like us trade so they can steal our money. One way they steal our money is by having the audacity to charge interest on borrowed shares.

Now, the key here is that as more shares are shorted and it's harder to borrow new shares to sell short, the *borrow rate rises*. It can rise very, very quickly. Since we're all poor and have no access to real data, we'll use iborrowdesk.com to get a sense of the borrow rates. While the rate on iborrow might not be accurate for all market participants and brokers, it should go up and down with the average borrow rate across the market.

Gamestop is showing as a 39% borrow rate, with 15,000 shares available to short.

Virgin Galactic is showing at a 3% borrow rate, with hundreds of thousands of shares available to short.

What this tells us is that the gay bears are paying very little money to short Virgin Virgin, but are paying out the fucking nose to short Chad Gamestop. As the share price of both stocks rise, the short sellers of Gamestop will be taking a *considerably* heavier loss, especially if the borrow rate stays elevated.

If the S3 article is correct and the true short of float percent is 57.3% that is still the second highest in the entire market. No way to tell if the buy volume is covering or true buying, but according to iborrowdesk there’s only 20,000 shares available to short. The mother of squeezes is on the horizon, and there’s no shares available to keep it down. 

You can say reeeeeee blockbuster or place your bets now, because they can’t keep this down indefinitely, especially once regSHO forced closing starts. For the love of god don’t do weeklies. 10/16 or January 21 $10-11 calls will print.",2020-09-29 14:21:45
Reg SHO list update,0.87,"After a few days of research I’ve come up with more information on the workings of this. If any information is in accurate or misunderstood on my part feel free to to correct me; I am by no means an expert. 

As I have come to understand, a security will make the list after failing to deliver shares for a position. Time starts ticking day one, and at day T+3 it makes the list if the dollar value of the position meets the threshold established by the SEC. This is most often associated with opening short positions, as the shares for the short position must be borrowed to be sold. 

HOWEVER from what I’ve managed to gather; the position is allowed to be opened and it becomes the brokers responsibility to then find shares to borrow after the fact. They do not need to be available at the time of the order being opened. This is where a stock making the list comes into play. After 13 days however, any positions opened that still have not had shares located to fulfill the brokers obligation MUST be closed, and the must be bought from from the open market. 

Now as I originally started my research into this to make my decision for GME, I will use that as an example. They made the list the 22nd. That would make the original date of failure to deliver the 16th. So if my understanding is correct, and it may not be 100%, the 29th would start the forced closing of all positions which have not had sufficient amounts of shares located for borrow. 

Aside from my original purpose of researching this, it seems this list would be a powerful tool to find possible squeeze candidates. Critique and further in depth explanation welcome. This is not financial advice, flame away whatever I don’t give a fuck. Happy hunting autismo’s",2020-09-26 19:51:10

**Call to Action – Buy shares and callas asap. GME is already up 6% today. Let’s stick it to the big money Market Makers and make them have the biggest short squeeze in history.**

&#x200B;

DD- Here is the short of it – Market Makers can sell short securities that they don’t even own or are able to borrow. This is called Naked Short Selling and is technically illegal except under some very narrow circumstances. What happens later is they are then unable to deliver these securities at settlement date and have a very short window to buy and deliver these securities. The expectation is that the Market Makers will buy these shares at a better price and can make additional money.

I looked at the data available [https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) and found that on 8/25 when there was a huge up day there were 347k shares that resulted in Failure to Deliver.  20200825|36467W109|GME|347372|GAMESTOP CORP (HLDG CO) CL A|4.87

Hello, I have seen a lot of posts about GameStop in the past few weeks and at first I thought it was retarded that anyone believed GameStop would go up in price. I believed GameStop was a dying company and that nothing was going to save it on its tumble towards bankruptcy and liquidation. I still pretty much believe that, but after doing lots of DD, I have somehow convinced myself that regardless of the actual prospects and future business plans of GameStop, its stock price will moon in the coming months/quarters.

There have already been many posts with DD on GameStop telling you to buy/sell shares and various options. They all contain a lot of different info on GameStop. I'm not making this post to tell you exactly what play to make, I think you can make money betting on and against any stock if your timing is right. Instead, in this post I'm going to accumulate and layout as much relevant information that I can on GameStop and possible bull/bear scenarios in the coming months. I am biased towards a bullish case, but I will try to remain as neutral as I can, meaning I won't misrepresent or lie about any data to make GameStop look any better or worse than it is. I will also source all numbers.

**Timeline:**

This is a timeline of possible events and catalysts relating to GameStop.

3-xx-2021 | Q4 Earnings Report | Includes sales of new Consoles, could be a huge catalyst and or run-up causing squeeze.


**Short Positions:**

We all know about GameStop being heavily shorted, everyone who has looked into GameStop knows this, but this is a big factor when taking into account possible future price movement regardless of it being known and repeated, so I will get this out of the way first. GameStop is the most shorted stock out there in terms of short percentage of float. [The current short percentage of float of GameStop is at 118%.](https://www.highshortinterest.com/) How is this calculated? 

This is the shares short [\(57,860,000 shares\)](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) divided by the float [\(48,880,000 shares\)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME) * 100 = 118.37 short percentage of float. This is insane to say the least.

This essentially shows what we all know, that there are more shares sold short than there are available shares to be bought back. We can consider a few conclusions from this information:

-The first obvious conclusion is that GameStop has a huge potential for a short squeeze depending on what price shorts initiated at and what the fee is on these shorts.

-GameStop is such a failure that everyone thinks it will go bankrupt and there will be no short squeeze. Also, there is a lot of pressure on the stock to drop in price by institutions as well as short sellers.

Next, we have to look at how many shares are available to borrow and at what fee rates. [Here we can see that GameStop has around 700k shares available to be borrowed at a fee of around 42%.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) We can also see that fees jumped heavily from 4% to around 30.5% somewhere between August 31st and September 8th. I'm not sure exactly why this is considering there are around 700k shares available to borrow, but regardless we can see that it's extremely expensive to borrow GameStop shares right now.

Lastly, we have to look at what price shorts entered into their position at to understand critical prices of GameStop in the case of a short squeeze. [From this chart](https://media.ycharts.com/charts/26eacba7e8557e5574bb895fe73c74c5.png) [\(Source\)](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/09/most-shorted-stock-in-the-market-gme.aspx):

We can see over half of all short positions entered their position around July 2019. The stock has generally been under $6.50 from then until recently. This is huge, assuming the stock hits $13-$15 there will be a large amount of margin calls/forced closures of the position, further increasing stock price and causing a short squeeze.

Summary:

From this data we can see that given a few catalysts, the stock price can rapidly rise causing a short squeeze. However, there is a lot of money and pressure on the stock price to stay low. This pressure has temporarily been released because of the high borrowing fees, but could continue if fees lower again. This is also dependent on wider market sentiment, as a crash like that of April/March could destroy any short squeeze.

**Finances/Balance Sheet:**

A lot of shorts are betting on GameStop going to 0, however this is very unlikely, as GameStop has enough cash and liquidity to keep going for now. Granted, their last quarter's report was fundamentally garbage as always and as expected, [but on page 3 you can see they greatly increased their cash and cash equivalents](http://news.gamestop.com/static-files/2d565e82-f8b2-432f-a13c-2c0a3e9aaeff), this was done by a [note exchange offer between GameStop and their creditors.](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-expiration-and-final-results-exchange-offer). Also, on page 4 of their 10-Q, you can see that they greatly decreased their net loss from last year's 2Q report. Lastly, you can see that they halved their merchandise inventories a whopping $474,000,000. As a result, GameStop though it may be failing, will not be failing anytime soon.

**Digital Growth:**
An important aspect of GameStop is that it's biggest growing sector is digital sales. [In Q1 of 2020, GameStop's e-commerce sales increased 519%.](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-first-quarter-results) [In Q2 of 2020, GameStop's e-commerce sales increased by 800%.](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-second-quarter-results-and-strong-progress). This shows that their shift to digital has been exponentially growing and is finally starting to compete with other digital retailers. This ties into the next section.

**Activist Investors:**

There are two notable investors in GameStop right now. The first one, who has been in GameStop for a while, is Michael Burry. Yes, the guy from the big short (which I still have not seen). He is kind of a meme and I don't really see what he brings to GameStop other than just being the dude from the big short, and trying to profit off of what he sees as a value play. [Regardless, he owns about 2.75 million shares of GameStop according to his company's last filing.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761920015233/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml)

The big activist Investor that recently entered GameStop as mentioned above is [Ryan Cohen, founder of Chewy, which he sold for $3.35 billion dollars.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/04/chewy-co-founder-ryan-cohen-this-is-the-side-hustle-id-start-now.html#:~:text=In%202011%20at%20age%2025,to%20PetSmart%20for%20%243.35%20billion.) Chewy competes with Amazon in regards to pet products, and is now valued around $22-23 billion. Ryan Cohen has said [in an interview with Forbes:](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2020/01/26/ryan-cohen-started-a-company-that-took-on-amazon-and-sold-it-for-3-billion-now-hes-thinking-about-whats-next/#19cae9d85579)

“I look at almost everything that comes to me, but I say no to 99.9% of it. That was true at Chewy too in terms of just programming all of our executives that generally the best answer is no. As Warren Buffet says, the difference between successful and really successful people is really successful people say no all the time.”.

[Ryan Cohen has bought a 10% stake in GameStop.](http://news.gamestop.com/static-files/c23ec4d5-65b1-4c27-826f-b2f701599bbb) The fact that Ryan Cohen, who created a company that successfully competes with Amazon in e-commerce, bought a 10% stake in GameStop, which as shown above is exponentially growing it's digital presence, is extremely bullish to me. I believe Ryan Cohen taking a more active role in the company would be a great catalyst on the stock price.

**Upcoming Console Sales**

The new console cycle could be a huge catalyst. [Previous cycles caused the stock to moon in price.](https://i.imgur.com/71bDQXu.png) Of course, this time may be different due to the vast channels that the hardware can now be distributed through. Overall, it's another potential catalyst.

**Possible Bull Scenarios:**

There are many possible scenarios in which a bull run can occur in the next few quarters. One of the most important factors unrelated to GameStop is that the market overall must resist a crash like that of March.

Overall the catalysts are:

-Crazy high short positions, possibly leading to a crazy short squeeze.

-Finances ensure GameStop can keep going for many more quarters, while they restructure the business to focus on digital sales and other sectors.

-Digital growth is insane and shows that they can begin to compete with other online game retailers.

-Ryan Cohen is now taking interest in GameStop, and he is an expert when it comes to providing a quality online retailing experience for customers. Him taking a position on the board or more ownership of shares are potential catalysts for a short squeeze.

**Possible Bear Scenarios:**

I believe that the default position of GameStop is bearish long term. I don't see them getting back to their former glory days via digital sales.

If none of the catalysts work to cause a short squeeze, then we will see GameStop stagnate again and eventually go to 0. In the case that a catalyst causes a short squeeze, after the short squeeze I would buy long term puts. I believe that the bullish short squeeze potential is a better risk reward play than buying puts.

**My Play:**

Essentially, I do not care about how GameStop fares longer term. I just see a lot of things aligning up that could lead to a huge increase in the stock price of GameStop. As a result, I have convinced myself to throw $20k on it. I can see the stock price hitting $20 or $25 in the best case scenario of a squeeze. If I missed any important information please let me know, I'll add it here.",2020-09-25 13:33:48
"GME short squeeze incoming, last chance to jump ship at the dip",0.89,"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gme - 118 fucking % of float shorted on a company that survived long enough to have a decent amount of profit (thanks for the new console cycle). Wait for the short squeeze to happen soon, 50$ is highly probable. 

For those of you retards who don't know what short squeeze means: normally if you want to short a stock you borrow it (for a fee) and sell to buy back at lower price and make bank. But what happens if the price goes up against you? You not only have to pay the borrow fee as time passes, you also can get margin called and have to close position and buy back the shares at higher prices. Which drives price higher. Which makes more shorters be margin called and buy back shares. Rinse and repeat and watch the price fly to the fucking moon


**Short interest** is 57.8m shares according to http://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/GME.htm

**Total float:** 45.53m


I believe this is the last change to hop in on the dip. GME is down today to sub-10 levels, but is rising back again as I write it so anyone who wants a golden ticket to the fucking moon - come on in.

Failure to deliver threshold list,0.87,"Looking for some clarification here. I’ve done some research, but I’m still a little lost. 

GME was added to the failure to deliver threshold list this morning, likely for incredible amount of short selling. I’ve gleaned a very basic understanding from google. 

If someone could explain the nitty gritty Barney style that’d be great. Otherwise the big question is does this mean short positions are about to be force closed by dealers?

**I. INTRODUCTION**

* When I look at the sentiment surrounding GameStop, it doesn’t take very long to see [comments]( https://i.imgur.com/lndA70O.png) [like](https://i.imgur.com/Ec4z1fx.png) [these](https://i.imgur.com/6WoeXUS.png), yet here we [are](https://i.imgur.com/NpANVzR.png). What’s going on? Are people that stupid? Just jumping on the new console cycle? Idiots not pulling their gains and going to zero? When even r/wsb thinks the stock is a dud, it must be right? Nearly 120% short interest, yet the stock is up nearly 40% this week. 
* Its no secret GameStop has been hurting. The secular shift to digital has been pressuring them for some time with their highest margin category - used video software – under significant distress. Each year their gross margins contract with net income in the red these past few quarters. Everybody has written them off as the easiest short in the world, however I'm going to try to explain whats going on and tell you that buying GameStop may not be as bad as you think.

**II. CONSOLES**

* Just to start things off, you have to remember we’re in the beginnings of the new console cycle. But what does that even mean? Well the advent of new consoles means new trade-ins, new product, new customers, and a fresh spike in GameStop’s popularity. Sales have stagnated the years prior, and they are all but certain to go up and remain elevated for the next 1-2 years. Note that against all counts, the company was actually profitable during the 2019 holiday season, with new consoles you can bet that they will annihilate all expectations and proceed into 4-8 more positive quarters off the cyclic shift. This is pretty unanimous, and everyone accepts that they will start reporting positive going forward. In fact, new console cycles are where GME has historically [spiked](https://i.imgur.com/LOehh3E.png).

**III. POST CONSOLE CYCLE**

* At this point, the focus turns to what happens once the hype dies down. Digital will continue to erode upon physical, but the key factor here is that physical is not actually dying off. [Its not](https://i.imgur.com/kmVPF39.png) [going to](https://i.imgur.com/rfRRGC9.png) zero. **The biggest reason physical is sequentially a lower percentage of the market is because the total market size is increasing.** Digital is shooting off while physical is largely stagnant. Note that physical games admittedly have their strengths. Not only are they structurally cheaper because you can resell them, they also have clear definitions of ownership and the collectability factor where you *need* to have a physical copy you can hold. In fact, [two thirds](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/320224/Analyst_66_of_console_players_still_prefer_physical_games_over_digital.php) of console video game players prefer physical vs digital.
* While physical is here to stay, albeit at a weaker level, that isn’t enough to turn the tides for GameStop. You see, GameStop knows digital is the trend and here to stay, they are not fighting it, **they are moving along the secular shift**. GameStop sells [digital games](https://i.imgur.com/RZJGjFE.png). GameStop is set to release a mobile app combining Game Informer and a online storefront by [month end](https://i.imgur.com/rdXejYc.png). They are doubling down on their online store with +500% ecommerce growth in [Q1]( http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-first-quarter-results) and +800% growth in [Q2](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-second-quarter-results-and-strong-progress). Expanding into numerous other [categories](https://i.imgur.com/QSkZEAw.png). Nearly 70% of their online orders were fulfilled on the same [day](https://i.imgur.com/NK8lkqD.png) leveraging their wide network of stores, of which they are pruning the excess. Also, Game prices are set to [increase $10](https://technosports.co.in/2020/09/19/sony-confirms-that-ps5-games-will-cost-up-to-69-99/). 
* GameStop’s Loyalty Program accounts for over 55M [users](http://news.gamestop.com/fact-sheet-0). They intend on leveraging this network though a [company branded credit card](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-now-taking-pre-orders-sony-playstationr5-and-sony) with spending rewards to grab market share and retain customers. Furthermore, a digital revenue sharing model continues to [grow](https://i.imgur.com/V94FWJC.png) as publishers understand the value of GameStop as a customer acquisition service and that keeping the company afloat is better for sales and the general video game industry. (*[See the fall of Toys R us and its impact on Mattel/Hasbro](https://www.retaildive.com/news/the-toy-category-still-hasnt-recovered-from-the-death-of-toys-r-us/571701/); turns out the manufacturers really needed ToysRUs*)

**VI. BALANCE SHEET**

* But wait, their financials must be shit right? They have to be losing money. How much longer can they last? 
* Well it turns out their books are rock solid. They offered their creditors a new set of terms to push back debt for 2 years, 50% of them [took it](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-expiration-and-final-results-exchange-offer). They have eliminated all excess goodwill impairments. They are in a [$300M net cash position](https://i.imgur.com/HhfHaIT.png) with significantly reduced inventory (which explains the sharp reduction in Q1/2 sales) and massively cut SG&A by 28% in preparation for the console cycle. [FCF KING](https://i.imgur.com/LYyrrUm.png)
* Many believe the days of their strong margins are long gone, but in fact its only beginning. You have to remember, digital is only outpacing NEW physical games. [Retro games](https://thenextweb.com/gaming/2019/02/01/retro-consoles-video-game-sales-nostalgia/) are a [huge untapped market](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/01/talking_point_how_much_is_your_video_game_collection_really_worth_to_you) where GameStop can replicate their past success, and it is a category digital can never penetrate. [Jesus wtf.](https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nes/little-samson) GameStop is looking into [these already](https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/retro-gaming/pre-owned)

**V. MAJOR BACKING**

* In fact, their ecommerce prospects are so promising, Ryan Cohen bought a [10% stake](https://investorplace.com/2020/08/gamestop-news-sends-gme-stock-soaring/). This guy took on Amazon and [won](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2020/01/26/ryan-cohen-started-a-company-that-took-on-amazon-and-sold-it-for-3-billion-now-hes-thinking-about-whats-next/#7cdf60865579). [Jefferies](https://i.imgur.com/Duyxu1i.png) and [Telsey](https://i.imgur.com/K169L1N.png), wall street firms, came out with strong buy ratings citing company prospects. [Michael Burry](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/michael-burry-top-portfolio-holdings-massive-bet-alphabet-google-scion-2020-8-1029517864#) still holds a 5% stake. This guy took on Wall Street and won. [Half their creditors](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-expiration-and-final-results-exchange-offer) ($200M worth) believe in GameStop’s prospects. Why would they defer their debt unless they believed the company will be in a paying position by 2023?

**VI. THE SHORTS**

* But here is the real kicker. GameStop’s short float. 120% has never been seen before. The short theory was that GameStop would not make it to the new console cycle and the shorters would collect their tendies. But GameStop made it. Current short fees are like 60% and from some figures we can draw on, we estimate that around 70% of the shorts got in [under $7](https://i.imgur.com/wRaMbLx.png), GameStop is currently nearing $10. **70% of the shorts are underwater.** Even if you don’t believe that any of their initiatives will work you have to admit that the company will be able to continue operating for another two years off the new console hype alone. When the stock hits roughly $15, we can expect to see several margin calls trigger a fucking massive short squeeze. For reference, [Blue Apron](https://i.imgur.com/6EqU417.png), [Volkswagen](https://i.imgur.com/S3DHn3j.gif).

**VII. CONCLUSION**

* Just the fact GME got to the new console cycle must be making the shorts cry. Add on that they’ve been making serious progress towards online and mobile presence, aligning themselves with industry trends, operating in a growing market, potential monopoly in the untapped retro market, solid financials, beginning their new upward cyclic cycle; you have the makings of a powerful ecommerce storefront just leaning into their growth period. Even post console hype, they should be able to leverage their branded credit card to retain a huge number of customers and bite off huge market share off other retailers. Lastly, remember that despite the trend towards digital, its in the gaming industry's best interest to keep GameStop going strong. The likelihood of additional revenue sharing agreements are fairly high.
* For comparison GameStop has a P/S ratio 0.11. Chewy has a P/S ratio of 3.6. If GME begins to grow their revenue from this point its valuation will begin to normalize. Even a P/S of 0.2 would mean a stock price of ~$16, 0.4 would mean $32. The company is going to ride the console hype and likely trigger more than a few margin calls along the way. Everything management has been doing is to ride the new cycle into a fluid ecommerce business model, and everything I'm seeing suggests its going to work.

Cry For Help,0.59,"Alright the Friday before Labor Day I took big hit in the market correction and have been bleeding ever since. Mind you Im new to trading. I've been looking on here and a few other subs (all over the web really) and was taking direct advice and quickly learned - stop that shit.  There's a lot of just ""fun"" on here or whatever and I need no filler, no nonsense news/ tips/ hints. So after learning and adjusting from my loss/es I've learned a few things and this is kind of where I'm at mentally:

* I have to stop panicking and leaving good positions when they go slightly against me and let them play out- if I did proper DD.
* Because I have a small account I have to look for trades that will at least play out positively for at least one trading day because I can't exit positions intraday freely as if I'm day trading.
* Stick to quality, reputable companies.
* I will say even though Im against just following whats posted here this sub does have a knack for mentioning stocks that will move big and keeping a constant flow of key news whether it's breaking last minute news or an event a few weeks out so I'm learning to stay tuned in but play the moments based on my own thoughts.

And that's about it, I don't really know technical analysis and I think that's killing me. I researched MACD, RSI, SMA/ EMA & Bollinger Bands but they're not on RH as futures like on Webull or ToS so I don't use them much. I've been entering stocks late in the pump/moon and catching the ride down, I also lost big playing earnings for either GME or SWBI. I still think earnings are good opportunities I just don't know how to read the situations properly.

Also should I stick with Robinhood or switch brokers. I like it just wish the charting had more features and the 9:30 -10:00 time area were better with filling orders.

That's where I'm at mentally. I think I should take 4- 6 weeks off based off my losses and just learn  and take another stab at it. I was starting to make money but the Labor Day correction shook things up for me.

Any advice, any books I should read, series' I should watch... I'm open to it all, I'm serious about trying to succeed in the market so I'm not giving up but I've lost enough that I'm getting more realistic and learning to respect the ups and downs of the market. I gotta really come up with a game plan to do this.

FOR RETAIL EYES ONLY. NO MM'S ALLOWED. DD on GME,0.87,"Ok, we should be safe in here guys. Since that article, we now know the MM's are creeping wsb for retail info. I dont want them to know a retailers DD on GME. Lets dive in.

Nobody should buy this stock. Its terrible. Going to zero! Im shorting! Big debt, negative EPS. Dont get caught holding the GME bag.

However,

There is a *RISK* the share price could *DOUBLE* before going to zero as the new console cycle will bring lots of FCF to the stores.  We now know that physical game disks will still be in high demand as the digital only console specs are much weaker and have restricted backwards compatibility compared to the disk version console. This will give GME a big boost to revenue when it comes to trade-ins, where their profit margins are highest.

\- They have heavily reduced their SG&A, closing unprofitable stores, restructured debt so they can continue without worry until 2023 if they cant manage to turn things around. Their y/y comps from 2020 -> 2021 should show a huge improvement which the market has not priced in.

\- Recently the chewy founder has taken a 10% stake in GME as they look to transform themselves into an e-commerce business model, launching a new app and possibly turning stores into semi-fulfillment centers/ in store gaming hubs in the near future.

\- The management team has done stock buybacks to reduce outstanding shares from >100M to 65million making the SP more volatile to the upside if MC improves.

\- If GME was to have a market cap of 1Billion which is still quite low (prior console cycle saw GME mrkt cap at +$4b) the share price would need to be $15.

\- Short interest is >100%, so a potential short squeeze would bring us huge *LOSSES*

Dont let the MM's know that the SP could *DOUBLE* in the medium term. They might use that info against our *retail short position*

Ok *RETAILS*, here is our position

Buy puts of any strike at least 2 months out or just short sell. Just don't tell the MM's or they might take the other side of this position.",2020-09-15 19:22:38

There's some funky things going on with Gamestop (GME), a.k.a. the blockbuster of video games.

1. Short fee > 30% and rising
2. Short availability <200K shares and falling
3. The selloff the last week in GME was largely correlated with overall market selloff. IF there's a rebound this week, possible to see rebound in GME as well.

If the stock pops any more than it did today, there may be a lot of people rushing to cover their very expensive shorts.

**Update 4:** The short fee has increased to >38%, with 0 shares available to short. **GME is over 100% shorted now!**

**Update 7:** Still holding/adding. **Short fee now at 64%.** I'm speculating, but **imagine paying 64% annual interest to short the stock while it goes up 30% in 2 days.**

**Update 8:** Buying every dip (major red candle at 2:30 on 9/17)

**Update 11:** Day of reckoning for my 9/18 holdings. Still holding as of 7:00 a.m.

**Update 12:** Still holding. Added more 9cs when they went to .2 on the dip. **Anyone who wants FDs - 9/18's 9cs are trading at intrinsic value.**

**Update 15:** Like I said in update 8, buy the 2:30 dip.

**Update 16:** Fuck RH. They auto-sold my ITM calls. Bought back in on IBKR.

**Update 17:** Final update for the week. Up $24K on calls/shares, but a lot of OTM calls expired worthless. Hope you did well. I'm going into the weekend holding $65K worth of shares and about $8K worth of 9/25 calls - at strike prices from 6, 7, 7.5, 8, 9, 10, 11. Not going further up than that for now. Lost a good chunk of profits from not knowing RH's auto-sell process (first month using RH). 

**Update 18.** Still holding / rolling. Buy major dips in the morning. 9/25 10cs were 0.49 the morning of Wed. 

**Update 19** Got out of most of my positions here. Hope you timed things better than me. At my peak I was up $30k, getting out with a net of $15k. 

**Update 9/29** currently holding 4500 shares (added 1500 over the last 24 hours) and a few 9/25 calls. Gradually increasing shares on dips

GME has now been memed and is destined to fail 🐻,0.78,"The GME short squeeze play that’s caught fire in the past week is this week’s PRPL, SLV, whatever. It won’t work, retails are not smarter than MMS and hedgies, that’s why they’re retail. Your calls will expire worthless, save your money for something worthwhile, like donations to your wife’s boyfriend’s girlfriend’s OnlyFans.

Earnings will underwhelm, “guidance” will be flat, and there will be no bombshell announcement. EOW will fall into the low $5s, EOY might slowly creep back to $7-$8 range with console cycle excitement, during which time shorts will slowly unwind at their leisure, because GME will have basically found its bottom and their capital is better deployed elsewhere.

IF there was a shot a lot an “epic” short squeeze, it was when the RC investment was announced. That 70% pop, that’s all you get. I’d love to be wrong so retails could “stick” it to the big guys, but it’s rigged.

GME YOLO month-start update — Sep 1 2020,0.98,,2020-09-01 20:05:35
GME short squeeze,0.85,"This is for all of you who think GME is the next Blockbuster because games are going digital (that's why no one buys physical gift cards anymore, right?). The same geniuses throwing money at [companies with no revenue](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NKLA), [colors](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PRPL), and [companies whose competitors are giving out their products for free](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZM). I'm going to tell you why everyone is buying it and why /u/DeepFuckingValue is going to be a multi-millionaire soon.

## Short squeeze
**GME is one of the most shorted stocks**: 55M of 65M shares are short, including [>100% of float](https://www.highshortinterest.com/). Based on average volume, it would take the over 15 days for all shorts to cover. More than half the shorts entered under $7 and are now taking losses. **A price spike from good news could trigger a [short squeeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_squeeze) and force shorts to cover at higher and higher prices**. If only there were good news...

## Enter Ryan Cohen
In 2011, Ryan started competing with Amazon, Wal-Mart, and Costco to sell a commodity. Despite [historic failures by predecessors](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/dotcom-pets-dot-com.asp), he thought he could prevail by focusing on customer service. He ended up selling [his company](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CHWY) for $3B, and now it is worth $27B. Since then, Ryan has been very selective about investments, saying no to [99.9% of opportunities](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2020/01/26/ryan-cohen-started-a-company-that-took-on-amazon-and-sold-it-for-3-billion-now-hes-thinking-about-whats-next/#63e0b2d25579) and investing only in AAPL, WFC, and... GME?!?

**Last Friday, Ryan filed a [13D](http://news.gamestop.com/node/18181/html) indicating he bought a 9% stake in GME.** The [updated filing](https://newsfilter.io/a/6b966651795e12f76f45b301d8227a7f) shows that he bought 415K shares yesterday, including 100K at $6.726, and now owns a 9.6% stake. He might continue buying, but we won't know until after Q2 earnings next Wednesday. Since the filing, GME is up ~40% and [short borrowing costs have increased from 3.9% to 8.5%](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME).

But why would he get into GameStop? People are as fanatical about games as they are about pets. He doesn't have to build a company from scratch - he can take the Chewy focus on customer service and Chewify GameStop. He is also joined by James Symancyk, former CEO of PetSmart, who is on the boards of both PetSmart and GameStop.

**Ryan's addition changes the whole trajectory of the company**, no longer with terminal value 0. Don't forget GameStop owns [ThinkGeek](https://www.gamestop.com/toys-collectibles/thinkgeek) and has been shifting into toys and collectibles. But even within games there is an upcoming catalyst...

## New console cycle
New hardware is not very profitable for Gamestop, but resales are. A new console cycle means that people will get rid of old consoles via trade-ins, which Gamestop can then sell at healthy margins.

Ryan Cohen is long GME, Michael Burry is long CME, and even [the guy who bashes GameStop on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf1Wt2HEllOSeQzKz2-GNDA) is [long GME](https://stocktwits.com/message/240323066). GME is still trading below book value. Get in while you can.

¿GME Puts,0.7,"It seems like GameStop is becoming obsolete. They have over 5000 stores which are mostly in malls in America and i dont know if youve ever been in one but in my opinion it sort of feels like a yard sale. They’re just flipping used games and used consoles for cheap.

People don’t really buy disks for games anymore, and online game companies are growing and selling more games exponentially. 

GameStop will continue to sell used consoles, but they wont be able to sell (overpriced) games for them and as newer consoles get developed they will have fewer things to sell at all.

I can also personally attest to the fact that you can get cheaper used consoles from amazon or other online sources. I bought an xbox one for 85 dollars that actually works pretty well. 

I loved going into GameStop as a kid, but the simple truth is that the world really doesn’t need them anymore.

A wee bit DD on The new PS5 and how it affects SNE and Gamestop,0.72,"Looks like majority of people will opt for the disc version of the PS5. This will help prolong GME’s life cycle. In past console releases, GME’s stock typically peaked in the November around the launch of the console. If things go well, the stock could be a 10x between now and Xmas. But it’s only a small position for me. I own Oct $10 calls.

Stop pretending Hedge Funds and Big Banks aren't made of retards.,0.95,"Just try to remember how stupid some of the people in your college econ classes were. Now remind yourself a bunch of those people work for big hedge funds and big banks because of daddy's connections and the truly worthless go raise funds for charities or something. A guy I know works for JPMorgan and he could be mostly aptly described as a rock eater (well take any anecdotal evidence with a grain of salt but I'm sure I'm not the only one to know a glue sniffer who works on Wall St.)

Some single individuals like Michael Burry (who's now bathing in his pre pump WYNN/LVS/FL calls) are able to beat the market consistently but those people are so fucking rare they generally can't overcome the mass of retards that usually compose the rest of their funds or bank (even then they can be wrong, hello GME). These people represent 0.00001% of institutional investors and most of the time the money they move is not enough to get things going

And that truth is reflected when it's put under the microscope:

'' From January 1994 to October 2018 – through both bull and bear markets – the passive [S&P 500 Index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp) outperformed every major hedge fund strategy by about 2.25 percent in annualized return ''

So stop worrying about ''the rug getting pulled'' in these times because they can't pull the rug on their own. We gotta pull it with them too. We saw that when even big Daddy Buff got out earned by mental retards for 2 months straight. He sure as fuck didn't want to tank that 20% loss on purpose. So stop worrying so much about how ''big money'' is gonna fuck us and enjoy the ride of the most roller-coaster market of our lifetimes.

* $570 Million in Cash
* Q2 Projections of $575 - $625 Million
* $419 Million in debt ( 2021 Maturity )  has been resolved with a new debt exchange offer ( 2023 Maturity ) aka no risk of bankruptcy
* Market Cap 300 Million ( approx. **1/2 book value** )

**Who buys expensive video games in a Recession? Everyone.**

* The previous record for video game sales was set in March 2008 ( 1.8 Billion ) with the [March 2020 figures coming in at  ( 1.6 Billion )](https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/2020/first-quarter-2020-sales-of-us-video-games-boosted-by-strong-march-performance-according-to-the-npd-group/) with [April raking in ( 1.5 Billion )](https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1263816799721631745)
* This illustrates a demand for video games, not only in a recession, but also in a quarantine/stay at home environment
* PS5 was just revealed Thursday 6/11 - and the New Xbox is set to debut soon as well.

&#x200B;

**""Console Cycles"" and Their Effect on Price**

[Heres a look at 2013 and the release of the Xbox One and PS4.](https://imgur.com/tK3AEol)

* The hype/pricing in begins End of May and Continues right up until the console releases ( Oct/Nov )
* GME back in 2013 was booming, and definitely not priced at less than half of its book value.
* This years pop should outpace its previous 80% gain in 2013

&#x200B;

**Digital Consoles making GME Irrelevant**

* Digital games cannot be gifted. Think of a kids bday party - these mf's are getting nothing but $65 games left and right. Physical ones obviously.
* Digital Copies take up space on hard drives, creating the need for more storage, and slowing performance.
* Physical games are considered collectibles by a large  % of the gaming population

&#x200B;

**Gaming Industry needs and wants a healthy GameStop**

* Some try to make the argument that SNE/MSFT/Nintendo would rather sell direct and that GME is just the ""Middleman""
* GME is the worlds largest **Video Game Only** retailer. SNE/MSFT/Nintendo see them as a valuable asset to distribute their products to a loyal, and long standing audience.
* If GME were to go tits up, SNE/MSFT/Nintendo would have to negotiate with big box retailers such as TGT, AMZN, BBY who are not solely dedicated to Video Games. Resulting in decrease margins.
* GME is actually testing ""digital revenue sharing"" with the 3 large producers, although they havent outlined what the details of this is - its easy to see theyre working together.

I'm talking about the company everyone loves to hate, GameStop. I'm pretty new to trading, so I don't have the DD skills of someone who has been here for years, but I do know video games as I collect them pretty heavily.

**Research?**  

I sell as well, and I have noticed an insane uptick in costs of games, eBay and local sites have been flooded in the past 2 months with people buying games, as such prices have risen tremendously. Well, do I have any data to back that up? Fuck yes I do, I created a shitty python file about 6 months ago that tracked the prices of games for a given day for about 25 consoles. You can find that here: https://github.com/Cokeroft/pricecharting

The important jist is in the prices folder, find any console you want and look at some prices from pre covid and now. Most notable increases are in Wii, N64, and Gamecube those have been flying off the shelves. If you are able to run it, feel free but you can use the get_any_csv.py file and you can compare, I've done that and here are some examples (CIB) from 120 days ago:

Animal Crossing City Folk $9.99 -> $27.51  
Super Mario Galaxy $11.57 -> $18.91  
Super Paper Mario $10 -> $19.83  
Zelda Skyward Sword $23.77 -> $38.37

These are the prices for 120 days ago, now if you compare to 10~ days ago, when states starting reopening... prices are now stagnant or decreasing. Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 both dropped 7% in the last 10 days, and most other titles did the same. I'm think we are leaving the apex of used game buying from people on eBay and other sites to endure this pandemic. The states are reopening and people will soon be looking to get out of these purchases.

$GME no longer reports used games sales, but the last time they did they had a 42.7% gross margin on used game sales vs the 23% gross margin on new video games. I would wager it's still around there, maybe closer to 40% because they have gotten a lot of exclusive licenses the last few years. Anyways, I think in the next couple of weeks/months we are going to see a very large influx of people trying to get rid of these games and consoles, and as I said they are more inclined to bring to gamestop than a mom and pop game store. The barrier of entry in eBay pushes a lot of people away (as an eBay seller I hear this all the time) and these people are going to consider the loss worth it because they got their entertainment out of it during the pandemic. So Gamestop will offer them 10% of what they paid, and they will take it because they give zero fucks.

Unfortunately, I do not track volume of sales I perhaps should do that in the future. But I can attest to the volume actually increasing, and these are out of print games, these are just leaving hands of consumers to consumers. I've also been to several game stores in the last month and they almost all are low on inventory. Games of note do not last more than a day, and even random shit ones are popping in price.

**Positions / Ideas**  
Since this is currently about to happen, and Gamestop is a fucking dumpster fire of a company, I'm not looking for any options for this year. The earliest I would take is the 1/15/21 $5c. I think there is pretty good upside there and it's really the only one with decent volume, even though the IV is trash. I'm personally going to wait to see if it drops more in the next week or two, and snatch a handful.

Anyone maybe more technical able to see if there is anything here? I'm basing this solely on the fact that used game trade ins are going to spike dramatically, which will in turn make their inventory increase and sales would come (as long as Gamestop is still in business by then). I don't have anything in regards to them actually selling the games, so maybe that will shoot this in the foot. Anyways looking for some ideas on how retarded I have become",2020-05-27 03:07:51
Gamestop Earnings 5/28,0.54,"Pros:

A) Insider buying.  Note the Accounting officer who resigned is not on the list.

&#x200B;

D) People stuck inside quarantine are playing and buying video games.

E) GME was running sales from their online portal and allowed pickups of orders from their stores (only pickups no entry to buy).

F)  In late 2019, Michael Burry’s hedge fund bought 3% of **GME.** In fact, it’s his largest position in the fund, allocating 17.3% in **GME.**   He continues to be a bull.

G)  GameStop said it has been able to reduce debt by $401 million under its ""Reboot"" strategic initiative, which is aimed at optimizing the core business. It also claimed to have exited 2019 with about $500 million in cash and to have cut down selling, general and administrative expenses by $130.4 million.

Cons:

A) You can buy video games at so many places now - Target, Walmart, Best Buy, digital downloads from the publisher, etc. 

EDIT:This includes publisher platforms like Steam, GOG, XBox store, PSN, Nintendo store, Epic games, even Green man gaming.

B)   Hestia Capital Partners LP and Permit Capital are activist investors and fighting to put their own board picks for the annual meeting schedule on 6/12/20.  GME has responded by sending out letters to their shareholders urging them to vote for their own picks.  Regardless uncertainty continues to be a pressure point for them going ahead.

Reminds me of the HOG (many autist bears like myself got smoked on that trade) activist shareholder battle which was ultimately resolved ahead of earnings.  I don't see GME resolving anything before earnings but it could do so before the June 12 meeting.

C) All of their stores were closed\*( see above) for March and April.  Some may have reopened in states that lift ed restrictions but foot traffic is probably low.

D) Accounting officer resigned recently (claimed it was for personal reasons) but people are skeptical.

E) IV is ridiculously high for options. even same week like this week options.  Maybe better to play this buying the stock outright and riding it much like bargain shoppers on r/Investing are buying Macy's stock.

BUT the IV for LEAPS is more reasonable ( by GME standards) and there is actually some decent volume on them. See the Jan 21/5c's.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Buy GME LEAP calls. The proxy fight and other uncertainties should be resolved by the next meeting but don't count on it.  Instead buy yourself some time by going all the way out even if u have to sacrifice to Theta gang.

[DD] GME will moon this holiday season due to PS5 Launch,0.57,"If we look at the release of Ps4 in November of 2013 we can see a huge gain in GME's stock price. 

The launch of a major gaming system only comes around every 7 years (PS3 in 2006, PS4 in 2013, PS5 in 2020). 

PS5 will more than likely be available for the 2020 holiday season with mass production starting in June:  [https://www.notebookcheck.net/PlayStation-5-mass-production-to-begin-in-June-with-simultaneous-global-launch-planned-PS5-reveal-event-could-land-in-late-May-or-early-June.462066.0.html](https://www.notebookcheck.net/PlayStation-5-mass-production-to-begin-in-June-with-simultaneous-global-launch-planned-PS5-reveal-event-could-land-in-late-May-or-early-June.462066.0.html) 

According to this bloomberg article ""Sony remains unlikely to delay the launch of the PS5 from the critical year-end shopping season. So long as archrival Microsoft Corp. doesn’t push back the release of its next-generation Xbox, also expected at the end of the year, Sony won’t delay either"" : [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-16/sony-is-said-to-plan-limited-playstation-5-output-in-first-year](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-16/sony-is-said-to-plan-limited-playstation-5-output-in-first-year) 

With Covid potentially affecting this date Jan 2022 $5 calls seem like a safer option - this will give 2 holiday seasons for console sales to increase as some people will get it right on release and then a bunch more the next holiday season (usually when bundles are released at somewhat of a discounted price). With Xbox potentially releasing it's new console around the same time there is no doubt that GME will moon. 

GME is down today good time to get in.

GME insiders are buying and so am I.,0.83,,2020-04-21 15:40:47
"I just bought some GME (Gamestop), and it just might be autistic enough to work",0.87,"After about 4 days of research, I am officially bullish on GME. I have built a position of 470 shares and will buy more Monday. I am feeling confident about this, but I am also an autist and a retard so I wouldn't be surprised if I somehow lose all of my money.

&#x200B;

Anyways, here is my bullish thesis:

1) The undisclosed record date for the proxy fight (which means more institutional share recalls)

2) New consoles incoming for the holidays (confirmed) - Historically, the stock runs for multiple months before the new console cycle begins. This time is going to be extremely explosive due to the extremely negative sentiment and short interest. Not to mention about 50% of consoles are bought physically in stores)

3) Gamer activity globally at unprecedented levels

4) Debt payoff/refinancing news and possibly more share buybacks, mixed in with a clean balance sheet

5) Former Nintendo $NTDOY executive Reggie Fils-Aime joins the board of directors on April 20th. Reggie is known for having saved not only Nintendo, but MTV, and Pizza Hut as well. He is a master of building brands.

6) Hestia Capital and Permit Capital (who collectively own 7.6% of Gamestop) have nominated two candidates with turnaround experience and shareholder perspectives to the board for election to GameStop's Board of Directors.

7) Activist investors have been gobbling up shares recently (Michael Burry, Hestia, Donald Foss, Must Asset Management)

8) The extremely bearish sentiment and short interest due to silly arguments (ex: who buys physical? Isn't Gamestop the new Blockbuster? etc.) has artificially moved the stock down to unprecedented levels.

9) 57 million short positions, more than actual shares outstanding meaning potential for a short squeeze.

10) Gamestop has already begun its brand-rebuilding. They have been remodeling stores into gaming cafes and partnered with nearly every major esports organization in Texas. They announced a multi-year sponsorship deal with Dallas-based Envy Gaming, acquired the naming rights to Complexity gaming's 11,000 square-foot ""Gamestop Performance Center,"" and a partnership with Infinite Esports which will include its OpTic Gaming franchise as well as its Overwatch Team.

\*Note\* Many people believe Michael Burry to be a one-hit-wonder and an autist. However, when he predicted the financial crisis everyone thought he was wrong, and an autist as well. But he turned out to be right. Maybe its a stretch, but just maybe the same situation.

GME Pump after hours,0.86,"Look, I get it. Stonks always go up.

BUT

Gamestop is on its last leg. It had a rally on Monday simply because the literal Big Short Michael Burry bought a shitton of their stocks. It immediately started dropping.

I'm a simple man. I see a company that's literally bound to fail and go out of business within a year or two unless they change shit up, I buy puts.

Why the FUCK is it currently pumping after hours

I fuckin yolo'd my whole portfolio on puts and was up >33% right before market close, and then it pumped and now monday open I'll be taking a green dildo up the ass.

&#x200B;

Hello autists. I've had my fair share of gains and losses these past few months, and I'm not going to predict which fucking way the market is going to go because no number of magical voodoo lines on a chart is going to do fuckall to change the market. I know which way the market is going to go as much as the other guy, and literally everyone on this sub is autistic which is to say nobody fucking knows anything.

&#x200B;

**The Current Situation**

Data, however, doesn't lie. [https://www.crystalbull.com/stock-market-timing/Unemployment-chart/](https://www.crystalbull.com/stock-market-timing/Unemployment-chart/)

This chart shows that in 2008, peak unemployment numbers hit 7 months after the bottom of the market. Same thing in 2002, which had about an 8 month gap between the two. Yes, shit is bad out there. Millions are unemployed, poor people can't pay for food, goods, or rent. But that's the thing: the impoverished of the US are the most affected, AKA the smallest portion of the nation's spending power. Two decades of promoting excess and overspending have conditioned Americans to still shop regardless of their financial condition. Many of you are complaining why the market doesn't affect this. It's because everybody **KNOWS** about the job market going to shit. Everybody **EXPECTS**  bad news. Bad news no longer affects the market, good news will cause violent moves upwards. 

&#x200B;

**The Road to Recovery**

Our economy is straight fucked. But we still have a populace that wants to spend money. To prove my point, cruise bookings are up [40% in the last 50 days](https://www.businessinsider.com/cruise-ship-bookings-are-increasing-for-2021-despite-coronavirus-2020-4) compared to 2019 bookings. In addition, the destruction to the economy is less than some of the apocalpytics here. [This website shows the average expenditures for Americans.](https://www.lexingtonlaw.com/blog/credit-cards/american-spending-habits.html) 84% of expenditures are necessities. That means the majority of US spending is still intact, and with new stimulus packages incoming it will help bolster this line of spending for a bit more (yes I realize the Fed is completely incompetent but the 1,200 stimulus checks will do *some* good). The phased recovery will bolster the economy even more, as services are slowly reinstated. Yes, more houses will be foreclosed, more businesses shuttered, and more jobs lost. But the economy as a whole will stay intact thanks to JPOW's 12 gauge liquidity minigun. 

&#x200B;

**The Stonk Market**

This is what ya'll actually care about. I have no idea where the stock market is going to go, but I can for sure tell you one thing; the initial stock market drop was fairly mild, with rumors driving price action. The massive increase volatility was mainly caused by the double black swan event (namely world pandemic and oil price war) that destroyed liquidity of major players in the market, forcing them to liquidate position to retain cash (this coupled with algos driving price action caused volatility to spike to 85-levels).  

But liquidity is back. MM's have all the cash they need to survive in this environment, and everyone is on prepared for another downwards spiral.  I see many posts talking about how ""unemployment numbers will drive markets down"" or ""reinfection will drive markets down"". Everybody and their mother knows about the potential for another shutdown, and shit is already priced in. While I'm not disputing the possibility of another downturn, it will not nearly be as violent because the catalysts contributing to high volatility in the initial drop are no longer there (liquidity crisis, unexpected). Everybody expects another downturn, and the fact that it's expected will make investors much more level headed about making trading decisions during a downturn. Short term plays still exist but you'll have to be relying on pure luck to make those plays. If you want consistent gains, LEAPS on stocks at their current bottoms such as CCL, RTX, and bigger bank stocks are great picks and potential 10-baggers in the next few months. Keep cash on hand and don't get burnt by theta by making stupid short term plays. A 10 bagger 3 months down the line is still better than zero next week. 

&#x200B;

**Longer TL;DR: Catalysts for a sharp market downturn are gone, any drop will be slow. The stock market is not indicative of the current economy, but rather the more hopeful future. Don't let theta gang fuck you, make long plays for fat tendies.**",2020-04-17 02:36:05

GME YOLO update following the start of the Big Short Squeeze,0.97,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p1vjv3scous41.png?width=2144&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae7eca15ecc1c1017570fb77cfb695cfe6dc6f1c",2020-04-14 21:20:55
GME option trades leading to net stock to buy,0.82,"Seems like  all of today's GME options activity has caused a net of like 420,000 shares to buy so far. See around 8.8 million shares on the tape, so around 5% of that is from option market makers hedging. 

Interesting that options players are net making bullish bets on stock  even after a 20% plus rally.",2020-04-14 16:13:40
What the actual fuck is going on with GME,0.92,"Am I an idiot or what? I thought gamestop, the ""essential business"", would be doing anything but RISING right now, but over the past week it's gone up 70%. WTF is going on here? Not even interested in investing in it, just have no clue what it's doing",2020-04-14 13:49:48
Will GME finally die due to the Rona?,0.69,"People have been wondering how GME can still be alive for a while now. Certainly an already struggling retail cant very well survive the blow of being closed for a while right?

Their stock price has barely even taken a hit from the recent market... actually it's up big pre market. 

At open puts are going to go dirt cheap. 

I'm thinking about it that's for sure.",2020-04-14 13:07:42
GME Options to Print,0.9,"Caught a post from a fellow member here yesterday regarding this mess with GME. Did a bit of my own digging on them and there seems to be something to the idea that the stock is going to have a near term pop due to this proxy battle. Zacks even had a little run down back on 4/3 about IV spiking on the 7/17 $8 *puts*. [(Zacks)](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/852683/implied-volatility-surging-for-gamestop-gme-stock-options)

As one commenter on the WSB post suggested, the $10c 7/17 seemed most attractive. Dove in for 50 of them near the end of close 4/13 at a cost basis of $0.186/contract. 

Regardless of GameStop’s long term future, the short term indicates a chance at printing a big stack of cash if you can snag some contracts before IV takes hold again when this monster pops and the short squeeze really gets rolling.",2020-04-14 10:10:05
GameStop (GME) - THE BIGGEST SHORT SQUEEZE OF YOUR ENTIRE LIFE,0.76,"I'm here today to shill you Gamestop (GME). I won't lose your time with a TLDR long thesis just a few key points why this is the biggest gainer of your life. Here is fuel for the thrusters:

1. GME has 65.5 million shares in total and 55 million shares are short. You read that right. 84% OF SHARES ARE SHORT. Michael Burry owns 3.5 million shares long. Look up proxy war.
2. History points that console releases are where they make the most money and the stock increases on average 120%+.
3. Gaming consumption is estimated to be up 75%.
4. Games have increased memory sizes and the console hard drives can't handle them which may cause a flow back to the consumption of disk games.

GAMESTOP IS A STEAL. TRADING UP 20% ON THE DAY AND IT WILL BE AT 10$ BY MONTHS END.

Buy your calls and the stock far OTM it doesn't really matter. This is a tendies printer.

THE THRUSTERS ARE LOADING

&#x200B;

EDIT: IF YOU ARE LONG MAKE SURE TO CALL IN YOUR SHARES FROM YOUR BROKER AND MAKE SURE THEY AREN'T BEING SHORT-LENT (CALL YOUR BROKERS)",2020-04-13 15:39:47

Boston authorities shut down GameStop and stores close statewide,0.97,"""State and local authorities in Massachusetts have ordered all GameStops there to close, ending a weeklong standoff in which the games retailer insisted it was an essential business and continued to serve customers with curbside pickups.""

What are the chances GME makes it until the end of this?

GME is about to get hit hard,0.73,"So for the eight of you with half of a brain cell, you’ve probably already heard GameStop is in financial trouble. Absolutely no one, other than the employees, will shed a tear if/when they fail. They’re facing dwindling physical game sales, the rise of amazon selling consoles and controllers that delivered to your house, and they had almost 1,000 stores shut down along with their business license suspended in Pennsylvania, which is sad for the eight people that live there (no, not the same eight people as the “half of a brain cell” people mentioned earlier.)

Plus, while everyone else had stock prices raised, GME went down, and I saw my previous manager, Keith, sneeze into his hand and touch a game box. Fuck you keith, I hope you stub your toe until it gets arthritis.

$SPY Fibonacci Retracements and Future Outlook,0.92,"Hey autists, I wanted to drop some quick insight into this newfound uptrend and how we can (semi) reliably predict moves in the market. 

Someone linked a 5 minute youtube video on Fibonacci Retracements, and let me tell ya, I now know just about all there is to know about them. TL;DW: There are key ""support"" levels that can be used to time reversals in market direction and determine if a swing is going to be a longer-lasting trend or not.

To start with, look at [Mar 4 to Mar 10](https://imgur.com/LCFxkZs). Note the drop from 100% to 0% and the retracement (where it goes back up) to 38.2% (one of the support levels!) before dropping back down. 

[Mar 10 to Mar 14](https://imgur.com/D9EbXQq), same thing. 100 to 0, then back to 38.2 before dropping down (Green candle with long wic), then pushing through each support all the way up to 61.8% before dropping back down. 

[Mar 14 to Mar 20/21](https://imgur.com/4VcXnWI), we see the reversal from the previous uptrend, and then the market bumping on the support levels back down on the way to 0%. Note when drawing your fibonaccis that you can use an unfinished dip to try and time the bottom (I think, idfk)! 

[Mar 20 to Mar 26](https://imgur.com/nBKfb4v) we see the reversal breaking through support levels without much bounce, which strongly indicates a new upward trend.

Looking at [Mar 4 through Today](https://imgur.com/Hjb11yu) we can see that we had resistance at the 23.6% level, the 38.2% level, and have bumped against the 50% level twice, or close to it. 

How can we use this information to be forward looking? Looking at some of these price points, we can say that if $SPY gets above $265.40, it should be able to rise up into the $275 range without a lot of resistance. Conversely, since we haven't broken that 50% support level, this could be about as high as it goes before reversing and heading back down again. 

Do with it what you will, I just thought it was neat and wanted to share!

This was battle field triage - it kept the system from going off the cliff but the market and the stonks didn't hit bottoms till March of 2009... 

[use this ms paint abomination as a reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fou79i/bear_reassurance_post/) for the 2008 - the OP is a tard with his paint skills and overall process - the scales of the charts aren't even correct. 

Lots of bounces in between but the line goes down. 

$2T is the new $700B - but the line will still go down. 

Diamond Hands - the next 3-5 weeks there isn't much good news that will come as we are paying for inaction last week and this week. Easter is a bullshit pipe dream if you read anyone with credible medical experiences in the area of viruses

*****

> * Dow futures saw wild swings Wednesday between strong gains and modest losses. Investors overnight had been encouraged by the White House and Senate reaching a deal on a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average logged its best session since 1933, soaring over 2,112 points or nearly 11.4% in anticipation of the relief bill. Despite Tuesday’s gains, the Dow remained about 30% below last month’s record highs.

*****

> * Boeing shares jumped over 11% in the premarket after Reuters reported that plane-maker plans to restart production on its grounded 737 Max fleet by May. The Senate bill, the final details of which have not been released, has money set aside to “stabilize key national industries,” according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

*****

> * McConnell, just after 1:30 a.m. ET, announced the stimulus bill agreement, and said senators will vote and pass it later Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican promised the bill would help struggling industries and rush financial assistance to Americans through direct checks to households, enhanced unemployment insurance, hundreds of billions of loans in emergency loans to small businesses, and more resources for hospitals and medical equipment. Anything passed by the GOP-controlled Senate must be reconciled with the Democratic-controlled House, which drafted its own plan.

*****

> * Despite medical community warnings about the continuing threat of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants to open the economy back up by Easter Sunday, which is less than three weeks away on April 12. Trump said he offered the holiday as a deadline because Easter is “very special” to him. The president added, “I’m not sure that’s going to be the day ... [but] that would be a beautiful thing.” He stressed that any the decision to reopen the economy will be “based on hard facts and data” and will be “grounded solely in the health, safety and well-being of our citizens.”

*****

> * U.S. coronavirus cases have soared in recent days, as testing kits have become more available. According to Johns Hopkins University, America has more than 55,200 cases, the third most of any country in the world, with 802 deaths. Italy’s more than 69,100 cases are second only China’s over 81,600 cases. However, Italy’s death toll of 6,820 is more than double that of China, where the outbreak started in December. Global cases increased to about 428,400 with 19,119 deaths and over 109,400 recoveries. Spain, Germany and France are also emerging as hot-spots in Europe. In Britain, Prince Charles’ household announced that the heir to the throne has tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.

*****

> * Target, one of the retailers that’s seen a surge in shoppers, said Wednesday it’s scaling back plans to remodel hundreds of stores, postponing openings of new stores and delaying the addition of fresh groceries and beer to curbside pickup. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer will focus on a singular mission: providing food, medicine and other essential items during the pandemic. Target is also withdrawing its guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year because of the unpredictable business climate. People have been flocking to Target, Walmart, Costco and Amazon, stocking up in case of prolonged supply chain disruptions.

*****

> * U.S. stock futures hit their 5% “limit up” levels Tuesday as top Senate and White House officials neared a $2 trillion deal to rescue the economy from the coronavirus crisis. The exchange-traded fund that tracks the Dow, which has no curbs, was up just over 5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 582 points or 3.1% on Monday after the Senate failed for a second time in less than 24 hours to advance the stimulus bill. Investors were more concerned about talks on Capitol Hill than encouraged by the Federal Reserve’s announcement Monday of an open-ended asset purchase program. As of Monday’s close, the lowest since November 2016, the Dow was down 37% from its record highs last month.

*****

> * Senate Democrats expressed optimism about reaching a relief deal from the coronavirus crisis after negotiations with Trump administration officials stretched late into the night. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said talks were set to resume Tuesday morning. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi came out with House Democrats’ $2.5 trillion bill. Also on Monday, President Donald Trump suggested he wants to urge businesses to reopen, sooner rather than later. “I’m not looking at months,” the president said.

*****

> * As Trump considers relaxing some coronavirus restrictions, the U.K. issued a stay-at-home order, starting Tuesday, allowing only essential trips. All nonessential public buildings and places are closed, ranging from libraries to churches, outdoor gyms and playgrounds. All social events including weddings and baptisms are also prohibited. In China, the two-month lockdown of most of Hubei province was lifted. However, Wuhan, the city in the province where the coronavirus originated in December, remains locked down until April 8.

*****

> * Global coronavirus cases approached 384,000 with 16,594 deaths and nearly 102,000 recoveries, according to Johns Hopkins University data. China, at about 81,500 cases, has just 21% of the infections around the world as the spread in European nations and the United States continued to spike higher. Italy, the hardest-hit country outside China, saw cases rise to nearly 64,000. The death toll in Italy of 6,077 was nearly double that of China and the highest in the world. Cases in America increased to 46,450 with 593 deaths. Nearly half the U.S. cases and the highest U.S. death toll of 188 were in New York state.

*****

> * Top U.S. airlines are working on plans for a possible voluntary shutdown of nearly all U.S. passenger flights, industry and federal officials told The Wall Street Journal. The government was also talking about ordering such a move, the Journal said. The carriers and the White House have made no final decisions.Demand for air travel has plummeted as many states have issued formal stay-at-home orders or just encouraged people not to leave their homes. Social-distancing has become the new way of life as the world grapples with containing the coronavirus pandemic.

> * U.S. stock futures turned strongly positive Monday morning after the Federal Reserve pledged asset purchases with no limit to support markets. Dow futures hit their 5% “limit down” overnight, and were off 600-points at one stage Monday morning, as a massive coronavirus funding package failed a key Senate procedural vote Sunday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tanked another 900 points or 4.5% on Friday, bringing the weekly decline to over 17% for the worst week since the 2008 financial crisis. Ahead of Monday’s session, the Dow was off more than 35% from last month’s record highs. The New York Stock Exchange’s trading floor will be close starting Monday. The NYSE will go to fully electronic trading. The 10-year Treasury yield, which popped back above 1% last week, was below that level early Monday.

*****

> * Top-level White House and congressional negotiators burned the midnight oil over the now-nearly $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package. Democrats blocked the bill in Sunday’s vote, saying it did too much to bail out companies and not enough to help workers. Several GOP senators, including Rand Paul, who tested positive for the coronavirus, were not present to vote. Others, such as Mitt Romney, were in quarantine as a precaution. The Federal Reserve and Treasury are working on financing programs that could be worth $4 trillion. Goldman Sachs upgraded shares of Boeing, which is hoping for a bailout.

More than half the U.S. cases are in New York, where the death toll increased to 153. Washington state has the second-most cases, with nearly 2,000 confirmed and 95 deaths. New Jersey, California and Illinois round out the top five states. President Donald Trump on Sunday activated the National Guard in New York, Washington state and California in order to combat the spread of the coronavirus. New York plans to run a clinical trial, beginning Tuesday, of a treatment regimen of antimalarial hydroxychloroquine and antibiotic azithromycin, a drug cocktail that has shown promise in fighting the coronavirus.

“Illinois and New York state joined California on Friday in ordering all residents to stay in their homes unless they have vital reasons to go out, restricting the movement of more than 70 million Americans in the most sweeping measures undertaken yet in the U.S. to contain the coronavirus.” ([https://apnews.com/52f7fc77cce85060ad1cf73297b7cd45](https://apnews.com/52f7fc77cce85060ad1cf73297b7cd45))

“When the damage the coronavirus inflicts on the U.S. jobs market becomes clearer, it could be unlike anything the country has ever seen.

Judging by numerous forecasts from economists, the avalanche of furloughs will easily break the record for most in a single month.” ([https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/the-upcoming-job-losses-will-be-unlike-anything-the-us-has-ever-seen.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/the-upcoming-job-losses-will-be-unlike-anything-the-us-has-ever-seen.html))

Italian deaths (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/)  
 

TLDR; 70 Million Americans are on lockdown. COVID-19 is spreading in the US faster than it did in Italy. Italian deaths/day are still increasing. State jobs reports are coming out this Thursday and based on unemployment claims it’s going to be terrible.  
 

Analysis: Longer interval momentum indicators are still decidedly bearish however KDJ on all intervals is decidedly oversold. MACD on 1D is also converging slightly. KDJ convergences and Net Volume convergences are indicating early signs of a bull-trap. Although in the week ahead bearish positions are still justifiable positions longer term are exposed to too much risk to justify. Possible 2% gap down or more on Monday. Keep watching futures and news to confirm. Look for short/put entries EOW or early in the next week if bull trap is confirmed. Major resistance around 260 would be the ideal entry.

Corporate Bond Defaults are coming,0.95,"I understand this will be going above your autistic heads, but try to learn to read for just 5 minutes here.

Your 11 year bull market that thrived on low interest rates, and low unemployment encouraged a lot of big dick financial risk taking behavior by large corporations who similar to us kept saying ""Can't go tits up."" This in turn led to a corporate debt bubble that was highlighted as ""Risky"" by the federal reserves November 2019 financial stability report.

>Business debt levels are high compared with either business assets or GDP, with the riskiest firms accounting for most of the increase in debt in recent years.

When companies rack up large amounts of debt, they sell them to cucks as Corporate Bonds. This is known as the corporate bond market. Cucks who own corporate bonds make money by being paid in interest on those bonds.

But what happens when you have a global pandemic where businesses are forced to shut down for an undermined amount of time? Revenue streams dry up and those companies are now at risk of being unable to pay out the interest payments to the bond holders. This results in a default. Once a company defaults creditors set out on horses with massive dildos to fuck the life out of these companies and force them into bankruptcy. Usually by selling off all their assets to pay back the bond holders and creditors.

There are corporate bond ETF's that you can buy puts on, and that's probably what I'll put most of my money into. The corporate bond ETFs below are the ones I was able to find with the most Volume and OI.

* $HYG
* $LQD
* $JNK

Believe it or not, fucking $GME GameStop has issued corporate bonds GUH! and $ALGT allegiant travel has some floating around too. I believe those two companies are to high risk of defaulting given the current conditions.

I read a post by a leverage banker on here yesterday that said the defaults are going to start soon, so I believe this upcoming week would be a good time to get into your positions.

\-Good Luck Retards.

EDIT** Just for extra insight below is the post by the leverage finance banker who actually has experience in this industry.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 23rd, 2020.

# **Another harrowing week looms for markets as US economy shuts down and virus spreads  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/another-harrowing-week-looms-for-markets-as-us-economy-shuts-down-and-virus-spreads.html)**
*****
> Markets face more violent swings in the coming week as investors watch out for a rising number of coronavirus cases and new data that could show how the virus is slamming the U.S. economy.
*****
> The past week was brutal for stock investors with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting a 17.3% decline, its worst week since October 2008. But it was the stressed-out credit markets that were at the vortex of pain with a standstill in corporate paper and spreads widening in all areas, from corporates to mortgages.
*****
> As economists looked for an even sharper economic downturn from the impact of social distancing, the Federal Reserve in the past week continued to fire away with new programs and liquidity to grease the wheels of nervous markets. By Friday, the dollar stopped its surge, and the Treasury market was a little calmer, with the benchmark 10-year yields sliding under 1% after a wild ride higher earlier in the week.
*****
> “The Fed is buying about $70 billion in off-the-run Treasurys today. That brings their total purchases this week to $300 billion,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital, on Friday. ”$160 billion was the highest we saw in any week during the financial crisis.”
*****
> # Sharp recession
> In the week ahead, there is fresh data on manufacturing and the service sector when Markit releases its flash Purchasing Manager Indexes for manufacturing and services on Tuesday.
*****
> Consumer sentiment will be important when it is released Friday, but the big tell for the economy will be unemployment claims on Thursday, which are expected to show the impact of massive layoffs at restaurants, stores and other businesses that were forced to close or reduce activity to prevent the spread of the virus.
*****
> Claims rose by 33% in the past week to 281,000, an unprecedented jump outside of times of natural disasters like hurricanes. Some strategists say the claims could easily jump to 1 million or more.
*****
> “We’re going to start to see the magnitude of the coronavirus impact on the economy. We already started to see some of it in the weekly claims and now we’re going to get a clearer picture,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Arone said he’s watching the PMI data. “This data is going to inform us how bad it could get, give us some guidance, some rough rules of the road. Right now, it’s sell first, ask questions later.”
*****
> Economists increasingly expect a very sharp but quick recession, starting now. Goldman Sachs economists expect a shocking 24% contraction in second quarter gross domestic product after a 6% decline in the first quarter. The economists expect unemployment to shoot up to 9% from 3.5%, but they see a rebound with growth at 12% in the third quarter.
*****
> “I expect that we’ll see abnormal volatility in markets until we begin to see that infection curve flatten, or we see some type of health remedy, vaccine or some solution. I don’t think we’re going to see that in the next few weeks at least,” said Arone. As of Friday, there were about 14,200 cases of the virus in the U.S.
*****
> # More Fed Artillery
> Leary and others believe there is more room for the Fed to expand its arsenal, and that could include corporate debt purchases. Investment grade corporate debt funds and exchange traded funds saw record outflows of nearly $44 billion in the last week, according to Bank of America.
*****
> The Fed has already slashed interest rates to zero, added $1 trillion in daily repo operations, and created facilities to help commercial paper, money markets and municipal debt. The dollar has rocketed higher since March 9, and the Fed also expanded swap lines with other central banks, which helped stop the dollar’s run on Friday.
*****
> As the world’s reserve currency, companies, investors, banks and other institutions worldwide are looking to raise cash and they want it in dollars, the safest, most liquid currency. That rapid move to cash put a strain on the foreign exchange market, and sent the dollar higher and other currencies sharply lower.
*****
> “I think the market is going to be looking for indications that there’s some sort of stabilization, or maybe even a hint of stabilization and that policy makers are taking the right action. I think we’re not yet at that cathartic moment of peak pessimism,” said Ben Randol, foreign exchange strategist at Bank of America. “I’m watching what’s going to happen over the weekend because some pretty big numbers [of new virus cases] could come out, not just in the U.S. but in other countries.”
*****
> # ‘Liquidity infinity’
> Strategists say it would not be surprising to see more Fed policy moves next week, and a big fiscal stimulus package is expected to come up in Congress on Monday, to ease the impact of job losses on individuals and help companies weather the downturn.
*****
> John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets, said the bond market responded to the Fed’s actions to make more dollars available, seeming to slow the sale of Treasurys by those parties looking to raise cash. “Things are settling into ranges Friday afternoon, because we can’t take it anymore,” he said.
*****
> “The amount of policy thrown at this market was staggering ... Liquidity infiinity is what I’m calling it,” he said. “By the weekend, the whole country is literally going to be shut . You have claims at state unemployment offices skyrocketing. What’s the good news over the weekend? That they’re going to pass this bill? That’s already in the price.”

# How Markets Bottom

> With US equities firmly in a bear market, even the most long-term investors are now looking ahead to when the selling may stop and where the S&P 500 Index might ultimately bottom. “Nobody knows exactly how this market bottom will play out,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, using history as guide, we know markets tend to retest or even slightly break previous lows.”

> We took a look at how markets have bottomed for two previous bear markets that show similarities to the current sell-off, in terms of speed and magnitude. As shown in the chart below, following Black Monday, the largest single-day decline in the history of the S&P 500, the index rebounded modestly, before undercutting its lows about six weeks later. However, a look at the bottom panel shows that the momentum, or speed, of that move was significantly less extreme and markets went on to rally, ultimately eclipsing the 1987 peak less than two years later.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-1.png?ssl=1))**

> The 2008-2009 financial crisis tells a similar story. While the S&P 500 Index didn’t ultimately reach its low until March 2009, most stocks actually bottomed during the fall 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Even though the S&P 500 undercut the October lows by a full 10%, this divergence, similar to the momentum observed in 1987, shows that things were improving under the surface even if the price of the index didn’t yet reflect it.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-2.png?ssl=1))**

> It may be too early to say that the initial leg of our current decline is done, but certainly we have seen extreme fear and a historic decline in markets. One positive—the S&P 500 has yet to close below its December 2018 lows. Soon it may be time to start hunting for signs of a bottom.

*****

# Stocks Approach 2009 Valuations vs. Bonds

> We rolled out our Road to Recovery Playbook at the start of the week to help investors gauge where the market is in its bottoming process. The first and most important piece of that playbook—visibility into a peak in new COVID-19 cases—remains elusive, but we hope to have a clearer picture with the next couple of weeks as containment efforts have more time to work. We continue to monitor cases daily and plan to update you on that progress regularly during this crisis.

> We’re getting closer to checking off the other four boxes. We would just like to see a bit more economic data consistent with recession—almost surely coming soon—and to get more clarity on the timing, size, and nature of the policy response before checking off those two boxes on our list. The technical analysis and sentiment box was checked last week—the amount of bearishness among investors is near the levels of prior bear market lows.

> The last box—markets pricing in recession—was also checked last week based on the magnitude of the sell-off. The nearly 30% drop in the S&P 500 Index from the February 19 high is close to the average peak-to-trough decline in recessions at about 35%.

> Another way to show a recession is priced in and stocks may be near their ultimate bottom is by valuing stocks relative to bonds, sometimes called the equity risk premium (ERP), which we show in the LPL Chart of the Day.

> “Stocks are now historically cheap by most measures after this selloff,” noted LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “When comparing stock valuations to bond yields, we are approaching levels only seen during some of the worst bear markets over the past 50 years.”

> The equity risk premium compares the earnings yield on the S&P 500 (the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio) to the 10-year US Treasury yield. That number as of March 18 was 4.9%, well above the long-term average of 0.8% (it was higher on March 16 when the 10-year Treasury yield was 0.73% rather than 1.18%). That compares to historical peaks between 6 and 7% in 1974 and shortly after the financial crisis.

> The bottom line is that if this trend holds equity investors could be well compensated over time for the risks they are taking now.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ERP-blog-chart-3-19-20-revised-disclosure-v2.png?ssl=1))**

> We know it’s tough to see the other side of this crisis right now, and the volatility is unnerving for all of us. But historically, investors who owned stocks at these valuations have been rewarded over time. We think this time will be no different.

# How Quickly Can Stocks Recover From COVID-19?

> The market volatility continues, as the S&P 500 Index has closed either up or down 4% or more for a record 7 consecutive days. With the S&P 500 Index down 30% from the highs, it has officially moved into a bear market. Yesterday, we took a look at how stocks did after the lows of major corrections formed, and today we’ll take another angle on this.

> We do not know if down 30% is the lows; in fact, it probably isn’t. The good news is we feel we are getting close to a major low. How quickly could stocks regain their February 19 highs? “Historically we’ve found that some of the quickest market sell-offs can lead to some of the fastest recoveries,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “That’s the good news. The bad news is if the economy falls into a recession, it can take longer.”

> As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, there have been 14 previous bear markets since 1950, and it took an average of 20 months from the bear market lows to recover the losses*. Taking this a step further, when the economy avoided a recession, the recovery took only 10 months, versus 30 months for a recession, although a lot of that is because bear markets accompanied by recessions are typically deeper. Last, the last three bear markets that avoided a recession recovered the gains in 3 months, 4 months, and 4 months after the ultimate bear lows were made.

# Looking To The Other Side of The Bear

> The indiscriminate selling continued yesterday, with one of the worst days in stock market history. Fears over the potential impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus) have led to one of the steepest sell-offs in history, rivaling what we saw in 1962 and 1987.

> With the S&P 500 Index down 30% from the all-time highs set less than a month ago on February 19, it is quite clear the stock market is voting on a significant economic slowdown over the coming months. Historically, during bear markets we have found that stocks pulled back 37% on average during a recession and 24% on average if a recession is avoided. With stocks currently down right near the middle of this, the economy could be about a coin flip to going into a recession or not. We discuss this idea and more in our latest LPL Market Signals Podcast.

> What happens next? “Clearly no one knows how bad things could get and when stocks will ultimately bottom, but we feel we are getting close,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The good news is a year after previous market corrections end, as scary as they all felt at the time, stock performance has historically been quite strong, higher more than 90% of the time.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, there have been 31 other 10% corrections or more for the S&P 500, according to data from our friends at Ned Davis Research. We’d like to stress, we don’t know when this weakness will end, but if we are close, the average return after a correction ends has been more than 23% on average and higher more than 90% of the time.

# COVID-19 Collapse vs. Other Major Downturns

> Even though equities rose today, the S&P 500 still remains over 28% off of the 2/19 high. As of yesterday's close, only twenty days after the S&P 500's peak, the index was down nearly 32% from that high. Below is a look at the current selloff from its high versus prior big selloffs since 1928. We all know about the 1929 and 1987 market crashes, but this one has even those beat in terms of the time it took to fall this much. And the two major peaks and subsequent bear markets of the 21st century both took basically a year to fall the same amount that we've fallen in just 20 trading days this time.

# Oil Slippery

> Like a flopping wet fish, it's been incredibly hard to get a hold on an accurate price of crude oil this week. With a gain of 22.2% so far today, WTI is experiencing its largest one-day gain on record (dating back to 1983). The next closest largest one-day gain was in December 2008 when crude rallied 17.8%. While today's gain is impressive, keep in mind that it followed yesterday's decline of 24.4% which ranks as the third-largest one-day decline on record and last week's 24.6% decline on March 9th. In fact, three of the four largest one-day percentage moves in WTI have all come in the last two weeks!

> While a big gain in any asset class always leads to questions over whether it is the start of a new run higher, we would caution that following the prior nine largest one-day gains on record, crude oil's median change over the next week was a decline of 4.4%.

# Russell 2000's Third Largest Drawdown on Record

> While US large cap stocks are right around 30% from their record highs a month ago, the carnage in small caps has been even more severe. While the Russell 2000 never quite made a new high this year along with the broader market, it got pretty close. Like the rest of the market, though, it has been crushed. As of yesterday's close, the Russell 2000 was 43.1% below its all-time high which ranks as the third-largest decline from a record high. The only two periods where the Russell saw a larger decline were in October 2002 when the drawdown reached 46.1% and then in March 2009 when the selling finally stopped at 59.9% on March 9, 2009. Now, if the Russell 2000 were to match either of those prior two periods in terms of magnitude, it would have to fall an additional 4.3% to match the decline of October 2002 or 28.9% to match the decline of March 2009.

# The Buck's Bounce

> In the currency space, the US dollar has certainly not been immune from recent market volatility. The dollar index peaked on February 20th, just one day after the S&P 500 had reached its all time highs. That was the dollar's highest level since April of 2017. Over the following days, the dollar would go on to fall roughly 5% to its low on March 9th. In the time since then, it has more than recovered those losses, rising over 6% and is once again back up to its highest levels since 2017.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-.png))**

> This string of volatility for the greenback is rare. As of today, the dollar is up 4.26% over the past ten days. But just back on the ninth (the recent low) it had been lower by 4.12% over the prior ten days. The last time that there was both a 10-day change up and down of at least 4% in the span of just ten days was back in October of 2008. Going back through the index's history since the early 1970s, there have been a total of 15 days (including that 2008 and current instances) in which such swings can be observed; shown by the red dots in the chart below. Prior to 2008, the only other times the dollar was as volatile by this measure was in the 1980s and late 1970s. So with regards to more recent history, it is even more unprecedented.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-Day-Change.png))**

> In terms of daily changes, the dollar has also been very volatile. Over the past ten days, the currency has averaged a daily change (positive or negative) of just over 1% which is rare going back through history. Again this is the most volatile the dollar has been since the financial crisis, though at that time, the daily swings were larger on average; reaching 1.35% at the high. Prior to 2008, the only other times the average daily change was over 1% was in the early 1990s, mid-1980s, and late 1970s. As with 2008, those past times were slightly more volatile than the current moment.

[DD] $GME the Blockbuster of video games (and murderous douchebags too),0.84,"Why the fuck hasn't GameStop gone out of business yet? They are the Blockbuster of video games.

Why hasn't their stock been destroyed yet??? ""Nobody can go outside, they will play games!"" Great idea but everyone just fucking downloads games because it isn't 1985. And people who don't already have a game system will have one shipped from Amazon or Target on sale.

But maybe GameStop is like Sears and will just refuse to die no matter what happens. That might have been true until [this fucking shit.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-to-keep-retail-stores-open-amid-pandemic-according-to-report-2020-03-19) Literally [every](https://www.polygon.com/2020/3/19/21187309/gamestop-essential-retail-games-coronavirus-shutdown) [gaming](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/359849/GameStop_rules_itself_essential_retail_and_therefore_immune_to_lockdown_closures.php) [website](https://www.destructoid.com/gamestop-refuses-to-comply-with-coronavirus-mandates-to-close-down-583939.phtml) is talking about this.

So after everyone dies from the beer flu and we open up shopping again, people are going to remember GameStop actively killing people for an extra nickel. GameStop already has no reason to exist so let's hold their head under water and put them out of everyone's misery.

**TLDR: Fucking $GME is too shitty to even have options so use the old fashioned method of shorting their stupid stock and enjoy profits from their well-earned demise.**",2020-03-20 01:17:57
GME - GameStop is a dying retailer in a dying market (Kung-Flu),0.59,"Tomorrow (3/20) is going to be the edge of the cliff that is the FEDs last attempt to keep our economy from tanking. But one thing is inevitable, and that is the Kung-Flu AKA Boomer-Doomer AKA Its-Only-Starting. 

GameStop has been getting A LOT of bad rep for their shitty management of the virus. Employees are going to start quitting/striking and its not even like people are going to leave their houses in the next few months to buy a game they can download or ship from amazon.

"We are so early, we haven't hit the real issues the economy will face...",0.85,"What happens when rating agencies start downgrading companies... 

What happens when earnings projections become reality... 

Companies with debt or low cash can handle ""down"" quarters or a recession.... can they handle going from 100-ZERO sales at all for longer then they have ever had to? 

This isn't a store or a region of stores closed from a hurricane or a drop in sales because the company executive was a racist shit on twitter and got them boycotted. 

People are still spending online / stocking up... what happens when you have MASS unemployment the likes of which the modern US has never seen? 

This isn't like the housing crash - it effects EVERYONE.  

How far does 1K get you? You still going to be shipping all sorts of crap to your house from Amazon or are you going to try and save every penny you have so you can keep the lights/gas/heat/AC/on and food on the table another month? 

Here is a middle of the road projections based on this: [Article from WaPo on potential projections](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/coronavirus-forecasts-are-grim-its-going-to-get-worse/2020/03/11/2a177e0a-63b4-11ea-acca-80c22bbee96f_story.html)

Best case was 320 deaths - worst case was 1.635 MILLION... let's split it down the middle

331,000,000 people in the US - let's say 25% get sick - 82,000,000 - let's say only 1% mortality (its 1-3 now but not overly reliable) - that's 820,000 dead Americans 

THAT IS DOUBLE THE MILITARY AND CIVILIAN DEATHS FOR THE US IN WWII

Now - let's say we solve this half way through - that's 400,000 deaths - about equal to WWII - and that's if we handle things right.

GameStop is totally screwed,0.89,"If you haven't noticed, non-critical businesses are closing their doors, sometimes by choice and sometimes by force.  Unfortunately for sweaty neckbeards, GameStop is not a critical business and will soon be forced to shut.

Quarantines are already causing record numbers of people to play videogames, but GameStop is unlikely to benefit due to their business model.  While you can get new releases shipped to you from GameStop, you can get them from any other online store too.  Vintage and used games are sold for a hefty markup in store, but they do not have an efficient method of ordering them online to be delivered. On top of that many services are offering old titles for download, like on the Switch.

When you look at the month for GameStop, they are down only 12%, and the week, only 4%.  Now look at the year: -70%.  They were screwed long before Coronavirus but it will be the death of them, with Reggie or not.

Speculation,0.9,"Right now we're guessing, or maybe, betting is more accurate, that the spread of the Virus would cause more damaging economic effects than are being predicted by the media are talking about. But, we may be betting ahead of the curve.

Prior to the Virus, global GDP was predicted to be 2.9% growth.

[Goldman Sachs](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/economic-recession-forecast-coronavirus-fuel-us-gdp-contraction-market-goldman-2020-3-1028999426) cut its 2020 US GDP growth to 0.4% compared to its 1.2% estimate. [Quarterly](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-healthcare-coronavirus-goldman/goldman-downgrades-u-s-growth-forecast-for-first-quarter-second-quarter-due-to-coronavirus-idUSKBN21217L), they expect the growth forecast for the first (from +0.7% to 0%) and second quarter (from 0% to -5%). Yet, they raised their third (from 1% to 3%) and fourth quarter forecast (from 2.25% to 4%).

[JP Morgan](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/gim/adv/insights/market-insights/weekly-economic-update) actually just comes right out and says it. Recession with two negative quarters in the 2nd and 3rd quarters.

[Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/quarterly-market-outlook) couches their advice in a whole bunch of caveats and no firm numbers. 

WTF, Schwab, put your balls on the table and make a prediction. (Though, I should give them a little bit of leeway since this was the top hit on the Google and I didn’t do any further searching). 

Anyway, the key takeaway from their squishy reporting seems to be your retirement money is safe, because “Historically, stock indexes have tended to return to their previous trajectory within a few months of the peak in global new-case growth.^(1)” 

And see, there’s the rub for me right there. That little footnoted ^(1) above the end of growth. This whole statement is based on the “returns of the MSCI World Index from 01/01/1970 through 2/28/2020, including the following global outbreaks: HIV/AIDS (1981), pneumonic plague (1994), SARS (2003), H5N1 avian flu (2006), dengue fever (2006), H1N1 swine flu (2009), cholera (2010), MERS (2013), Ebola (2014, 2018), measles (2014, 2019) and Zika (2016). Past performance is no guarantee of future results.”

Now, do any of those virus outbreaks resemble what we are facing today? Did any of those viruses actually go viral across the world? I don’t think so.

However, that is the market we’re facing. I still have co-workers thinking this is nothing worse than getting a cold/flu and that this is the bottom and will bounce back in June.

On the other side of that, we have this report from the [National Center for Biotechnology Information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/) in which, if you scroll down to the “economic impacts” (just do a Ctrl-F), they state “The direct fiscal impacts of pandemics generally are small, however, relative to the indirect damage to economic activity and growth.” 

To clarify, the cost of developing the drugs, building hospitals, buying additional ventilators, testing individuals are small compared to the indirect damage.

And even further down it gets worse, “World Bank economic simulations indicate that a severe pandemic could reduce world gross domestic product (GDP) by roughly 5 percent.” 

Let that sink in a little. Goldman is predicting a 0.8% decrease in GDP, and we’re looking down the barrel of a -3.8% GDP (according to World Bank simulations).

They conclude the economic impact section with this statement: “A sustained, severe pandemic on the scale of the 1918 influenza pandemic could cause significant and lasting economic damage.”

So, what’s it all mean, I don’t know, except that it looks bad to me. And, if my experience with the Coronavirus is any indication, it’s going to be bad.  When China actually quarantined a large portion of it’s population, the world markets blew it off, and then a month later we finally feel the effects… The fact that all G7 nations have decided to co-ordinate their efforts to buy their way out of the economic downturn that is coming, it is another indication that there is a bad moon rising.

The Q’s have been resistant to even falling at all, since tech people can work from home. Well, how much can you sell, when people are out of work? SPY has been taking a hit because everyone is worried about a disruption for not more than 2Qs and RUT has been leading the way down, because small businesses are shit.

I thought, like you did, that that little bump up around March 3rd was the bull trap. I now think there is a much bigger bump coming that will be the real bull trap. If we’re truly 2 weeks behind Italy, this was the first day they saw a decrease in the growth rate of infected. So, in order to keep ahead of the market, we’ve got a couple days to make the next trade. Everyone is anticipating that 2 weeks from now we’ll see a decrease in the growth rate of the virus. Which means people are going to be buying. **Sell your puts expiring before, IDK Sept**. 

The trade(s):

Trump himself told us we should be good in July/August. With how quickly the market is moving, I am sure the bull buy programs will go into effect quickly. After all, we know when it will end, so why not stock up before then. Tomorrow may be a battle between bulls/bears. The moment the RUT hits 975, the Q’s hit 156, or SPY hits who the fuck knows, which may be tomorrow, I’m switching from a bear to a bull.

On the other hand, I am looking at a catchup trade for year end after this little bull spurt. Qs to hit 2013 levels (about where RUT will be at the Monthly Moving Average).  So, looking for the most profitable strikes for the Q’s to hit mid 60’s, SPY to hit 160.

Current near expiring positions: SQQQ’s 100 $30CMar20 and 30 $25CJun19, some LVS Jun 35P, CPB $36 May 15P. I also sold 10 CCL 12.50 Puts for 4/17, and have a ton of $5 and 5.50 GME calls, that you can see in my post history (and those gonna climb before Friday). 

Call me out on it and I’ll provide a screenshot, but does it really make sense for someone to tell you what he’s already got, when you want proof where he’s going to go. Seems like a great way to get scammed.

Selling it all tomorrow (except for the GME)",2020-03-17 06:30:13

Once he got the peanut butter off his tongue, and you zipped up your pants, he'd say, ""woof""  (what'd you expect, he's a dog.  Though it really sounds more like slurrp, slrrp, wwof, slrp).

While tossing and turning last night, thinking of my almost all cash position, I decided it was a brilliant idea to buy Mar 20 calls of...  GME.

Yup, I'd convinced myself that Burry himself had foreseen, maybe not the virus, but the economic downturn, and therefore the need for institutions to move dollars shorting a small cap stock into something more profitable.  This would lead to a chain of short covering that would lead to an epic short squeeze surpassing FOSL and possibly reaching VW heights.

Yup, I played 3d chess with myself all night long, and I think both of us were losers.

Thinking $GME calls. Hear me out.,0.92,"I initially wanted to short the company, because fuck GameStop, right?  After some review though, I'm actually thinking that buying calls is the better play for 2020.  I know you're thinking it's retarded, and it probably is, but hear me out.

Thesis:

* Selling has been over-done as it is now trading below book value.  Book value per share \~$9 and market cap is under $300M for a company that made over $7B in revenue over the past 12 months.  Granted, their current business model is dying but bankruptcy doesn't seem likely in the near-term,  like many investors seem to be banking on, especially with the PS5 and Xbox2 consoles being released later this year.  Also, see next bullet.

&#x200B;

* Though Moody's downgraded their debt in January, they upgraded their outlook from negative to stable, citing their good liquidity profile among other things ([Source](https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-GameStops-CFR-to-B2--PR_417805?WT.mc_id=AM%7eWWFob29fRmluYW5jZV9TQl9SYXRpbmcgTmV3c19BbGxfRW5n%7e20200130_PR_417805&yptr=yahoo)).   The fact of the matter is, the company is still relatively stable from a balance sheet perspective.  They still have an opportunity to right the ship if they play their cards right and switch up their business model as they say they are.

&#x200B;

* Short interest over 100%.  High potential for short squeeze.  It would just take one piece of positive news.  For example, if they were to close the poor performing stores, they could report a better than expected same-store sales next earnings.  Don't believe me?  The dumpster fire company Sears' reported increased same-store sales in their 2018 Q3 earnings ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/shoppers-return-to-liquidating-sears-stores-boost-same-store-sales.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain)), which sent the stock price up like 20% if I remember correctly due to the short squeeze.  It was a slightly misleading stat as the company was still destined for bankruptcy at that point, but it was enough for investors to find hope.

&#x200B;

* The company's near-term future is dependent largely on the upcoming PS5 and Xbox2 releases.   
 The company is expecting sales to increase significantly with their releases and I don't think that is priced in yet mostly because neither console has an official release date set yet.  At the moment, both have been confirmed by Sony and Microsoft to be released in time for the holiday 2020 season.  If either company announces an official release date, that should give investors more confidence in GameStops' future sales/earnings and potentially leading to a short squeeze.
   * Supposedly, Sony is said to have an event in March, with press invites potentially going out in late February, that could be when they provide more details and dates ([Source](https://bgr.com/2020/02/04/ps5-release-date-announcement-event-scheduled-for-march/)).

I'm thinking June/July 2020 $4.5 or $5 calls to allow time for news to come out.  I'm not really interested in GameStop long term, but I think it's under-valued at the moment.  Thoughts?",2020-02-18 01:57:42

$GME - Short Bubble,0.84,"Regardless of what you think, GME is here to stay - at least in the short term. But we don't even have to get into the nitty-gritty DD to show this is a quick way to get some tendies.

Gamestop has good numbers - it's currently (as of market close 1/24/20) trading at $4.32, which is .61 P/B with plenty of cash on deck. Yet they are getting annihilated by the market in 2020 (down almost 30% already YTD) - but here's the catch:

GME currently has a 105% short interest, with a short ratio of 10.85. You motherfuckers have literally shorted more shares then are outstanding. At this price and short interest you would think that GME already filed Chapter 8 (even if the financials argue they have a ways to go).

$MIK has bottomed,0.68,"Michaels may be a retail store, but it’s not going anywhere. In fact, it’s expanding. This makes sense because crafts and decorations are the type of thing people like to actually see unlike, say, video games (looking at you $GME). 

I may be the opposite of Michaels target demographic, but I have a positive image of the brand because of how excited my $BECKY gets when she’s in the mood to be artsy or flex on the other $BECKYs that her holiday decorations are better than theirs. 

I’m up already on some 7.50 calls and I’m thinking on going longer on some $10 calls.

Why GME will moon tommorow morning,1.0,,2019-12-11 01:39:26
Just some GME DD,0.85,"It's shorted for good reason. There's plenty of money to be made while GME goes belly up, but it ultimately goes to 0. 

Also, the guidance that we need to wait until the end of 2020 for a console release to possibly turn a profit is garbage. The manufacturers might be keeping disc drive, but the next generation of digital marketing is going to just eat up more business from GME. The CEO of GME speaks of vendor relations. The vendors do not care for GME. They would rather see them out of business. GME have been the leeches of the video game business for years. Now not even the customers want anything to do with them , they want to turn a new leaf? Pleeeease.

Is that why they committed a whopping 0.2% of their stores to take part of a test market of rebooting into hangouts. They will not even share the data on these stores. The business model already exists and they are called gaming cafes. They are dedicated to providing comfortable spaces for gamers and their friends. Their margins are thin and require lots of dedication to be successful. GME doesn't have the wherewithal and will fail miserably.

&#x200B;

Just look at a 5 year chart. GME doesn't exist in 2021. The vendors will just make a better deal with other retailers.",2019-12-11 00:59:18

Thoughts on $GME,0.88,"I just did an online test to prove I am not retarded, so hear me out: 

As all of you probably know $GME will report earnings AMC today.

I've been trying to look into it and see how things are going for $GME. Everyone knows that things are not going well as everyone is buying games online and not on a physical disk anymore. They have contacted a consulting firm and restructured their management team. Now, they are looking to aggressively ""reboot"" Gamestop as they call it.

Everyone is expecting earnings to miss which will likely happen. But, I think it will not be as bad as everyone is thinking. CFO, James Bell, said that they were able to boost sales in early November due to Fortnite. They've also partnered with Activision for the release of the new COD that came out. Furthermore, they are closing stores and were able to cut 4% of their costs last quarter, only expecting them to close more and cut more costs.

The biggest thing in my mind though is that 80% of the stock is shorted making a potential short squeeze on just slightly good guidance possible. I think the risk/reward here is just too good as everyone is $GME expecting to miss and lower guidance, but if they by any chance raise guidance I'm sure the stock will jump 40%.

Let me know what you're thinking my retarded brothers",2019-12-10 11:19:29

# **What Trump does before trade deadline is the ‘wild card’ that will drive markets in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/06/what-trump-does-before-trade-deadline-is-the-wild-card-that-will-drive-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> The Trump administration’s Dec. 15 deadline for new tariffs on China looms large, and while most strategists expect them to be delayed while talks continue, they don’t rule out the unexpected.
*****
> “That’s the biggest thing in the room next week. I don’t think he’s going to raise them. I think they’ll find a reason,” said James Pauslen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. But Paulsen said President Donald Trump’s unpredictable nature makes it really impossible to tell what will happen as the deadline nears.
*****
> “He’s the one off you’re never sure about. It’s not just tariffs. It could be damn near anything,” Paulsen said. “I think he goes out of his way to be a wild card.”
*****
> Just in the past week, Trump said he would put new tariffs on Brazil, Argentina and France. He rattled markets when he said he could wait until after the election for a trade deal with China.
*****
> Once dubbing himself “tariff man,” Trump reminded markets that he sees tariffs as a way of getting what he wants from an opponent, and traders were reminded tariffs may be around for a long time.
*****
> Trade certainly could be the most important event for markets in the week ahead, which also includes a Fed interest rate decision Wednesday and the U.K.’s election that could set the course for Brexit. If there’s no China deal, that could beat up stocks, send Treasury yields lower and send investors into other safe havens.
*****
> When Fed officials meet this week, they are not expected to change interest rates, but they are likely to discuss whether they believe their repo operations to drive liquidity in the short-term funding market are running smoothly, ahead of year end. Economic reports in the coming week include CPI inflation Wednesday, which could be an important input for the Fed.
*****
> Punt, but no deal
> As of Friday, the White House did not appear any closer to striking a deal with China, though officials say talks are going fine. Back in August, Trump said if there is no deal, Dec. 15 is the date for a new wave of tariffs on $156 billion in Chinese goods, including cell phones, toys and lap top computers.
*****
> Dan Clifton, head of policy research at Strategas, said it seems like a low probability there will be a deal in the coming week. “What the market is focused on right now is whether there’s going to be tariffs that to into effect on Dec. 15, or not. It’s being rated pretty binary,” said Clifton. “I think what’s happening here and the actions by China overnight looks like we’re setting up for a kick.”
*****
> China removed some tariffs from U.S. agricultural products Friday, and administration officials have been talking about discussions going fine.
*****
> Clifton said if tariffs are put on hold, it’s unclear for how long. “Those are going to be larger questions that have to be answered. This is really now about politics. Is it a better idea for the president to cut a deal without major structural reforms, or should he walk away? That’s the larger debate that has to happen after Dec. 15,” Clifton said. “I’m getting worried that some in the administration... they’re leaning toward no deal category.”
*****
> Clifton said Trump’s approval rating falls when the trade wars heat up, so that may motivate him to complete the deal with China even if he doesn’t get everything he wants.
*****
> Michael Schumacher, director of rates strategy at Wells Fargo, said his base case is for a trade deal to be signed in the next couple of months, but even so, he said he can’t entirely rule out another outcome. It would make sense for tariffs to be put on hold while talks continue.
*****
> “The tweeter-in-chief controls that one, ” said Schumacher. “That’s anybody’s guess...I wouldn’t be at all surprised if he suspends it for a few weeks. If he doesn’t, that’s a pretty unpleasant result. That’s risk off. That’s pretty clear.”
*****
> Because the next group of tariffs would be on consumer goods, economists fear they could hit the economy through the consumer, the strongest and largest engine behind economic growth.
*****
> Fed ahead
> The Fed has moved to the sidelines and says it is monitoring economic data before deciding its next move. Friday’s strong November jobs report, with 266,000 jobs added, reinforces the Fed’s decision to move to neutral for now.
*****
> So the most important headlines from its meeting this week could be about the repo market, basically the plumbing for the financial system where financial institutions fund themselves. Interest rates in that somewhat obscure market spiked in September. Market pros said the issue was a cash crunch in the short term lending market, made better when the Fed started repo operations.
*****
> The Fed now has multiple operations running over year end, and Schumacher said it has latitude to do more. Strategists expect there to be more pressure on the repo market as banks rein in operations to spruce up their balance sheets at year end.
*****
> “No one is going to come to the Fed and say you did too much in the year-end funding,” said Schumacher. “If repo happens to spike somewhat on one day, the Fed is going to hammer it the next day.”
*****
> Paulsen said the markets will be attuned to this week’s inflation numbers. Consumer inflation, the CPI is reported on Wednesday and producer prices are Thursday.
*****
> A pickup in inflation of any significance is one thing that could pull the Fed from the sidelines, and prod it to consider a rate hike.
*****
> “I think the inflation reports might start to get a little attention. Given the jobs numbers, the employment rate, growth picking up a little bit and a better tone in manufacturing. I do think if you get some hot CPI number, I don’t know if the Fed can ignore it,” he said. “Core CPI is 2.3%.” He said it would get noticed if it jumped to 2.5% or better.
*****
> The Fed’s inflation target is 2% but its preferred measure is the PCE inflation, and that remains under 2%.
*****
> Stocks were sharply higher Friday but ended the past week flattish. The S&P 500 was slightly higher, up 0.2% at 3,145, and the Dow was down 0.1% at 28,015. The Nasdaq was 0.1% lower, ending the week at 8,656.

# Reasons We Still Believe In December

> It has been a rough start to the most wonderful month of them all, with the S&P 500 Index down each of the first two days of December. Don’t stop believing just yet, though.

> Everyone knows December has usually been a good month for stocks, but what happened last year is still fresh in the minds of many investors. The S&P 500 fell 9.1% in December 2018 for the worst December since 1931. That sounds really bad, until you realize stocks fell 30% in September 1931, but we digress.

> One major difference between now and last year is how well the global equities have been performing. Heading into December 2018, the S&P 500 was up 3.2% year to date, but markets outside of the United States were already firmly in the red, with many down double digits.

> “We don’t think stocks are on the verge of another massive December sell off,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “If my Cincinnati Bengals can win a game, anything is possible. However, we are quite encouraged by the overall participation we are seeing from various global stock markets this year versus last year, when the United States was about the only market in the green heading into December.”

> Stocks have also overcome volatile starts to December recently. The S&P 500 was down four days in a row to start 2013 and 2017, but the gauge still managed to gain 2.4% and 1%, respectively, in those years.

> As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, December has been the second-best month of the year for stocks going back to 1950. It is worth noting that it was the best month of the year before last year’s massive drop. Stocks have historically been strong in pre-election years as well, and December has never been lower two times in a row during a pre-election year. Given stocks fell in December 2015, bulls could be smiling when this month is wrapped up.

# Could Impeachment Be Good for Investors?

> Impeaching a President with the possibility of removal from office is by no means great for the country. However, it may not be so horrible for the stock market or investors if history is any guide. We first touched on this over two years ago here on the blog and now that much has transpired and the US House of Representatives is now proceeding with drafting articles of impeachment we figured it was a good time to revisit the history (albeit limited) of market behavior during presidential impeachment proceedings. The three charts below really tell the story.

> During the Watergate scandal of Nixon’s second term the market suffered a major bear market from January 1973 to October/December 1974 with the Dow down 45.1%, S&P 500 down 48.2% and NASDAQ down 59.9%. Sure there were other factors that contributed to the bear market such as the Oil Embargo, Arab-Israeli War, collapse of the Bretton Woods system, high inflation and Watergate. However, shortly after Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974 the market reached the secular bear market low on October 3 for S&P and NASDAQ and December 6 for the Dow.

> Leading up to the Clinton investigations and through his subsequent impeachment and the acquittal by the Senate the market was on a tear as one of the biggest bull markets in history raged on. After the 1994 midterm elections when the Republicans took back control of both houses of Congress the market remained on a 45 degree upward trajectory except for a few blips and the shortest bear market on record that lasted 45 days and bottomed on August 31, 1998.

> Clinton was impeached in December 1998 and acquitted in February 1999 as the market continued higher throughout his second term. Sure there were other factors that contributed to the late-1990s bull-run such as the Dotcom Boom, the Information Revolution, millennial fervor and a booming global economy, but Clinton’s personal scandal had little negative impact on markets.

> It remains to be seen of course what will happen with President Trump’s impeachment proceeding and how the world and markets react, but the market continues to march on. If the limited history of impeachment proceedings of a US President in modern times (no offense to our 17th President Andrew Johnson) is any guide, the market has bounced back after the last two impeachment proceedings and was higher a year later. Perhaps it will be better to buy any impeachment dip rather than sell it.

# Typical December Trading: Modest Strength Early, Choppy Middle and Solid Gains Late

> Historically, the first trading day of December, today, has a slightly bearish bias with S&P 500 advancing 34 times over the last 69 years (since 1950) with an average loss of 0.02%. Tomorrow, the second trading day of December however, has been stronger, up 52.2% of the time since 1950 with an average gain of 0.08% and the third day is better still, up 59.4% of the time.

> Over the more recent 21-year period, December has opened with strength and gains over its first seven trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year when last minute selling, most likely for tax reasons, briefly interrupts the market’s rally.

# Odds Still Favor A Gain for Rest of December Despite Rough Start

> Just when it was beginning to look like trade was heading in a positive direction, the wind changed direction again. Yesterday it was steel and aluminum tariffs on Brazil and Argentina and today a deal with China may not happen as soon as previously anticipated. The result was the worst first two trading days of December since last year and the sixth worst start since 1950 for S&P 500. DJIA and NASDAQ are eighth worst since 1950 and 1971, respectively.

> However, historically past weakness in early December (losses over the first two trading days combined) were still followed by average gains for the remainder of the month the majority of the time. DJIA has advanced 74.19% of the time following losses over the first two trading days with an average gain for the remainder of December of 1.39%. S&P 500 was up 67.65% of the time with an average rest of month gain of 0.84%. NASDAQ is modestly softer advancing 61.11% of the time during the remainder of December with an average advance of 0.30%.

WallStreetBets - YOLOs Of Month (Sp00ktober Tendies Edition),0.93,"I track YOLOs so you don't have to - October 2019

For those of you that aren't familiar with the site I created, it's at:

[Swaggy Stonks - WSB Analyzer](https://www.swaggystocks.com)

It contains a WSB 'Sentiment' analyzer, Due Diligence tracker, and a YOLO tracker.

I've recently added a new section that will contain full, in-depth ""Due Diligence"" reports on certain companies that will include all the data someone needs to know about the company if they want to trade their stock.

[Here's a link to the Due Diligence homepage](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocks/due-diligence)

&#x200B;

**Quick ""How it works""**

I log positions of posts flagged as ""YOLO/Gains/Losses"" and post them to my site. For actual options YOLO plays it will automatically keep track the current value of the play and the win/loss percent. Every position on the site links back to it's appropriate thread on WallStreetBets so you can take a look and read the comments/juicy details as well! All other gains, losses, and expired YOLOs are placed in the ""Expired YOLOs"" section.

Please note I do my best to keep track of them all and sometimes the OP of the YOLO disappears in which case I let the YOLO ride until expiry. It's fun to see what they could be worth!

&#x200B;

**Other Cool Features The Site Has:**

\-**Top YOLO**s section (sorted by upvotes, gains, and losses)

\-**Competitor Analysis Tool**: Compare fundamentals/financials for different tickers.

\-**Options Scanner Tool**: View historical estimated ""prices"" of options. A good tool to view which options are currently expensive or cheap at different ranges of OTM.

\-**Credit Spread Finder**: Search tickers and find how much premium you can receive at 'x' percentage of being OTM and how much you are risking.

\-**Dividend Screener**: Search stocks that offer a dividend and filter them by: sector, dividend amount, and dividend frequency.

If anyone has any feature recommendations, comments, or concerns post here!

Why you are getting burned by GME,0.91,"I am tired of hearing about GME’s bear case so let me tell you why you are losing money on those puts. All of you are stuck in first order thinking, the business has an expiration date so it is worth 0. The business is actually worth whatever it can generate for investors before it goes to 0. So how much is this?

The mkt cap of the company is, as I write this, 450M. The book value of the company is 800M. So already here, even if you are thinking about liquidation you are getting the stock at a discount. Of course the management doesn’t seem to want to liquidate so this might not be an option any time soon.

Management also has authorization to spend $240M in share repurchases. Best case scenario they have already been doing it. What is great about this stock is that it’s daily volume (daily, high single digit Millions) would allow this operation to occur stealthily, giving the potential for a surprise at next ER. A few days ago, someone purchased/sold 3.5M shares (> 4% of outstanding) in 5 minutes and the price barely moved. If they manage to spend at least half of what they are allowed at the current price ($120M), they could purchase 24M shares or 27% of the outstanding shares.  At current prices this would result in a price to book ratio of around 0.5 and a PE of 2. Best case scenario, they have already started buying stock and they manage to buy most of what they are allowed to.

To add to this, the stock is so shorted that any positive news, even if of smaller magnitude of what I highlighted, might cause a short squeeze and send the stock flying.

Worst case scenario nothing of this happens, you are getting a stock for a PE of 3, that is projected to continue being profitable for at least 2020 due to new consoles release, that lasts maybe 3 to 4 more years. Improvements to operations such as closing stores might add to the cash and improve profits on the short term. Cash that can be used to redistribute to shareholders.

Given all of this, I can only imagine the type of idiot that shorted this at $3 a month ago.

In short yes, there is risk to buying this stock, but it has the potential for a massive upside if management actually starts working in distributing profits to shareholders.",2019-09-24 08:11:54

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 9th, 2019.

# **Stocks look to reclaim their all-time highs in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/06/stocks-look-to-reclaim-their-all-time-highs-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Stocks will look to build on their strong recent momentum and reclaim their record highs next week amid a slew of economic data while trade war fears decrease.
*****
> The S&P 500 is about 1.6% from an intraday record reached on July 26 after notching back-to-back weekly gains. The broad index is up 1.8% this past week after surging 2.8% in the last week of August.
*****
> Wall Street’s move toward all-time highs comes as recent U.S. economic data suggests a recession may not be in the cards, and the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates later this month. Easing fears around the U.S.-China trade war are also lifting investor sentiment. If the data remains solid, Fed rate cut expectations stay high and U.S.-China trade tensions lower, the market could climb back to all-time highs.
*****
> “You cannot sell the market ahead of the Fed and you cannot sell the market ahead of the trade talks in October,” Steve Grasso, director of institutional sales at Stuart Frankel and a CNBC contributor, told “Power Lunch.” “For now, it’s a bull run.”
*****
> The U.S. services sector grew at a faster rate than expected in August, the Institute for Supply Management said Thursday. The data offset worries from the manufacturing sector. The ISM said Tuesday that the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted for the first time since early 2016.
*****
> Meanwhile, the Labor Department on Friday reported better-than-expected U.S. wage growth for August at a time when consumer spending is strong. However, the report also showed jobs growth slowed for a third straight month.
*****
> “The U.S. economy should avoid recession,” Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC, wrote in a note. “With slower, but still-solid job gains and good wage growth, households will continue to spend; consumer spending accounts for almost 70 percent of the U.S. economy.”
*****
> Investors will get more information on the state of the consumer next Friday with the release of August retail sales and a preliminary look at September consumer sentiment. Positive data on that front could lift stocks to their records.
*****
> Next week will be important as investors get more clues about the Federal Reserve’s next policy move. August readings for the producer and consumer price indexes are scheduled for release Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.
*****
> The Fed has cited persistently low inflation as one of the reasons for easing monetary policy in the U.S. In July, the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points. Market expectations for another quarter-point rate trim in September are at 93.5%, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
> However, stronger-than-expected inflation could raise questions about whether the Fed will reduce rates later this month.
*****
> “Anything that is speaking directly to inflation is going to be most important” for the market, said James Masserio, co-head of equities in the Americas at Societe Generale. “That’s going to be weighted most heavily in the central bank’s monetary policy decision-making process.”
*****
> “Right now, all asset classes are being greatly influenced by the expectations of changes in monetary policy,” Masserio said.
*****
> The Fed is not slated to meet until the week of Sept. 17, but the European Central Bank will announce its latest monetary policy decision on Thursday. The ECB is largely expected to cut rates with some experts forecasting a restart to its quantitative easing program.
*****
> News around U.S.-China trade talks will continue to play a role in the market next week as investors look for signs of progress in the negotiations. On Thursday, China’s Ministry of Commerce said Chinese trade officials will meet their U.S. counterparts in Washington next month.
*****
> “If there’s a bit more optimism around trade, I think we could get back to those previous highs,” said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. “We’re not far from the previous highs. It wouldn’t take much to get there.”

# Meager “Worst Months” Gains Still the Norm in Pre-Election Years

> With a little more than four months of DJIA’s and S&P 500 “Worst Six Months” already completed, the markets performance thus far has been lackluster and in line with historical averages. NASDAQ’s “Worst Four Months” (July through October) has been similar to DJIA and S&P 500. From the close on April 30 through yesterday’s close, DJIA gained just 0.51%, S&P 500 1.02%. From the end of June NASDAQ has gained 1.38%.

> These are rather slim returns for the amount of time. And this excludes the volatility the market experienced in May and again in August. At their respective lows during late May and early June DJIA and S&P 500 were down over 6%. At the August low, NASDAQ was off nearly 3.5%. Our Seasonal Switching Strategy exited DJIA and S&P 500 positions on May 2 and rotated into bond positions. Those bond positions were up an average of 10.1%, excluding dividends on September 4.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 9/6/19

> Despite a shortened week from the Labor Day holiday, there was a heavy slate of economic data with a total of 30 releases. Half of these came in better than estimates or the prior period's reading while another 13 missed or weakened. Three indicators were in line with estimates. There was a lot of manufacturing data this week including readings from Markit and the ISM, Factory Orders, Durable Goods, and Capital Goods. The ISM reading was the most strikingly negative of these as it showed a contractionary reading. The ISM and Markit service counterparts, on the other hand, showed healthier levels, but the Markit PMI did miss estimates. Labor data also was a major focus this week and the overall results were pretty mixed. ISM employment, initial jobless claims, and today's NFP report all disappointed, but the ADP employment change, continuing claims, and labor force participation rate came in stronger than expected. Similarly, each indicator for wages including quarterly unit labor costs and average earnings showed improvements.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/090619-Eco.png))**

> It will be slightly less busy next week with only 24 releases scheduled. Following up on this week's labor data, the JOLTS report is due out Tuesday morning and is expected to show fewer job openings than June. Inflation indicators like PPI, CPI, and export and import prices make up a considerable portion of next week's data. Core estimates for both PPI and CPI are forecasted to show higher price inflation in August. In addition to preliminary consumer sentiment, on Friday we will also get a reading on retail sales for August. For both core and headline readings, this indicator is expected to slow significantly MoM compared to July.

# Economic Surprise Index Turns Positive

> When it comes to economic reports, one trend that has seemingly been in place all year is that the vast majority of data points have come in short of expectations. The fact that economic momentum has been slowing is one thing, but when the economy consistently comes up short relative to expectations, it sets a tone that things are quickly deteriorating. That's never a good thing, but thankfully, there are signs that the tide is turning.

> The Citi Economic Surprise Index measures the pace at which economic indicators are coming in ahead of or below consensus forecasts. When the index is negative, it means that the majority of reports are coming in below expectations, while a positive reading indicates that most data is coming in ahead of expectations. The chart below shows the index going back to 2003, and the parts where the line is red indicate periods where the index was negative for at least 100 trading days. The most recent period of negative readings was one of the longest ever at 140 trading days and just the 6th streak of 100 or more trading days (during the period from 2015 to 2016 there were actually two separate streaks although it looks like just one long streak in the chart). The fact that this index is now positive indicates that economists have finally ratcheted down estimates enough to be in line with actual conditions on the ground.

# Sentiment Back to Normal

> Bullish investor sentiment as measured by AAII's sentiment survey rose 2.5 percentage points to 28.64% this week. While this is an improvement, bullish sentiment is still in the 18th percentile of the data over the past decade. We must also note that the survey would not have captured any benefit from today's news on the trade front and the technical breakout of stocks and other assets like crude oil. Save a tweet or a headline reversing what appears to be optimism given today's positive price action, we'll likely see a bigger jump in bullish sentiment next week.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/090519-AAII-Bullish.png))**

> Bulls borrowed from the bears this week as bearish sentiment fell from 42.2% last week to 39.5%. As with bullish sentiment, this is not necessarily a dramatic improvement as it is still higher than 83% of weeks over the past 10 years. Bearish sentiment also remains the predominant sentiment level among investors as the bull-bear spread is still fairly wide at -10.87 percentage points. Granted, that is the narrowest spread since the last week of July when it was only 28 bps in favor of bears.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/090519-AAII-Bearish.png))**

> The bulk of the loss in bearish sentiment went to bulls, but a small portion also went to the neutral camp as the percentage of investors reporting as neutral grew to 31.9%. While bullish sentiment is still several percentage points below its historical average and the opposite applying to bearish sentiment, neutral sentiment has been pulling back to its historical average over the past few months. Where it currently sits at 31.9%, it is only 0.33% from that average.

# ISM Services Shows Little Pressure in Inflation

> Following Tuesday's ISM Manufacturing report, we noted the extremely low reading in the monthly ISM Commodities Survey, which measures the number of commodities rising and falling in price. After today's report for the Non-Manufacturing sector, that trend remained in place. In this morning's report, respondents noted price increases in just 6 commodities and decreases in 4. That net reading of +2 is the weakest reading since January. Combining the results of both reports, in August we saw a total of just 8 commodities up in price and 15 lower. That reading of negative 7 was the lowest since February 2016, while the three-month moving average of -4.0 was the lowest since April 2016.

> As we noted on Tuesday, low readings in the commodities survey usually track the direction of inflation readings pretty closely and would imply that the current y/y reading of 1.8% in CPI will see downward pressure in the months ahead. For example, in the eight prior months where the three-month moving average in the combined reading was between zero and negative five, the average y/y reading in CPI was +0.45% while the median level was +0.65%.

# Low P/E, Low Return

> Most investors are trying to forget about August performance as quickly as possible, but we wanted to highlight a noteworthy data set about the month before it gets too far into the rear-view mirror. At the end of every month, we run our decile analysis of the S&P 500 to see which stock characteristics drove performance the most. One characteristic we look at is valuation, and in August, valuations played a big role in performance.

> Below we've broken up the S&P 500 into deciles based on P/E ratios (trailing 12-month). Decile 1 contains the 50 stocks in the S&P with the lowest P/Es at the start of August, while decile 10 contains the 50 stocks in the index with the highest (or negative) P/Es. Each bar in the chart shows the average percentage change in August of the 50 stocks in each decile.

> As shown, the 50 stocks in the S&P with the lowest P/E ratios at the start of the month fell an average of 11.5% in August! The next two deciles with the lowest P/E ratios fell more than 5% as well. On the other end of the spectrum, the 50 stocks with the highest P/E ratios fell only 0.78% in August.

> You've certainly heard a lot about the ""death of value investing"" recently, and this is why! We have to think that at some point the scales will tip and head in the other direction.

# Down August, Up YTD, No Worries

> Now that the very volatile month of August has finished on the downside folks are concerned about the other worst month, September, and for good reason. Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year. However, while August was negative this year with the market still up year-to-date the prospects for Q4 and the year as a whole are not so ominous. In fact, it’s kind of bullish.

> Early last month we relayed the historical data on August declines being quite commonplace though overall, years with August declines were quite choppy and not especially bullish. However when the market was up year-to-date at the end of August despite an August decline the picture changes dramatically. In the tables here you can see that after some extended volatility and negativity in September Q4 and the year as a whole has been rather positive.

> Since 1949 in years the market was up YTD in August but down for the month DJIA was up in September 56.3% of the time (9 of 16) with an average gain of 0.76%, up in Q4 81.3% of the time (13 of 16) with an average gain of 5.68% and up for the year 100% of the time with an average gain of 17.43%.

> The S&P has a similar record up 58.8% of the time in September (10 of 17) with an average gain of 0.81%, up in Q4 94.1% of the time with an average gain of 5.73% and up for the year 100% of the time with an average gain of 20.21%.

> Since 1971 NASDAQ was up in September 66.7% of the time (6 of 9) with an average gain of 0.35%, up in Q4 66.7% of the time (6 of 9) with an average gain of 4.04% and up for the year 100% of the time with an average gain of 21.72%. NASDAQ was hit much harder in the 1983 bear market and 1997 Asian Financial Crisis than the much larger cap (at the time) DJIA and S&P.

Time to start buying GAMESTOP $GME again.,0.67,"I think the shorts finally went long, new Sony and MSFT consoles coming out in 2020, Walmart is not selling violent video games anymore, they got a Bitchin new website and dude, it’s GameStop.

GME,0.92,"I took a look at Gamestop after reading that budget Mark Cuban bought 3% of the company on the basis that their balance sheet was ""actually good"" and that new disk-based consoles would ""extend their life significantly."" 
Am I missing something here? Their balance sheet looks like a wreck. Downsizing property significantly over past few years. Their inventory can't be holding value in any shape yet it is only increasing. Do they count all of those ps2 sleeves floating around in the ocean?

Its basically on unseen lows right now, I'll be adding equity on any red days, $3.65 atm is cheap. Also will be placing a few long term calls. Cover call is the best to minimize risk. Going jan 17 '20 4 strike for .75 a contract lmao. And apr 17 '20 6 strike for .55

Michael Burry, the autistic genius from The Big Short, is currently long 3% of GME and trying to start an epic short squeeze.

Over 50% of the outstanding shares are short and the company has enough cash on hand to buy back more than the entire market cap of the company. All they need to do to start a historical short squeeze is to get off their asses and start buying.

Why losing $2600 playing GME earnings was the best thing that ever happened to me,0.96,"Hey guys,

Some of you may know me as the guy who was long GME yesterday. To those of you who don't know me, let me introduce myself. Hi I'm mike.

It may seem like a sudden shock to suddenly lose $2600 by going long a failing company. But in fact it has been an enormous blessing. I am able to spend more time with the family and do things like gardening, or making some toast in the bathtub, or slowly sharpening every knife in the house while staring intently at my wrists. I've also been practicing loading and reloading my gun so I'll be ready in case of self-defense. Another fun fact is that my head fits perfectly in the Ninja Pro blender I got with the anticipation of making oat milk to go with my GME tendies.

I'm taking the liberty of deleting Robinhood, and hitting the gym. That was long overdue. Turns out paying $6.50 per trade is worth it so you put a little more thought before making a series of retarded impulse buys. 

Thanks for listening to my story (FYI based on my most recent DD, GME is currently the most undervalued it has ever been, long GME)",2019-06-06 06:21:35
At what stock price does WSB take over GameStop (GME)?,0.99,"GME's float is 99.29 mil... once GME gets down to about 50 cents a share it will only take about 45 mil to take that bitch over. 

Once we have full ownership we can turn all of Gamestop's brick and mortar retail stores into a fast casual burrito restaurant/high quality workout clothing retailer/coffee shop combo all in one and rake in dough from all the ~~white bitches~~ fine young independent retail shoppers of America. 

Thoughts?",2019-06-05 19:42:57
$GME Calls?,0.78,"How dumb of an idea is this? GME is currently down 37.5% for the day, my thinking is there has to be some sort of bounce over the next couple weeks. Calls are down like 90%, so it's a super cheap entry.",2019-06-05 18:09:33

* It's a new month for Wall Street, but so far it appears it will begin the same way the old one ended — with losses. The Dow has now fallen for six consecutive weeks for the first time in eight years, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have posted four straight weekly declines, as ongoing tariff tensions with China and now Mexico as well as U.S. economic uncertainty loom.

* The Dow's Friday close was its lowest since Jan. 29, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at their lowest since March 8. And although the Nasdaq is still up more than 12% for the year, it is moving closer to correction with a nearly 9% decline from its May 3 record closing high. (CNBC)
* Goldman Sachs (GS) sees increased risks of escalations of U.S. trade disputeswith China and Mexico. There is now a 60% chance of the U.S. placing a new 10% tariff on the final $300 billion of Chinese imports. There is now a 70% chance of Trump imposing 5% duties on Mexican goods and a 50% chance that goes to 10%. (CNBC)

* On the economic calendar, at 10 a.m. ET, both the May ISM manufacturing index and April construction spending are out. Some of the nation's automakers issue May sales today, although Ford (F) and GM (GM) only report on a quarterly basis. There are no major earnings this morning. Box (BOX) releases its quarterly number after today's closing bell.
* President Donald Trump arrived for his first state visit to Britain today. Cracks are starting to appear in the transatlantic relationship, with political analysts concerned that his ""off-the-cuff"" and ""impulsive"" leadership style could make matters worse over the coming days. (CNBC)

* Everything you need to know about Trump's state visit (CNBC)

* More than 300 Boeing (BA) 737 jets, including the Max, may have faulty wing parts that don't meet strength and durability standards, the FAA said, following a joint investigation with the aircraft manufacturer. The agency plans to order airlines to remove and replace the parts if their aircraft are affected. (CNBC)
* Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google unit is the subject of an upcoming antitrust probeby the Justice Department, according to multiple reports. The probe will focus on Google's search and other businesses. (CNBC)
* Apple (AAPL) is expected to launch the latest version of iOS, its software for the iPhone and iPad, today at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference.The company has launched a new version of its iPhone software at WWDC every year since 2009, and analysts and reports don't expect this year to be any different. (CNBC)
* Facebook (FB) has been in contact with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission about rolling out a digital currency, according to the Financial Times.
* SoftBank's bid to raise a $100 billion fund is off to a rocky start, the Wall Street Journal reports. Some of the world's biggest money managers plan to make limited or no contributions to the Japanese technology giant.
* Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) is discussing an improved bid for French carmaker Renault, according to Reuters, in order to win backing from the French government for a deal.

#**DISCUSS!**

What is on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/wallstreetbets?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Monday, June 3rd, 2019! :)**",2019-06-03 13:06:13
"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning June 3rd, 2019",0.96,"Hey what's happening r/wallstreetbets! Good afternoon and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week and month of June ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 3rd, 2019.

# **Fed officials and Trump’s latest trade threat could decide whether June starts with a market swoon  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/31/fed-officials-and-trumps-latest-trade-threat-could-decide-whether-june-starts-with-a-market-swoon.html)**
*****
> Federal Reserve officials speaking at a policy conference may get a lot more attention than usual in the week ahead after President Donald Trump’s latest tariff threat against Mexico ramped up expectations for interest rate cuts.
*****
> Markets will also start the month of June, which is often flat for markets, coming off a painful 6.6% monthly loss in the S&P 500.
*****
> Stocks lost ground in May on worries that the U.S. trade war with China would hurt the global economy and bite into earnings growth. They will begin trading in June with new worries that tariffs on Mexico could hurt the economy and threaten a new trade deal between the U.S., Mexico and Canada.
*****
> The coming week has a full calendar of economic data, with the highlight being Friday’s May employment report. There are also monthly auto sales and Institute for Supply Management manufacturing data due Monday, and international trade data expected Thursday.
*****
> But it is the Fed that should get the most attention, with central bank officials gathering at a much-anticipated conference hosted by the Chicago Fed Tuesday and Wednesday. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will make the opening remarks at the conference, which is about monetary policy strategy, tools and communications. For months, strategists have been hoping the conference will provide insight into how the Fed intends to address sluggish inflation.
*****
> Interest in the event is even higher after the market and Fed watchers are increasingly convinced the central bank will now cut rates this year, and maybe more than once. The futures market priced in increasing expectations for two rate cuts after Trump’s threat to put tariffs on all Mexican goods if the Mexican government does not stop immigration into the U.S.
*****
> After the last Fed meeting, Powell said low inflation appears to be transitory, suggesting the Fed would not have to cut rates, but markets still anticipate a rate cut, and inflation continues to run below the Fed’s 2% target.
*****
> Michael Gapen, Barclays chief U.S. economists, said investors hoping to hear Fed officials discuss their thinking on current policy could be disappointed. Gapen said the Fed is also about nine months away from its decision on how it will frame inflation, and the conference will be more about academic views on it.
*****
> Gapen was one of several Wall Street economists Friday who changed his view on the Fed’s rate policy. He said he now sees the Fed cutting the fed funds target rate by 75 basis points in two cuts this year, with the Fed starting at 50 basis points in September. The Fed has said does not foresee any rate cuts this year, nor hikes, and has stressed it is on hold.
*****
> Gapen does not expect to hear much from Fed officials at the conference on rates, though investors will be combing through every word looking for policy clues.
*****
> “I don’t think that’s the type of setting where anyone would make a monetary policy comment in advance of an FOMC meeting,” he said. The Fed next meets on June 18 and 19.
*****
> Gapen said he went from expecting no Fed move to two rate cuts because the trade war with China has become more extended than expected; manufacturing and business spending are weakening, and because of Trump’s threat to put tariffs on Mexico if it doesn’t control immigrants heading into the U.S. over the southern border.
*****
> “It does suggest the administration is willing to pursue multiple fronts. It lowers the bar for tariffs on Europe,” he said.
*****
> Interest rates continued to slide Friday, to multi-year lows. The 2-year yield, which most reflects Fed policy, fell sharply and was at 1.93% in late trading. The 10-year yield, at 2.55% in early May, was at 2.13% Friday afternoon. The S&P 500 was down 2.6% for the week, ending its worst week of the year at 2,752.
*****
> Sam Stovall, CFRA chief market strategist, said a “May mauling usually leads to a boom in June.” Going back to World War II, whenever there was a strong start to the year, the market traditionally fell in May but rose in June. Plus, this year was the third best start through April.
*****
> John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank, said beyond the trade headlines, there are quite a few market catalysts in June.
*****
> “June is going to be very event-driven. It’s going to be the Fed on June 19. It’s going to be OPEC on June 25; it’s going be the G-20 on June 29,” he said.
*****
> He added, “We’re going to stay balanced and diversified because we don’t know how things are going to come out.”

# Time For A June Swoon?

> Well, it finally happened. The S&P 500 Index pulled back more than 5% from its all-time high, marking the first 5% pullback of 2019. As we have discussed many times over the past two months, the odds were high that some type of pullback or even correction (10% or more off the highs) was likely after the 25% surge off the December 2018 lows.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5-Corrections-are-normal.png?ssl=1))**

> May likely will be the first negative month of the year (down nearly 6% with two days to go) and likely will be the first time stocks closed in the red in May since 2012.

> Now, seasonality hints to more volatility ahead, as June doesn’t have the best history for stocks. “We finally had a 5% pullback, but the bad news is June can be a tricky month for stocks,” explained Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Going back the past 20 years, only September has been worse on average, and returns have been quite poor in June after a big drop in May.”

> As our LPL Chart of the day shows, stocks have tended to be weak in June over various periods.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Time-For-A-June-Swoon-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Here are six thoughts to chew on as we turn the calendar:

> * When the S&P 500 has lost 5% in May (like it could in 2019), June’s performance has been weak. May has lost 5% or more only four other times in the past 50 years, and stocks subsequently fell more than 5% in June twice.
> * However, when the S&P 500 has been up more than 10% year to date heading into June (like it could in 2019), the S&P 500 has gained 9 of the past 12 times (going back 50 years), and has been higher 1.9% on average.
> * Equity markets in Greece, Brazil, India, Argentina, and Australia are all very strong. If we were truly entering a global recession, we would see more broad-based global weakness.
> * The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) daily put/call ratio surged to its highest level since late December yesterday, suggesting a good deal of fear is coming into the market – a necessary recipe for a bottom to form.
> * Only 31% of the components in the S&P 500 are above their 50-day moving average. This is nearing washout levels, but could need to go down to 20% before the ultimate low can form. Still, we are getting closer.
> * The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Investor Sentiment Survey has more than 40% bears, the highest since the start of 2019. That’s another sign fear is spiking, and pessimism could be a bullish contrarian signal.

# DJIA Six Week Losing Streaks

> Barring a 700+ point rally into the close (hey, anything is possible), the DJIA is on pace for its first six-week losing streak since June 2011 and the 32nd such streak going back to 1900. As of this writing, the DJIA is down 6.46% over the course of this current losing streak, which would go down as the mildest six-week losing streak for the index since June 1976 and the fifth 'mildest' six-week losing streak on record. The chart below highlights each of the DJIA's prior six-week losing streaks since 1900 and shows how much the index declined during each one of them.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/053119-Six-Week-losing-Streaks-1.png))**

> While there have been quite a few six-week losing streaks for the DJIA in its history, it is not common for them to go on into a seventh week. As shown in the chart below, just seven of the DJIA's 32 prior six-week losing streaks have last seven or more weeks, and a 7-week losing streak stretching to an eighth week is practically unheard of with just one way back in 1923.

# DJIA and S&P 500 Up Six Straight on June’s First Trading Day

> According to the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2019 (page 86), the first trading day of June is the sixth best first trading day of all twelve months with DJIA gaining a cumulative 299.85 points since 1998. Over the past 24 years, DJIA’s first trading day of June has produced gains 70.8% of the time with an average gain of 0.04%. Sizable losses in 2002, 2011 and 2012 limit overall performance. S&P 500 has advanced 66.7% of the time. NASDAQ has been slightly weaker at 58.3% as has the Russell 2000 at 62.5%. Following three straight losses from 2010 to 2012, DJIA and S&P 500 have advanced six straight years on the first trading day of June.

# Typical June Trading: Any Early Gains Tend to Fade

> Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Looking at the chart above, shaded areas highlight areas of strength during the month. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into negative territory just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-cap. This June could turn out better than average as a result of a strong start to the year and weakness in May.

# Strong Starts Weak Mays Boon for June

> Our previous analysis of big gains the first four months indicated weakness was in store for the merry month of May. Now that the market has indeed suffered this May the outlook for June is a boon at least historically speaking.

> The table below shows the top 20 first four month gains for the for the S&P 500 with the subsequent changes for May, June, Rest of the Year, “Worst Six Months” May-October, 2nd half July-December and full year performance. While most of the full year gains are clearly logged in these big first-four-month gains, there still upside to be had in the latter part of the year.

> May is weakest and May 2019 has delivered market declines so far, down -4.9% for the S&P 500 as of today’s close. However, after big starts, 7 of the 9 subsequent May declines were followed by big gains in June (highlighted in green). So, while we do not anticipate much upside over the next 5 months or so, June is set up for a boon.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 5/31/19

> This week's economic data came in split down the middle with 12 releases coming in worse than the prior period or estimates and another 12 improving. A remaining 3 met expectations or were unchanged from the previous period. We noted this same pattern in our Matrix of Economic Indicators for April. The FHFA's House Price Purchase Index for the first quarter was the first release of a shortened week coming in unchanged from the previous quarter at 1.1%. Monthly FHFA and Case-Shiller prices also came out on Tuesday with both showing slower home price growth. Later that morning the Conference Board's readings on Consumer Confidence came in stronger than both forecasts and the April reading. The final release Tuesday, the Dallas Fed's Manufacturing Activity, disappointed at -5.3 versus expectations of 6.2. On Wednesday, the Richmond Fed's Manufacturing Activity index also came in below expectations but was stronger than the April reading. The second release of Q1 GDP was revised lower but less than expected with growth for Q1 now sitting at 3.1% QoQ SAAR. While consumption growth was stronger, that came thanks in part to inflation measures falling below estimates. Retail and Inventories grew more than expected in April as seen in their Thursday release. Pending home sales were also notably weak. Friday data was better with Personal Income and Spending numbers both beating estimates. Michigan Sentiment was the final release of the week with a reading of 100.0 versus forecasts of 101.5, both below the 102.4 reported in preliminary data.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/053119-eco.png))**

> With 34 releases, the data slate picks up next week. Monday we will get some important manufacturing data including the final data for May for the Markit PMI and ISM Manufacturing. Revisions for durable goods and the broader factory orders numbers for April will follow up on Tuesday. As next week is the first week of June, on Wednesday ADP will release their employment data for the month of May. This is expected to show fewer jobs created than April. The service portions of Markit PMIs and ISM will also come out Wednesday morning. In addition to the usual Thursday weekly releases, Nonfarm Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the first quarter are expected. The Employment Situation Report with its Nonfarm Payrolls number will round out the week in economic data on Friday morning.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week ahead?

I hope you all have a fantastic weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets! :)",2019-06-01 19:03:45
GME earnings is a bear trap,0.75,"I usually don't make ER predictions or play with options but this one is screaming at me as an obvious ""what goes down must come up"" autism play.

Look at how far this stock has fallen. Fundamentally the valuation is now extraordinarily cheap, it is trading below net cash. Technically this cash is necessary to stock up on inventory before the busier quarters in the second half of the year,  but, this doesn't change the fact that the business could be liquidated tomorrow probably at a net gain to the shareholders.

Management desperately wants the stock to rise. Putting myself on a limb here to sound like an idiot later, but why the fuck would they cut the dividend if it's essentially the only attractive thing about the stock? Where is their magic wand to put that money to good use? They are divesting, not investing. 

I think:

1. This stock is fundamentally undervalued and can say this with confidence

2. the dividend probably does not get cut as there is no good alternate use for the funds

3.  This stock goes back to $9 in the weeks after ER.

Takeaway is to look at calls that expire a few weeks after ER. If they are rising in value(expected move) before ER, then do not play with the options but consider an equity earnings play -- low risk, solid reward. If they are falling in value before ER, buy calls on the panic.",2019-06-01 04:28:54
GME: Bound to plummet?,0.96,"Gamestop still hasn't cut their dividend which is in the 19% range and historically they should be declaring in a week or two. Will they cut their dividend, or are they going to pay out $$$ next month? Seems like a good stock to both own and buy some puts.",2019-05-22 17:10:40
Gamble with me,0.93,"Some plays for y'all. Obviously I don't condone doing anything posted here and your investment choices are yours alone. Options are very risky etc etc. I'm posting this primarily to hear reddit's thoughts on my positions.

I invest in shit I understand and believe in. I have a medical background so i focus on healthcare. My philosophy is to go long and try to stay away from FDs as much as possible. I don't have the time to be checking my phone throughout the day or worrying about my positions. I set it and forget it.

I will not advise you on individual strike, expiration etc. If you can't figure that out for yourself you need to stay away from this game. 


DexCom: this is a diabetes company that makes blood glucose sensors that don't require traditional calibration via finger stick. Totally revolutionized the industry with their G6 continuous glucose monitoring system. Their sensors are used with Tandems insulin pumps and they've partnered with Eli Lilly (
https://provider.dexcom.com/industry-news/dexcom-announces-development-agreement-lilly-integrate-dexcom-cgm-connected-diabetes) and Novo nordisk as well recently. The next gen G7 sensor is in development with Alphabet a development partner. 

The stock has recently taken a beating due to competition from Abbott's freestyle libre system which is similar to DexComs system. There are subtle differences. I believe DexCom makes the superior product by a thin margin. The next generation product, the G7 will likely be far superior to anything on the market.

I think the diabetes market is large enough to support multiple large competitors anyways. 

Earnings are May 1st. I am bullish because I believe outlook on this company is great, Tandem did great with their last earnings and diabetes is rampant. Go long. 


Novartis: 
Can we talk about this company for a sec?

Just take a second and look at that beast of a pipeline. 

Take a look at some of their assets. Some big names include Entresto and Gleevec. I'm super bullish because of their gad Dotatate product Lutathera, used for imaging AND treatment of neuroendocrine tumors. It's some real advanced shit and a real money maker for hospitals. 

Recent shift to focus on high margin products, including sell off of Alcon. Market perceived this as negative for some reason? I'm bullish.

Check the RSI on this company in the teens. 

We're going into earnings soon. This may be the one for FDs, tbh. 


GME:
Come on now. Do I even need to say anything here? This pos going to Earth's core. Their business model is fucked with streaming games coming. Disc-less Xbox to be announced in May, that will be a shot to the knees. The more we hear about Stadia (alphabet's streaming game service) and the likely soon to be announced competition from Amzn, this stock will continue to crater further and further. Moreover, they've guided eps of 0.00 for first quarter. So that nice dividend they've been paying out for so long? That won't be sustainable much longer when their cash flow is negative and the coffers are empty.

Short this shit. Long dated puts as volume allows. 


MCD: 
I'm gonna be honest here. I recently watched the Ray kroc movie on Netflix and fell in love with McDonald's as a company. Ray Kroc was one of us. 

Besides all that, MCD doing some great shit with the drive thru and incorporating AI, data harvesting and all sorts of smart 2019 tech into their restaurants. It's some really innovative stuff. Big data works, just ask Daddy Trump. 

Long dated calls/spreads and shares is the play here. 

They've got earnings coming up, I don't see any particular reason to partake in FD type gambling. Instead, the smart move would be to sell puts at peak IV, as the worst that can happen is you pick up some shares of a great company that's very likely to do well long term. Or buy LEAP calls and sell weekly, OTM calls against those if you're bullish short term.... I'm not even sure why I bother writing this, I know y'all will be buying FD calls at $210 the second the market opens anyways.

Edit: I don’t want them to continue operations. I know their business model is in danger. I know their sales are going to be decreasing. I’m not saying profit from a turnaround, I’m saying profit from the company distributing their assets after it’s all said and done.

People have posted about the Big Short guy, Burry, having a position in GME. Idk what his angle is, but here is mine. Tell me if I’m stupid.

Declining sales are a given, and the whole business model is in danger. So out of business right. Is that bad? People mentioned it being a value trap, but is it one if they don’t go bankrupt? I did the Altman Z score (bankruptcy risk assessment) and got a score of 2.95. 3 means they’re probably not going bankrupt. People say that Altman isn’t really relevant anymore, so then just looking at their debt (818 million) can be covered by their cash alone (864 million) and total assets are 2x total liabilities. So I don’t think they’d go bankrupt. 

My calculations got me to a book value per share of 14.30, but websites have it more around 13.50. So I’ll use that. 

If you average 7% in the market, for 5 years, your CAGR is 28.7%

Holding onto GME until they closed up shop would deny you those returns. So to get an equal return, using 13.50 as the price you’d get per share upon dissolution, you’d need to buy in at $9.63. Anything below is a higher return. 

I also did a call valuation method using their debt as the strike price and I also got low 14s.

TL,DR: long GameStop because they aren’t going bankrupt, and after paying off debtors, you could receive 13.50 per share?",2019-04-13 22:03:27

# **Key data could end or defend recession fears as stocks notch best quarter in a decade  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/29/data-could-end-or-defend-recession-fears-as-stocks-notch-best-quarter.html)**
*****
> Stocks head into the second quarter propelled by the best quarter in nearly a decade as the long tepid IPO market starts to simmer again.
*****
> But the markets also face a reality check in the week ahead with some key data that could help clarify whether the economy is losing steam or just stumbling through a soft patch. The key release is Friday's March jobs report, with economists expecting 170,000 new nonfarm payrolls, after February's deeply disappointing 20,000 jobs, according to Refinitiv. There is also important manufacturing data from China over the weekend and the U.S. on Monday.
*****
> Lyft Inc's big IPO Friday on the back of Levi Strauss the week earlier has boosted some optimism for a year of new offerings that some analysts say could rival or surpass the more than $100 billion record of new issues in the year 2000, if conditions remain good.
*****
> ""The Levi Strauss IPO and the success it had last week encouraged many of these companies to accelerate their timing,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Advisors. ""IPO issuance has been modest relative to history for the last couple of years, so the fact we're finally seeing some companies come to market may signal some kind of optimism or confidence, but it's far from the type of thing we've seen historically in terms of the euphoria surrounding it.""
*****
> Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Alliance said with $700 million in potential offerings in the wings, this year could surpass the all-time record reached in 2000, when the new issue market was viewed as overheated and many companies without earnings or prospects made it into the public arena during the tech bubble.
*****
> ""In general, big IPOs tend to drive general enthusiasm for the overall market until they don't do well,"" said Hogan, noting the follow through trading in Lyft, the biggest IPO since Alibaba went public in 2014. Lyft, priced at $72, surged about 20 percent on the opening but closed up just about 8.7 percent at $78.29.
*****
> Stocks were higher in the past week, and the S&P 500 turned in its best first quarter performance since 1998. The 12.9 percent gain was also the best quarterly performance since the third quarter of 2009, just as the now 10-year-old bull market took off. The S&P is now less than 4 percent from its record high.
*****
> Earnings season kicks off in the next several weeks, and between now and then there could be some high profile warnings on the first quarter, expected to be the first quarter with negative earnings growth in three years.
*****
> Arone said while earnings are expected to be weaker, revenues are expected to grow by nearly 5 percent, a positive sign.
*****
> ""That needs to be reconciled form my perspective. It wouldn't shock me if companies doe better than expected, and end up with positive year-over-year comparisons,"" said Arone.
*****
> Trade talks with China remain the overriding issue for markets. Chinese Vice Premier Lui He comes to Washington to meet with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who traveled to Beijing this past week.
*****
> Analysts expect a deal in the coming months. ""We're likely to get some type of negotiated deal that both sides can claim victory on, where China will buy more U.S. goods, where there is some progress on U.S. intellectual property and technology transfers...But I don't see a deal that's going to be a game changer...a big move in one direction. I think the market has accepted that reality,"" said Arone.
*****
> In the past week, stocks were higher but so were bonds, to the point where the 10-year yield reached a low of 2.34 percent before returning to the 2.40 percent level. Yields move opposite price.
*****
> The week earlier, the 10-year yield dipped beneath the yield on the 3-month bill, meaning the yield curve was inverted. When that happens and long-term rates are lower than short-term rates, it is viewed as a recession warning. Practically it would mean lenders, who borrow on a short term basis, would be lending at the lower longer term rates.
*****
> The bond market also moved to price in a Fed interest rate cut this year, after pricing in a hike just several months ago. That was in response to the Fed's forecast for no more rate cuts this year, released after its March meeting. It had been forecasting two interest rate hikes previously. The fed funds futures now is priced for a quarter point of easing this year and another next year.
*****
> Markets calmed down as the week came to a close, but every piece of data has become more important. On a positive note, weekly jobless claims data, the most current look at the labor market, showed a downtick and the four week average is now 217,000, the lowest since January.
*****
> The economy's growth definitely slowed down in the first quarter and growth was tracking at about 1.5 percent, after the 2.2 percent gain in the fourth quarter. Economists have expected the weakness in the first quarter, both due to the government shutdown and bad winter weather, to be temporary but the question is whether growth can get a jump start in the second quarter.
*****
> ""The jobs number is key here,"" said Wilmington Trust chief economist Luke Tilley. The February report showed just a tenth of the job creation many economists had expected. ""Our best thinking it it's statistical volatility, and it's not a real indication of what's going on in the labor market, and it will bounce back. That's the most important thing that's coming out next week....We think about 200,000 jobs were added. I think there's some upside risks to that.""
*****
> Tilley said manufacturing data in the week ahead will be important, as it could show whether the sector remained sluggish at the end of the first quarter. March ISM manufacturing and PMI data will be released Monday, and durable goods, which includes business spending data, is important when it is released on Tuesday. Monthly vehicle sales are also released Tuesday.
*****
> Economists expect ISM manufacturing at 54.2, unchanged from the month earlier. China was also to release manufacturing PMI data over the weekend.
*****
> February's delayed U.S. retail sales report is also expected on Monday. Retail sales are expected to have gained 0.3 percent in the month, up from 0.2 percent in January and December's shocking decline.
*****
> Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said he's watching for any sign of inflation in wages when the jobs report is released Friday. The Fed's preferred PCE inflation index showed sluggish inflation growth, up just 0.1 percent in February.
*****
> ""I don't think [the data] is as big an issue as it was when the Fed was actively talking about raising rates,"" said Massocca. 
""They said publicly they're not going to raise rates for the rest fo the year.""
*****
> There are just a few Fed speakers, who will be of interest because of the change in market expectations for Fed interest rate policy. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester speaks Thursday, and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speaks both Wednesday and Friday.

# What Does A Big First Quarter Mean?

> With a day to go, this is one of the best first quarters for the S&P 500 Index ever. Of course, it comes on the heels of the worst fourth quarter since the financial crisis and the worst December since the Great Depression. Still, you have to be impressed with the overall bounce back after the big drop late last year.

> “A big start to the year historically has suggested the bulls could remain in charge the rest of the year,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, 9 of the past 10 times the S&P 500 was up at least 10% during the first quarter, the rest of the year was also in the green.”

> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, continued gains the final three quarters of the year were quite normal after a big first quarter. It is worth noting, however, that extreme gains might not be in the cards, as the average return for the final three quarters of the year is 5.8%, which is actually lower than the average year’s final three quarters of 6.3%.

# April Almanac: DJIA’s Best Month

> April marks the end of our “Best Six Months” for DJIA and the S&P 500. On April 1st, we will begin looking for our seasonal MACD sell signal and corresponding early signs of seasonal weakness. Even in historically strong pre-election years the “Worst Six Months” have been lackluster on average. 

> April 1999 was the first month to gain 1000 DJIA points. However, from 2000 to 2005, “Tax” month was hit, declining in four of six years. Since 2006, April has been up thirteen years in a row with an average gain of 2.3% to reclaim its position as the best DJIA month since 1950. April is third best for S&P and fourth best for NASDAQ (since 1971).

> The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. The effect of April 15 Tax Deadline appears to be diminished with numerous bullish days present on either side of the day. Traders and investors are clearly focused on first quarter earnings and guidance during April. Exceptional Q1 earnings and positive surprises tend to be anticipated with stocks and the market moving up in advance of the announcements and consolidating or correcting afterwards.

> Typical pre-election year strength does bolster April’s performance since 1950. April is DJIA’s best month in pre-election years (+4.0%), second best for S&P 500 (+3.5%) and third best for NASDAQ (+3.5%). Small caps measured by the Russell 2000 also perform well with gains (+2.8%) in seven of ten pre-election year April’s since 1979.

# First Trading Day of Q2: DJIA and S&P 500 Higher 75% of the Time

> According to the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2019, the first trading day of April is DJIA’s fifth best first trading day of all months based upon total points gained. Looking back at the last 25 years, in the tables below, we can see DJIA and S&P 500 have both advanced 75.0% of the time (up 18 of last 24) with average gains right around 0.4%. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have slightly weaker track records but are both still up more frequently then down. Last year, April’s first trading day was dealt a blow with losses exceeding 2% by S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000.

# Good News Indicators

> The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) is one of our favorite economic indicators. It is designed to predict future movements in the economy based on a composite of 10 economic indicators (like manufacturers’ new orders, stock prices, and weekly unemployment claims) whose changes tend to precede shifts in the overall economy. Last week, the LEI expanded for the first time in five months, along the way tying the all-time high set September 2018. Additionally, it is up 3% year over year (YoY).

> The combination of continued weak economic data around the globe and various parts of the yield curve inverting are leading many to surmise that a recession is likely imminent. The good news is that the LEI has not turned negative on a YoY basis, which it has done prior to every recession since the 1970s. And even when it has turned negative, it was another eight months on average before a recession officially occurred (with a median of six months lag time). For this reason, and because of its solid track record of predicting recessions, the LEI is a component of LPL Research’s Five Forecasters.

> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the LEI remains well above the 0% YoY threshold, which would be a definite negative—on multiple levels.

# 11 Things You Need To Know About The Yield Curve

> Well, it finally happened—the yield curve inverted. Now note that it was the shorter end of the curve that inverted, as the 3-month Treasury bill (and 1-year T-bill) now yields more than the 10-year Treasury for the first time since 2007. This matters because an inverted yield curve is the bond market’s way of saying there is a potential recession on the horizon. “The yield curve inversion is something that nearly everyone is talking about, given its perfect track record at predicting recessions,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “At the same time, however, we simply aren’t seeing other areas of the economy that would confirm a recession just yet, so there is more to this story.”

> Please note that there is no one true “yield curve,” as the yield curve simply looks at the yields of a shorter-dated fixed income instrument and compares it to a longer-dated one. In fact, the more commonly discussed 2-year/10-year yield curve spread hasn’t inverted, and it is actually above the early December 2018 lows.

> Here are 11 things worth considering regarding the yield curve.

> * Each of the past 9 recessions back to the 1950s saw the 1-year/10-year yield curve spread invert approximately 14 months on average before a recession.
> * Although a yield curve inversion preceded all 9 previous recessions, not all inversions led to a recession. For instance, the 3-month/10-year yield curve inverted in 1966 and 1998, with neither leading to an immediate recession.
> * The shorter end of the yield curve has inverted, but the longer end is actually steepening. For instance, the 10-year/30-year yield curve has steepened most of this year. In past recessions, all parts of the curve inverted before a recession took place.
> * Financial conditions aren’t tight, as tight conditions coupled with the yield curve inverting, historically has led to a recession. Investment-grade corporate and high yield spreads remain calm, however, suggesting that not all parts of the bond market are worried about an impending recession.
> * Market participants have fully priced in a Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut within the next year, potentially further flattening the curve. Should the economy gain steam during the second half of this year (which we think is possible) it will likely avoid a Fed rate cut, which should lead to a steeper yield curve.
> * We have found that a spread between the 3-month/10-year yield curve has become much more predictive of a recession at -50 basis points (-0.50%). So this still is a clear concern, but a marginal inversion may not be so worrisome.
> * Yield curves aren’t always perfect: Japan has had long stretches of inverted curves that didn’t lead to recessions. Additionally, both the United Kingdom and Germany have had inversions without recessions.
> * The fed funds rate has been significantly higher during previous inversions. In fact, the fed funds rate has averaged more than 6% when the 1-year/10-year yield curve has inverted. It is only 2.4% currently.
> * The previous 5 recessions began an average of 21 months after the 2-year/10-year yield curve inverted. Stocks actually did quite well initially after inversions as well, with the S&P 500 Index not peaking until over a year after the inversions and gaining nearly 22% on average at the peak.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/7-16-18_Blog_table1_0319.png?ssl=1))**

> * Various yields around the globe continue to sink, with nearly $10 trillion in global debt now yielding less than 0%. The German 10-year Bund, for instance, is beneath 0% for the first time since 2016. We think this is due more to a concern over the European slowdown, which has forced many to look to the United States as a safe haven for sovereign debt, thus pushing our yields much lower along the way. This concept is discussed in more depth in our latest episode of the LPL Market Signals podcast.
> * As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has actually outperformed the average year the previous three times the 2-year/10-year yield curve inverted. To reiterate though, the 2/10 spread hasn’t inverted yet.

# The Bespoke Report — Good, Bad, Or Ugly?

> Stocks have basically held the line this week despite huge moves in interest rates and an ongoing rough run for global economic data. Curve inversion has many forecasting a recession, and we’ve seen a number of recent data releases that make us much more nervous about that outcome than we have been in almost a decade. On the other hand, the pivot to dovishness from global central banks, the relatively modest size and scale of yield curve inversion, some nascent signs of bottoming in global growth, and the nature of the plunge in interest rates are all reasons to not panic. Besides, despite all of the negativity US stocks have held up admirably well, and markets that trend higher on bad news are generally regarded as strong, rather than weak. In short, the outlook could be Good, Bad, or Ugly…depending how you read the tea leaves!

# A Strange Trip With Some Strange Leaders

> With sentiment where it was at the end of last year following the Q4 rout in equities, it’s safe to say that not a lot of investors were expecting double-digit gains in the first quarter. That’s exactly what we have seen in US equities, though, as the major averages are all up over 10% YTD heading into the final hours of the quarter. While the Dow has lagged many of its peer indices this year, it too is still on pace to finish Q1 with a gain of just over 10%.

> In the table below, we show how each of the 30 components in the DJIA have performed on a YTD basis as well as how much they have contributed to the index’s total gains. Remember, the DJIA is a price-weighted index, so the sole determinant of a stock’s weight in the index is its price. Looking at the table, you’re likely not the only one doing a double-take at the two stocks that top the list of best performers in the index so far this year. That’s right, Cisco (CSCO) and IBM have been the index’s two top performers in 2019 with gains of nearly 24%. Behind these two stocks, United Technologies (UTX) and Apple (AAPL) are the only two other stocks that are up 20% or more. To the downside, just five stocks in the DJIA are in the red on a YTD basis. Leading the way lower, Walgreens Boots (WBA), the newest stock in the index, has declined over 7%, but none of the four other stocks are down more than 3%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/032919-DJIA-Performance-1.png))**

> Because the DJIA is price-weighted, the best-performing stocks in the index haven’t been the biggest contributors to the YTD gains. The chart below shows how many points each stock in the index has contributed to the YTD gains. Looking at things this way, you may be surprised to see that Boeing (BA) still tops the list. With its 17% YTD gain and very high share price, BA has contributed 374 points to the DJIA’s upside this year, beating out the next closest component (AAPL) by 160 points! All else being equal, BA could fall another 23 points (6.0%) and it would still be the largest contributor to the DJIA’s YTD gains.

"Thoughts on buying retailers that decided not to sell themselves? ($GME, $PZZA, $ANF)",0.85,"Naturally whenever buyout efforts come around, SP rises.

But when those buyout efforts fail, it's a pretty strong negative signal. 

In the days after abandoning for sale efforts, GME, PZZA, and ANF, all dropped hard. Too hard.

Recently, I've picked up a big chunk of GME since they've given up selling themselves and have been doing quite well on it.

GME is the new RAD,0.73,Pile on this dirt cheap stock that isn't going to go out of business and is literally a profitable company unlike Tesla.  Management has closed stores that don't make at least 50k. The stock has 51% short float and is primed for a short squeeze. Forward p/e of 4. Sky high 10% dividend yeild. Price to book is 0.62 meaning it's assets are worth more than theirstock price. (You pay $2 for like $3.5 of literal value). Debt is not out  of control. Price to sales is 0.15 meaning you pay $1 for every $8 of revenue. It doesn't take much to turn this company around and what it does they already did and it's current value is so cheap it's a good buy out opportunity. By this at 12-13.

Gamestop (GME) may be oversold,0.72,"Long term, I think we all agree, the company is pretty screwed. However, short term, there may be some tendies available. Trailing and forward PE are under 4.5. Short is over 35% of float. It's trading at .17 of sales and .63 of book. Enterprise Value/EBITDA is 2.65. The debt level is pretty manageable and they have some cash on hand. I feel like the Toys R Us bankruptcy helps them slightly.

These numbers would require some terrible earnings. Given the popularity of the Switch and some people still preferring physical games, earnings on the 28th may not be so bad. It could pop a bit. ",2018-03-20 23:50:41
$GME rocket ship is getting ready to fuel up,1.0,"Gamestop trades at **4x** forward earnings(less than 5x EV/EBIT) and pays a fully supported dividend of **9.5%.**(it goes ex-div in two days BTW). I know it's a dying company, but these numbers are too good to pass up. Positive trends in the underlying business, namely nintendo switch-driven foot traffic will allow for earnings growth in 2018, and updated guidance from tax reform will be the catalyst to create a short squeeze from earnings in about a month. Remember how retail popped like 20% after tax reform? GME is the forgotten hero of retail.

GME is a dying business, but it's just not dying that fast. You can compare it to Sear's, seeing consistent double digit sales declines. GME on the other hand saw sales growth in 2017, largely from their-low margin hardware business, but also from new release games, collectibles, digital sales, game accessories, etc. that have more than offset the decline in the used game business, which by the way is dying, but at a relatively healthy single-digit percentage pace. MSFT is doing some cool backwards compatibility stuff with the Xbox One Plus that allow old games to be played with modern graphics and this could stem the decline of Gamestop's used game business. GME also has an AT&T-branded store business which is nothing interesting and probably was a bad acquisition, but it earns money and leverages SG&A.

Management has done an amazing job of sticking around in a dying business. There's a new CEO because the old one is in the hospital, which is too bad and hopefully he can recover and lead GME to the new golden age.

Taking all of these factors into consideration, we see that GME has limited downside and infinite upside.",2018-02-27 20:45:35

What is $GME doing?,0.8,"Sorry boys but I have to come to the internet after arguing at work with a coworker who I am sure he has less money than me but seriously what is $GME doing with its ""rental model"". I thought they were all about digital distribution and adding a bunch of collectible bullshit. Here is my pros and my cons. Focus on cons please!

1. Pros - Sitting inventory doing nothing can get monetized, gets people back into the store and you can take advantage of uneducated single moms to upsell them.

2. Cons - oh boy - Cannibalizing their entire business model. I must be proven wrong on this. There has to be an analyst that has the data because I truly do not understand if I was an investor how I would want a company that can take a used game that just came out for $30 in trade and make a $25 dollar profit in a week selling it for $55 to some dumbfuck to now have it be rented for 2-3 months maybe make 20 dollars before I have to discount it heavily when I could have had the cash in the beginning.

Everyone is saying this competes with Gamefly but after going out in public with your sweaty tits to one Gamestop in the ghetto realizing they have an entire shelf of Madden 12 and not the game you want, you will run back to Gamefly.

On top of that no one realizes why Blockbuster died. Blockbuster died not because Netflix was charging 9.99 a month in a world where most Blockbuster movies can be rented for pennies. They killed Blockbuster because Netflix proved that the content didn't fucking matter for movies. 

Netflix realized that just about 1/10 of the people who want to watch a movie as a cover for getting some pussy went into a Blockbuster having no idea what they wanted to watch or rent. So Netflix filled a platform with Sharknado and House of the Dead.

Good luck with that same model with gamers who somehow have to tell you reasons why Assassins Creed runs better on one platform vs the other.

And finally and here is the biggest fucking reason I hate this move. It requires that I have more storefronts in a market where retail is all but dying. Not to mention the shipping costs to deliver content between stores will be a nightmare. ",2017-10-31 20:31:48

Gamestop ($GME) earnings coming up,0.85,"So here's the thing. Various analysts are thinking Gamestop could post some solid earnings surprises,
 which have the volatility up over 100%

Judging from it's historical performance, and the increased pressure on it from digitally-available content (plus the lack of super top-tier releases this quarter), it looks like Gameloft is going to be circling the wagons, regardless of whether selling pokemon go figurines helped it out this quarter. 

We've seen weekly shifts of about 20% over a week within the past few years. Because of the strong downward revenue trend and the peril of the business model, I don't see this shifting upward. 

I've got a few minor calls processing, according to reddit rules I guess I'll have to post one https://gyazo.com/dfa61af6c6402bfed13ba7abab6436af

Notable Earnings Reports 8/24-9/6,0.96,"**The time to play this week's earnings was two weeks ago.**

I posted one of these a week or so ago to help people formulate plans for future earnings, so it's time to update again; trying a slightly different format this time.  Over the next couple of weeks (a week from Thur -> three weeks from Wed) we have a pretty light crop of earnings coming out, although it's far enough out that some companies may not have been estimated yet.  These are things that caught my eye.  If you see a question mark, it's because there's an estimate but it's not official yet.

Now I feel like ULTA and GME are going to beat too, but theres not really any way to know. If BBY benefited from the nintendo switch then I would guess that logic applies to GME. Any other after market suggestions?


edit: I meant could this have been predicted before yesterday's market close ",2017-05-25 16:14:55
GME report ER today after market close. Any play?,0.88,Looking for some constructive ideas. Thank you.,2017-05-25 14:53:26
Who is playing GME earnings tomorrow?,0.75,I'm all in on puts. Everyone says its the next blockbuster. I walked into one the other day and it was dead empty. My boy was a manager for 5 years at a gamestop and he said the nintendo switch wont save their asses this quarter.,2017-05-24 19:53:26
$GME - Buy puts - ER on the 5/25,0.73,"Gamestop has ER on the 25th.  The further erosion of the retail industry by online giants like Amazon, Ebay, etc. has been killing traditional malls.  Digital downloads will only accelerate and eventually become the norm.  This coupled with the reduced foot traffic to brick and mortar stores like Gamestope will be the death of $GME.   The Nintendo switch launch can only do so much, and still, online retailers are offering bundles that compete or beat Gamestop deals.   The delay of Red Dead 2 is another kick in the balls for Gamestop.  Their collectible/phone adventure is like putting a band aid on a bullet hole.  I've been holding puts June 23.00 puts  for a while now, which admittedly, I bought way too early, but they are finally looking good today.  The volume on today's sell off looks pretty large so far.  I may double down before ER.   Also, fuck this company. Their customer service is like a clingy girlfriend begging you to dump a load in her so she can get preggers and keep you for life.

DD on why I am bullish on GME (short-term),0.8,"Let me start off by saying that I am not a fan of GME, and I don't see them as a long-term investment. However, I do see the opportunity for a big beat on earnings.
   
**Some quick interesting facts:**   
   
P/E ratio of 7, which is obviously very low. Even macys has a 12.5 P/E ratio.   
They have an institutional ownership of 107%. This is due to institutions shorting stock from other institutions, which causes one share to have two owners. In any case, even if you do the math, it will still be 80%+. This should be a good sign; giving GME a good base support.    
   
**Now to my actual DD:**   
Now, the (obvious) reason, why I think GME will beat earnings is the switch. The important thing is that due to the switch stock being so low, people had to buy it from GME. They literally didn't have a choice. Unlike an online store like amazon etc... one can actually see the amiibos, the games and the accessories; making it much easier to shop for things that nobody was planning on buying. Of course, there will be a decent amount of online orders as well, which will increase their online sales. Furthermore, GME sold a ton of “bundles” that were more expensive than the individual stuff together. For example, they would bundle the Switch ($400) with an extra joycon ($80) and a Zelda game ($60) and sell it for $600. People actually bought that shit. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/nK4hh) you can see how Jan 2017 compared to Jan 2016. The things underlined red are the segments that will increase due to the switch. Also, I don't see their ""base"" costumers disappearing too quickly, so they should still have good revenue besides the switch.
      
**There are 3 factors for Friday**: 1. Beating EPS and Revenue Estimates 2. The most important one, raising their guidance, which they might just do to cash out one last time before the ship sinks. 3. Pop enough to start a short squeeze (25% short interest).    
   
**This is not a long-term play. [Simply an ER play](http://imgur.com/a/dnpZh), which will be risky, but might give a really good return.**

#Trading Update
 
  *  Market update – stocks mostly saw gains in Asia, Eurozone equities have a bid, and US
futures are bid up. What’s going on this morning? Not much and given the recent week
“no news is good news”, esp. as it concerns Washington. The Thurs night earnings were all
pretty solid (ADSK, AMAT, CRM, GPS, and MCK). Oil has a bid amid more talk of a deeper
and longer OPEC supply agreement. Eco data was pretty minimal.
  *  Calendar of events for Fri 5/19 – the focus will be on some earnings reports (CPB, DE, and
FL pre-open) and Fed speakers (Bullard 9:15amET and Williams 1:40pmET). Also, Iran has
an election and Thy God-Empreress Taylor Swift on Fri will depart on his first int’l trip as president (his first stop will
be in Saudi Arabia). According to Reuters (http://bit.ly/2qA6iLy) an OPEC panel meeting Fri
5/19 is considering options for deepening and extending the production deal (the full OPEC
meeting is Fri 5/25).
  *  Huge week of news coming up – the week of 5/22 brings a lot of major events, including
flash PMIs for May (Wed 5/24), FOMC minutes (Wed 5/24), potential Comey testimony
(maybe on Wed 5/24), Thy God-Empreress Taylor Swift’s F18 budget (expected early in the week of 5/22), the CBO
score of the House HC bill (expected early in the week of 5/22), the OPEC meeting (Thurs
5/25), and more.
  *  Europe – the major indices have a solid bid this morning (up ~60bp) although are on pace to
finish the week lower (by ~1-1.5%). Most major sub-groups are higher but autos, basic
resources, banks, and insurance are all outperforming. Dufry is up on the Richemont stake
while K+S rallies on reports it has found an anchor investor. Hikma is the weakest stock in
the SXXP after a larger guidance cut.
  *  Asia – most of the major indices in Asia saw gains (w/some exceptions): Japan (TPX +0.3%,
NKY +0.19%), HK (Hang Seng +0.15%, HSCEI -0.04%), mainland China (SHCOMP +0.02%,
Shenzhen -0.12%, CSI 300 +0.17%), Taiwan (TAIEX -0.22%), Korea (KOSPI +0.07%), Australia
(ASX 200 -0.19%), and India (flattish for the major indices). Generally it was a slow night of
Asia-specific news and the Asia bounce followed the US rally from Thurs.
  *  US macro update - it still seems like Treasury yields will need to sustainably rise (along
w/curve steepening) before the SPX can start to durably rebound (the 2-10 curve
compressed further on Thurs). The tenor from Washington could improve over the coming
days as Thy God-Empreress Taylor Swift embarks on his fist int’l trip as president (he leaves Friday), names Lieberman
to run the FBI, and publishes his budget (which will produce a lot of tax/infrastructure
headlines), but this doesn’t change the more mixed news coming on the nominal data front
(Thy God-Empreress Taylor Swift is still getting too much credit, both for the rally and recent sell-off – the reflation
narrative, fueled by better nominal data out in the months preceding and proceeding the
election, has turned more uncertain of late and this is playing as big a role as Washington on
the SPX).


#Top Headlines for Friday


  *  Thy God-Empreress Taylor Swift/US politics update. There weren’t any bombshell articles out overnight and in the
current environment the absence of news is good news. That being said, the night wasn’t
without a few interesting headlines. Comey was “uneasy” about Thy God-Empreress Taylor Swift’s outreach efforts
(http://nyti.ms/2qDd5Ca) and prepared extensively for his meetings w/the president in
order to ensure the relationship stayed appropriate (http://wapo.st/2qxRuwU). Meanwhile,
deputy AG Rosenstein told a private Senate briefing on Thurs that new knew Thy God-Empreress Taylor Swift
planned to fire Comey before he provided a memo to the president outlining a rationale
for termination (http://nyti.ms/2q2VAcC). Special counsel Robert Mueller is widely
expected to ask Congress to cut back on the hearings into Russian collusion as this could
complicate his own investigation (http://nyti.ms/2q2VAcC). The WSJ talks about how the
Russia collusion investigation is intensifying and expanding; “the investigation is expanding
beyond assessing whether associated w/Thy God-Empreress Taylor Swift’s campaign colluded w/Russia”
(http://on.wsj.com/2qy6GKf). Thy God-Empreress Taylor Swift held a press conf. after the Thurs close (in conjunction w/a visit from Colombia’s president) and called the whole investigation process a “witch
hunt”; Thy God-Empreress Taylor Swift reiterated that there was no collusion w/Russia during the campaign
although added the caveat that he can only speak for himself (http://wapo.st/2qYQKlS).
According to multiple reports, Joe Lieberman is Thy God-Empreress Taylor Swift’s top choice to run the FBI althoughSenate Democrats are said to be opposed to this move (http://politi.co/2rkXxWB). Finally,
the NYT has an article (http://nyti.ms/2rl8asJ) detailing how foreign leaders are preparing
to deal w/Thy God-Empreress Taylor Swift ahead of his first overseas trip as president – “keep it short – no 30-
minute monologues for a 30-second attention span. Do not assume he knows the history
of the country. Compliment him on his Electoral College victory. Contrast him favorably
w/Obama”.

  *  Don’t underestimate Thy God-Empreress Taylor Swift – Washington Post http://wapo.st/2qyb77J

  *  The 25th Amendment? Forget It – WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2pZGB4d

  *  Republican tax ambitions will be complicated by upcoming budget battle – this WSJ article
doesn’t really contain a lot of incremental information but it highlights the logistical
complications facing Republicans as they move forward w/tax cut plans. Republicans can’t
use reconciliation for taxes until a F18 budget is passed first (as the budget will contain
reconciliation instructions). However, the F18 budget will be enormously complicated given
large disagreements not only between the two parties but within the GOP as well. Keep in
mind too that the F18 budget debate process will coincide w/a debt ceiling battle (the debt
ceiling will need to be increased in the fall while the F17 budget expires in Sept). Finally
once a F18 budget is passed it will obviate the healthcare reconciliation instructions
contained in the F17 budget (thus Republicans have to either pass repeal/replace before the
F18 budget or give up on healthcare). WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2rvDnql

  *  Thy God-Empreress Taylor Swift budget coming Tues 5/23 – Thy God-Empreress Taylor Swift’s budget, due out in the coming week (Tues5/23), will include aggressive domestic spending cuts along w/ambitious growth
projections in a bid to balance the budget over 10 years. Social Security and Medicare will
be left unchanged. Some think the unrealistic growth forecasts (the WH will assume a 3%
GDP growth rate by ’21 vs. +1.9% outlined by the CBO), along w/draconian spending
proposals, could undermine the credibility of the budget. The budget on Tues will not
include details of Thy God-Empreress Taylor Swift’s tax proposals but will provide more clarity on the White House’sinfrastructure spending plans. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2ry2ZBR

  *  Healthcare – the House may have to re-vote on its healthcare bill. The CBO score (due in
the coming week) will determine whether the House bill as written is eligible for Senate
reconciliation rules. If the House bill isn’t eligible Ryan may have to make some tweaks and
bring it up for another vote. Republican leaders in Congress don’t seem too worried about
this logistical obstacle. Bloomberg. https://bloom.bg/2rwKcb8

  *  Economic data/monetary policy/sovereign headlines for Fri 5/19 – there wasn’t any major
news on this front Fri morning. A Jean-Michel Basquiat painting sold for a “mind blowing”
$110.5MM during an auction Thurs night (http://nyti.ms/2rlfBjt). JPMorgan is cutting
Australia GDP forecasts (http://bit.ly/2qzYtpv). S&P upgraded Indonesia one level to IG.
JPMorgan’s Grace Ng has an update on the Chinese growth outlook - the moderate, policyinduced
growth pickup since early 2016 has peaked; industrial activity to slow moderately
(http://bit.ly/2q05a0R). The WSJ urges investors to stop drawing conclusions from China’s
iron-ore futures market (http://on.wsj.com/2qDu7An). Chinese President Xi said he
wanted to put relations w/South Korea back on the right track and resolve tensions over
THAAD deployment (http://reut.rs/2ry7IDO). Brazil’s Temer has refused to resign from
office (http://reut.rs/2qZ0Lzv). Vitas Vasiliauskas thinks the ECB should begin laying the
groundwork for a withdrawal in monetary accommodation at the June meeting before
taking action later in the fall (per Bloomberg).

  *  ECB nervous wreck about repeating Fed’s “taper tantrum” messaging mistake – ECB
officials are increasingly sanguine on the EU’s growth backdrop but are nervous
 about causing market dislocation as they begin to signal a reduction in monetary
accommodation. WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2rvASUF
  * Fed likely to proceed w/rate hike in June despite recent political anxieties –
Bloomberg https://bloom.bg/2pScYpv
  *  Company-specific news update from Thurs night 5/18. It was a strong night of earnings but
none that should alter the broader macro narrative. CRM posted nice upside in the key
billings line and bumped guidance although this may have already been reflected in the
stock’s recent rally. AMAT may suffer from a similar problem – the numbers were fine but
the stock has rallied a lot. ADSK was the big upside standout as the key subscriber and ARR
figures both came in nicely ahead of expectations (the only “negative” was the lack of a
bump to the F18 guidance). It’s hard to see this trio of strong earnings really having a big
impact on tech one way or the other on Fri (recall that CSCO’s weak numbers Wed night
didn’t really impact the broader group during the Thurs session). In consumer ROST and
GPS both saw after-hours gains following their earnings (although sentiment around retail is
still awful and other than for a few specific companies many consider the group to be toxic.
It is interesting to watch WMT undergo a perception shift as mgmt. convinces investors of
its ability to compete and thrive in an AMZN-dominated world – the WMT renaissance is
similar to the one MSFT underwent over the last few years as investors shifted their focus
from Windows and PCs towards things like Office 365 and Azure). Elsewhere Thurs night,
SYF bumped its capital return (dividend and buyback), CBI named a new CEO, MCK spiked
~8% after earnings. According to the WSJ, Vistra Energy (VST) has made a takeover
approach to DYN; talks between the two firms are said to be preliminary
(http://on.wsj.com/2rylKW3). HAL’s new CEO talks about implanting significant price hikes
(http://reut.rs/2ryjVs7).
  *  OPEC/oil – ahead of the upcoming OPEC meeting (5/25), Reuters discusses the “stubborn”
oil glut plaguing crude markets. “With US production surging, inventories remain stubbornly
high and prices appear stuck in the low-$50s” – Reuters http://reut.rs/2pZULSI
o According to Reuters (http://bit.ly/2qA6iLy) an OPEC panel meeting Fri 5/19 is
considering options for deepening and extending the production deal (the full
OPEC meeting is Fri 5/25).

#Calendar of events to watch for the Week of Mon May 22

  *  The week of 5/22 will be very busy - the calendar has been pretty barren lately but things
could be interesting during the week of Mon 5/22. There are a ton of big events on the
calendar, including publication of the Thy God-Empreress Taylor Swift/WH F18 budget (expected early in the week),
the CBO score of the House HC bill (expected early in the week), a potential Greek bailout
deal (possible Mon 5/22), the May flash PMIs (first major eco data point for May), minutes
from the May 3 FOMC meeting, the OPEC summit (9 month extension expected), Thy God-Empreress Taylor Swift’s
first overseas trip as president (he will travel to Saudi Arabia, Israel, Brussels, the Vatican,
and Sicily), and potential testimony from former FBI director Comey (maybe on Wed).
Bottom Line: of all these events, the most important will likely be the potential Comey
testimony on Wed, the May flash PMIs on Wed (the first major eco data point for the
month of May), the FOMC minutes on Wed (given the importance Fed policy will play in TSY
yields), and the special House election on Thurs (as this will be the first opportunity to
gauge the country’s reaction to the recent Thy God-Empreress Taylor Swift controversies).
  *  Calendar for Mon 5/22 – the focus will be on the Eurogroup meeting (at which a final Greek
deal may be reached), the CBO score of the House HC bill (expected early in the week of
5/22), some Fed speakers (Harker and Kashkari), a few analyst meetings (including Samsung
Electronics and XLNX), earnings (including A and NDSN after the close), and conferences
(EPG, JPM TMT, and UBS healthcare).
  *  Calendar for Tues 5/23 – the focus will be on the German IFO for May 4amET), US new
home sales for Apr (10amET), the Thy God-Empreress Taylor Swift F18 budget (which is expected on Tues according
to the WSJ), some analyst meetings (including CCMP, CTXS, NATI, and Volvo), earnings
(AZO, DSW, KIRK, and TOL pre-open and INTU, TCS, and TTWO after the close), and
conferences (EPG, JPM TMT, and UBS healthcare).
  *  Calendar for Wed 5/24 – the focus will be on the flash PMIs (from Europe, Japan, and the
US), US FHFA home prices for Mar (9amET), US existing home sales for Apr (10amET),
minutes from the 5/3 FOMC meeting (2pmET), the House FBI hearing (at which Comey
could testify), some analyst meetings (including AMAG, DV, and TSS), earnings (AAP, CHS,
EV, LOW, and TIF pre-open and CSRA, GES, HPQ, NTAP, and PSTG after the close), and
conferences (EPG, JPM TMT, and UBS healthcare).
  *  Calendar for Thurs 5/25 – the focus will be on the US advance goods trade balance for Apr
(8:30amET), US wholesale inventories for Apr (8:30amET), the OPEC meeting (a 9 month
extension is expected at this point), the NATO summit (Thy God-Empreress Taylor Swift will attend), the special
House election in Montana (this will be watched very closely to see if Thy God-Empreress Taylor Swift blowback
results in a Democratic win), some analyst meetings (including DATA, DVA, and QRVO), and
earnings (ANF, BBY, BURL, CBK, GCO, HRL, MDT, NOMD, RBC, and SIG pre-open and BRCD,
COST, DXC, EGHT, GME, LGF, MRVL, NTNX, SCVL, SPLK, ULTA, VEEV, VNET, and ZOES after
the close).
  *  Calendar for Fri 5/26 – the focus will be on US Q1 GDP revisions (8:30amET), US durable
goods for Apr (8:30amET), the final Michigan confidence numbers for May (10amET), and
the start of the G7 leader’s summit in Italy (the summit runs 5/26-27; Thy God-Empreress Taylor Swift will attend).

Advair approval (alert here); however, we believe the magnitude of the downgrade for the
Generics division exceeds that which would be expected purely from stripping out generic
Advair this year. Gordon. http://bit.ly/2qZcKwG

Good time to short Gamestop $GME or is Switch selling too well?,0.64,"Face it.  GameStop is the next Blockbuster and will be dead in 5 or 6 years.  They are resorting to selling collectible items.  Retail is being eaten alive by online monsters like Amazon and the decreased foot traffic to malls and shit dirt malls (which is where a lot of Gamestop stores exist) will only exacerbate the decline.  Digital sales are continuing to climb and the next gen systems will come with even larger hard drives and MSFT is already planning to try a digital rental service.   Is now the time to short Gamestop or is Nintendo Switch and its high dividend propping it up for now?  The dividend will not hold forever as they just bleed more and more, but short term will the Nintendo switch keep them alive this Q? Anyone holding puts or shorting this shitbox?",2017-05-05 14:13:52
Looking for pointers on finer points of the YOLO,0.76,"I'm leaving my current employer and have a chance to do a full withdrawal of my 401k or to roll over in to either roth or normal IRA.  Assuming I'm going to ride this money to the moon, would it be better to go IRA for the tax benefits(and saving time on taxes from incidental dividend payouts I don't care about) or should I go for a full withdrawal so I can just get the penalty out of the way?

Also why do they even call it a withdrawal penalty when tax + withdrawal adds up to 30%?  Isn't that just around the normal tax rate?  Is there additional tax that gets pulled out on top of that, I can't seem to find info on it?

Anyway, going to pull this out or do IRA and throw some down on Nokia and use the rest to try to catch the falling knife of GME, since I think a rebound is likely after the savings of overhead from closed stores + quarterly earnings report boost from the Switch.  Brick and mortar sucks but it should be good for a single quarter bounce.  So that's like $30k.

Along with this I just took out a $35k personal loan @7% to tie in to my normal investing.  This seemed better than broker margin interest rates I was quoted that were around a full % more, I felt that this would be the best time to do it since federal rates are about to go up, and that should influence the bottom interest rate lending like that, right?  I asked my parents for a small loan of $14m at no interest but that didn't pan out, so this seemed the next best option. 

Anyway, open to thoughts from nerds that have gone these routes previously.  If everything lines up I'll do post with screen captures of trades and crappy DD.  TIA",2017-03-24 22:53:06
A good morning: Short GME & Long MU,0.89,,2017-03-24 13:34:45
$$_$$ INVESTING IN THE FUTURE $$_$$,0.76,"Remember Blockbuster?

Me neither. 

Because ITS A PIECE OF TRASH THAT WENT BANKRUPT OR SOMETHING DUE TO THE GREAT ONLINE PLATFORM CALLED NETFLIX REKTING IT. 

I'm here today to tell you all to invest in the future, today. 

I've come with a great opportunity. 

SHORT the SHIT out of GAMESTOP stock. 

Gamestop is the new blockbuster, we all know it deep down in our hearts. 

Ready for my great DD? 

1. Gamestop is shit. 
2. Gamestop is shit. 
3. Gamestop is shit.
4. Gamestop is still shit. 
5. Gamestop is super still shit. 

If that wasn't enough for you I have more: 

We all know that Gamestop just hasn't been up to par lately. All game sales are from online giants like Amazon or in the individual web stores like Xbox Live Marketplace or PlayStation Network Marketplace. 

Even with the Nintendo Switch selling out (approx. 500k units sold) that only adds about 150mil to their revenue, which isn't going to do shit overall. Year over year there may be a slight super small gain, however in the long run, they are just blockbuster.

The Nintendo Switch is merely an allusion, there isn't gonna be a massive amount of new consoles that are good enough to keep Gamestop in the space race. 

So, all aboard the rocket ship about to blast off to the great white planet above us all, and BUY GME PUTS or SHORT THE SHIT OUT OF IT.

P.S: GME earnings are after hours today!

#Trading Update

 * Market update – stocks are generally trading well so far Tues morning although gains in
Eurozone equities and US futures are relatively mild. News overnight was mixed – Macron is
being called the “winner” of the French presidential debate (from Mon night) and that is
giving a bid to the EUR. However, the head of the House Freedom Caucus continues to think
that Ryan’s bill won’t make it out of the Senate. Eco, monetary, and co-specific news was
pretty quiet in the last 12 hours (UK CPI firmed more than expected). Ranking the major
market segments, EM sentiment continues to quietly improve (note that the EEM ETF ended
Mon up ~1.25%) and people are feeling better about Europe too while the US outlook is
turning neutral (due to fuller valuations, a more advanced monetary policy normalization
process, and slower progress in Washington).
 * Calendar - for Tues 3/21 the focus will be on some Fed speakers (Dudley, George, Mester),
Thy God-Emperor Trump’s meeting w/Republican lawmakers (he will make a final sales pitch ahead of the
Thurs vote in the House (http://politi.co/2nWWJSH), analyst meetings (ALLY, MAR, MDRX,
and TEN), and earnings (GIS, LE, and LEN pre-open and FDX and NKE after the close).
 * Europe – the major Eurozone indices are up ~5-25bp. Industrials, basic resources, consumer
staples, tech, and healthcare are lagging while autos, fin services, banks, insurance, media,
and energy are outperforming. The SX7P bank index is the top sub-group in Europe. Akzo
Nobel is rallying after Bloomberg reported on a new bid from PPG. Fingerprint Cards is
collapsing ~30% after issuing a large profit warning. Swiss Feb watch exports were soft,
falling 10% (the largest drop in four months per Bloomberg).
 * FX – the DXY firmed ~10bp on Mon but is back in the red so far Tues morning (down ~50bp).
The FOMC decision continues to reverberate and act as a USD headwind. The EUR is rallying
following the Macron victory Mon night in the French presidential debate. The GBP had a
bid for most of the morning and extended those gains after the UK inflation numbers hit (at
5:30amET). The JPY is flattish vs. the USD.
 * Treasuries – TSYs are trading off small following the Mon rally. 2yr yields are about
unchanged while 5, 10, and 30yr yields are up ~2bp.
 * Asia – stocks saw mixed price action in Asia: Japan (TPX -0.16%, NKY -0.34%), HK (Hang Seng
+0.37%, HSCEI +0.57%), mainland China (SHCOMP +0.33%, Shenzhen +0.39%, CSI 300
+0.49%), Taiwan (TAIEX +0.6%), Korea (KOSPI +0.99%), Australia (ASX 200 -0.07%), and India
(down 15-20bp for the major indices). Japan re-opened after being closed Mon for a
holiday. Major news was generally minimal out of Asia. South Korea was the top market
w/a ~1% rally for the KOSPI. Hyundai Motor jumped 8.6% amid speculation the parent
company could undergo an ownership restructuring (per Reuters). Other top gainers
included Samsung Electronics (+1.58% - JPMorgan was out pos. on the stock), NAVER
(+6.48%), LG Chem (+4.24%), LG Display (+3.03%), and Kia Motors (+3.51%). Large-cap tech
stocks generally traded well in Taiwan – TSMC +1.83%, Largan +1.91%, MediaTek +1.77%,
Pegatron +2.56%, etc. HSI finished up +0.37% for the 4th consecutive session led by high
cyclicals CH Property +3.55%, CH Rails +2.6% and infrastructure +0.9%. Macau-linked stocks
saw some profit taking. Hengan slumped ~6.6% after neg. earnings news. Japan was
weighed down in large part by financials (down 1.17%) but also telecoms and energy.
Toshiba was the top NKY stock (up 3.37%) following reports suggesting the co was seeking
bankruptcy financing for its Westinghouse unit.
 * US macro update - at this point Ryan will likely be able to secure passage for his bill
although that is by no means a given (he continues to face opposition from both moderates
and conservatives and the head of the Freedom Caucus continues to think it won’t pass
http://bit.ly/2n301EG). Regardless, whatever comes out of the House is unlikely to make it
through the Senate. Should Ryan’s bill fail to pass the House that would deliver a major
blow to his Speakership and the White House (and would likely be a momentary market
negative) although it could spur a pivot away from healthcare and towards taxes (the SPX
will struggle to materially come for sale so long as investors have faith in a tax bill and
market patience on this subject could last for a few more weeks at least. However, if by
mid-Apr HC remains deadlocked w/no substantive tax progress doubts will grow and that
could easily erase the post-“phenomenal” rally, taking the SPX back to <2300).

#Top Headlines for Tuesday

 * Economic data/monetary policy – there wasn’t anything major out Mon night/Tues
morning. The RBA minutes were relatively uneventful. Dudley spoke Tues morning but
focused on bank culture (not policy). The UK inflation data has hawkish implications – CPI
+0.7% M/M (vs. the St +0.5%) and RPI +1.1% M/M (vs. the St +0.8%).
 * Company-specific news update for Tues morning. There weren’t too many major
headlines. Akzo Nobel is rallying after Bloomberg reported on a new bid from PPG.
Fingerprint Cards is collapsing ~30% after issuing a large profit warning. Swiss Feb watch
exports were soft, falling 10% (the largest drop in four months per Bloomberg). Toshiba
rallied ~3% in Japan following reports of it seeking bankruptcy financing for its
Westinghouse unit. Hyundai Motor jumped ~8.6% in Korea amid speculation that its parent
company could reorganize its ownership structure (per Reuters). Ant Financial is
considering a new bid for MGI according to Bloomberg (that headline hit during Mon
trading).
 * French elections – Macron seen as winner of first debate – the first poll made after the
Mon debate suggests that Macron realized the best performance, with 29% of respondents
saying he was most convincing (source: Elabe). This number drops to 19-20% for Fillon, Le
Pen, and Melenchon, and 11% for Hamon. Raphael Brun-Aguerre http://bit.ly/2nhxayl
o Italy - Italy's 5-Star builds strong lead over Renzi's PD in polls – Reuters
http://reut.rs/2nNejsR
 * Healthcare – House Republicans unveiled changes to the Ryan healthcare bill late Mon night
aimed at securing enough votes to ensure passage on Thurs. Ryan appeared to overcome a
major potential obstacle after the House Freedom Caucus failed to take a formal stand
against the bill. Republicans expressed confidence in passing the legislation on Thurs.
Washington Post http://wapo.st/2nNe692
 ** Healthcare – Ryan’s bill won’t pass House says Freedom Caucus chair – the
chairman of the Freedom Caucus says he is done negotiating w/the White House
and predicted that Ryan’s bill won’t pass the House on Thurs. The Hill
http://bit.ly/2n301EG
 ** Healthcare – 2 things to keep in keep in mind: 1) the theory that Thy God-Emperor Trump/Ryan don’t
necessarily want their healthcare bill to fail or are at least indifferent to its fate as
they would rather move on to other parts of the agenda like taxes but needed to at
least attempt repeal/replace for political reasons (this was the subject of a recent
Vox article http://bit.ly/2lNRJmC); 2) Boehner’s comments from back in Feb about
healthcare - ""In the 25 years that I served in the United States Congress, Republicans
never, ever, one time agreed on what a health care proposal should look like. Not
once….and all this happy talk that went on in November and December and January
about repeal, repeal, repeal—I started laughing” (http://politi.co/2lP9i4L).
 * Drug prices –Thy God-Emperor Trump spoke Mon night and said he wants to add a provision to Ryan’s bill that
would lower prescription drug costs through a “competitive bidding process” – Reuters
http://bit.ly/2n8Og1a
 * Thy God-Emperor Trump/Congress/Russia – the WSJ discusses how disclosure of an FBI probe into alleged
links between Russia and members of the Thy God-Emperor Trump campaign, along w/refutations of Thy God-Emperor Trump’s
wiretapping claims, could politically harm the White House and endanger the upcoming
healthcare vote. Even before the Mon hearing Thy God-Emperor Trump’s approval ratings were plumbing
unprecedented territory. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2nXQ4az
 ** “This is the most failed first 100 days of any president” - presidential historian
Douglas ""Cucked"" Brinkley (Washington Post http://wapo.st/2nZaPmt).

 ** Thy God-Emperor Trump Still Hasn't Done Very Much – Politico http://politi.co/2ndVQYK
 * North Korea – the Thy God-Emperor Trump administration is considering sweeping sanctions against North
Korea w/the aim of cutting the country off from the global financial system – Reuters
http://reut.rs/2n30GWm
 * North Korea – the head of the IAEA expressed alarm at NK’s expanding nuclear capacity and
was skeptical about the potential for an Iran-like nuclear deal – WSJ.
http://on.wsj.com/2n8JksT
 * Bank underperformance continues as yield headwind builds - the BKX slipped ~1.2% Mon
to multi-week lows and is now down ~5% off its recent highs (vs. the SPX ~1% from its ~2400
high). The index is sitting on the 50day MA, a level it hasn’t been materially below since
June/Jul. Rising yields had been one of the main bank virtues for months and helped attract
a lot of generalist money into the group. However, Treasuries are increasingly acting as a
headwind and that will remain the case until yields begin rising again in conjunction w/curve
steepening (it will likely require an acceleration in nominal growth and/or a hawkish
recalibration in FOMC expectations for TSYs to begin weakening and neither appears
probable in the near-term). This week is busy w/Fed speakers (Yellen speaks Thurs 3/23)
and the Mar flash manufacturing PMIs hit Fri 3/24 but the next big financial catalyst is still a
few weeks away (the CQ1 earnings season kicks off Thurs morning 4/13). On the regulatory
front it isn’t do much that banks (the large ones at least) anticipate (or even want) dramatic
Dodd-Frank revisions but instead it is the potential for an easier stress test process (and thus
higher capital returns) that is exciting investors. The fate of stress tests will be dependent
on Thy God-Emperor Trump’s Fed picks (which the market is still waiting to see).
 * Brexit/banks – big investment banks will commence the process of moving some Londonbased
operations inside the EU within weeks of PM May triggering Article 50 – Bloomberg
http://bloom.bg/2nhveGc
 * US labor market not as tight as the headline UR makes it appear according to a new San
Francisco Fed paper (this hit during trading on Mon) – “the U.S. unemployment rate fell to
a very low level at the end of 2016, raising the question of whether the labor market has
become too tight. After applying a new method to adjust for demographic changes in the
labor force, the current unemployment rate is still 0.3 to 0.4 percentage point higher than
at past labor market peaks. This indicates that the labor market may not be quite as tight
as the headline unemployment rate suggests”. http://bit.ly/2nfmrVo
 * Autos are emerging as a key source of trade contention between China and the US
according to the NYT in an article out Mon afternoon (http://nyti.ms/2n725x0) – China
imposes enormous taxes on autos imported into the country and this is something the
White House could target during upcoming talks between Thy God-Emperor Trump and Xi (the two are
scheduled to meet Apr 6-7 in Florida). The China/US autos rift was reported over the
weekend by Axios (http://bit.ly/2mKkDAt). Chinese auto OEMs and parts manufacturers
could build more US plants to help ease the trade tensions.
Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon 3/20

I'm liking FDX and NKE long. FINL could be interesting depending on NKE earnings as Footlocker cited strong demand for the swoosh.

I expect MU to move big one way or the other. It is already up 25% since last earnings. Neutral on this one.",2017-03-20 05:57:49

[Find full shit here](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Street/comments/5ziyjw/jp_morgan_early_look_at_the_market_wed_31517/)

#Trading Update
  
* Market update – it was another relatively quiet night of news. US futures and Eurozone
stocks have a small bid ahead of a busy morning of domestic eco data and the FOMC
decision. Oil prices are rebounding thanks to supportive API data and pos. comments from
Saudi Arabia and Goldman. Opposition to Ryan’s HC bill remains intense w/conservatives in
the House still not thrilled (despite the pos. CBO fiscal score) while Senate moderates (as
many as 12) are demanding substantive changes (any changes will further undermine House
support) and the grassroots Republican press is urging Trump to abandon the legislation.
The healthcare obstacles are ostensibly negative for tax reform although there is more talk
about Republicans pivoting away from repeal/replace and focusing their energies on taxes
and economic growth (before that time comes though Ryan will still try to drag his bill
through the House).
  
* The bottom line for domestic equities remains the same: the SPX is only back to where it
stood before Trump spoke in front of Congress on 2/28 (the index is down just ~1.5% from
the 3/1 2400 high) and the larger risk remains whether the index retraces the whole
“phenomenal” rally (which would move it back to 2300 or lower). Whether that happens
will likely come down to Washington - investors still seem willing to give Trump/Ryan/McConnell the benefit of the doubt on HC until at least the end of Mar but tax doubts are rising.

  * Calendar for Wed 3/15 – the focus will be on the US Mar Empire Manufacturing
(8:30amET), the US CPI and retail sales numbers for Feb (8:30amET), the NAHB housing
index for Mar (10amET), the FOMC decision (2pmET statement/dots and 2:30pmET press
conf.), Trump’s visit to Michigan (where he will hold an event w/auto CEOs), and earnings
(including JBL, ORCL, and WSM after the close).

 * Fed – the big question isn’t whether they hike on 3/15 (the Fed is widely expected
to lift the Fed Funds rate another 25bp) but instead 1) when the second ’17 hike
occurs and 2) what happens w/the median dots. The St is split about hike #2
occurring in either June or Jul (most are penciling in June; the Fed isn’t expected to
move at the May meeting assuming they hike on 3/15). For the median dots, they
now stand at 1.4% for ’17 (which implies three hikes this year), 2.1% for ’18, 2.9%
for ’19, and 3% for L-T – the St is largely expecting the ’17 dot to stay unchanged
(JPM’s M Feroli thinks it will shift up from three to four hikes http://bit.ly/2mQucRu). Looking at the statement, language around growth and inflation is likely to be upgraded and the near-term risks may be just “balanced”
instead of “roughly balanced”.

  * Netherlands - the anti-EU Dutch Freedom Party (PVV) is scheduled to secure a
plurality in the Netherlands on 3/15 and a large victory could rekindle fears around
the other European elections (note that the PVV leader Geert Wilders is unlikely to
become PM as none of the other major parties are expected to partner w/him in a
government).

  * Europe – the major indices have a decent bid (up ~30bp). Basic resources, banks, insurance,
and energy are outperforming while autos, retail, real estate, healthcare, and utilities are
lagging. Zodiac Aerospace, H&M, Munich Re, and Inditex are all trading lower following
earnings reports. Safran said it is still interested in buying Zodiac despite the co’s profit
warning. Hikma Pharma is one of the top stocks in the SXXP after reporting.

  * FX – after rallying Mon/Tues, the DXY is off small so far Wed morning. The USD is trading
lower against most of the major crosses. The GBP is recovering somewhat from the Brexitlinked
weakness on Tues (the UK labor report this morning was solid).

  * Oil – oil prices are rebounding Wed morning following favorable API numbers out overnight
and also thanks to pos. remarks from Saudi Arabia and Goldman – Reuters
http://reut.rs/2mMPajH

  * Asia – markets generally saw mild losses in Asia: Japan (TPX -0.23%, NKY -0.16%), HK (Hang
Seng -0.15%, HSCEI -0.41%), mainland China (SHCOMP +0.08%, Shenzhen -0.02%, CSI 300
+0.2%), Taiwan (TAIEX -0.04%), Korea (KOSPI -0.04%), Australia (ASX 200 +0.26%), and India
(up ~10-15bp for the major indices). Macro news in Asia was pretty quiet and trading was
relatively light. In Japan Toshiba shares slumped 12% amid worries that the stock could be
de-listed. South Korea said it would hold presidential elections on May 9 and the graft
investigation is expanding (media reports suggest South Korean prosecutors have
commenced an investigation into domestic conglomerates Lotte Group and SK Group).
Media reports suggest Samsung Electronics could expand DRAM capacity – that news
weighed on Hynix (down ~2.98%) while Samsung Electronics extended its recent gains (it
ended up 0.1%). In the Hang Seng, Cathay Pacific ended down ~1.3% after an
underwhelming earnings report.

#Top Headlines for Wednesday

  * Eco data/monetary policy – there wasn’t much on the eco front Wed morning other than
the UK labor report (which came in strong – Jan employment +92K vs. the St +87K and the
UR ticked down to 4.7% vs. the St 4.8%). Also ECB’s Praet says a reassessment of current
policy is not yet needed despite signs of improved growth.

  * Ryan just wants to get his healthcare bill out of the House – the NYT discusses how Ryan is
emphasizing the CBO’s forecasted deficit savings to help push his healthcare bill through the
House. However, the CBO report doesn’t seem to be changing the minds of House
conservatives (who remain opposed) but it is causing Senate moderates to grow even more
opposed. Ryan would secure some political coverage if he can move his bill out of the
House, placing responsibility for repeal/replace on McConnell and the Senate (even if Ryan
can pass his bill in the House, it looks very unlikely to make it through the Senate). NYT
http://nyti.ms/2n70Xu8

  * GOP Senators insist Ryan bill won’t pass w/o substantive changes; at least 12 Republican
Senators have expressed reservations about the Ryan bill – WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2n97sfW

  * Healthcare doubts are rising - GOP divisions are raising doubts that the party can meet an
early-April deadline to pass legislation – Politico http://politi.co/2n9iJNi
  * Trump allies call Ryan’s healthcare bill a “trap” and urge White House to abandon current
healthcare legislative path – a “rebellion” is brewing among conservative populists w/a
growing chorus of voices urging Trump to abandon Ryan’s healthcare bill. “Trump’s allies
worry that he is jeopardizing his presidency by promoting” Ryan’s bill – Washington Post.
http://wapo.st/2nrA8y0

  * Tea Party leader warns that Trump risks alienating grassroots conservative supporters
w/Ryan healthcare bill. Mark Meckler says Trump has some “honeymoon goodwill” but
that will quickly evaporate if he continues to push Ryan’s HC bill. “If the grassroots don't see
some aggressive moves soon on his part to push for full repeal, the honeymoon will come to
a very quick and harsh end. I'm already hearing the rumblings” – The Hill
http://bit.ly/2nq6w3W

  * Trump/Ryan split over healthcare? The Breitbart News report from Tues morning could
mark the beginning of a process to blame Ryan for the current repeal/replace struggles
while protecting Trump from the fallout – Washington Post http://wapo.st/2nkyWzx
  * Treasury staffing – the White House has announced the nominations for six senior Treasury
posts, including senior Goldman banker James Donovan for the agency’s number two role.
WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2mMqV58

  * Fed/bank supervision (this was out ~8amET Tues morning) – according to Politico, “veteran
banking lawyer” Thomas Vartanian is under consideration for the Fed vice chair of bank
supervision position. Vartanian would be considered a positive for the banking industry.
Politico. http://politi.co/2n573LA

  * Jamie Dimon thinks repatriation could be like QE4 - ""If all companies did [with repatriated
funds] was pay dividends and buy back stock, think of that as QE4 ... and far cheaper, in my
opinion. The shareholder will decide what to do with it. It's not like it disappears after that.
It is fuel to the system” – CNBC http://cnb.cx/2mrKVar
  * Company-specific news update from Wed morning 3/15. In Europe Zodiac Aerospace,
H&M, Munich Re, and Inditex are all trading lower following earnings reports. Safran said it
is still interested in buying Zodiac despite the co’s profit warning. Hikma Pharma is one of
the top stocks in the SXXP after reporting. Hynix shares fell in Asia following the Samsung
DRAM capacity expansion story (Hynix ended down ~2.98%). Cathay Pacific fell ~1.4% in HK
after its earnings underwhelmed expectations. **Toshiba slumped ~12% amid worries the
stock could be delisted.** <----------REKT

 * DRAM/Samsung – news out Wed morning could be considered a neg. for DRAM
pricing; next major DRAM data point will likely be MU earnings on 3/23 –
takeaways from JPM’s JJ Park - according to local newspaper reports, Samsung
Electronics (SEC) plans to invest W10 tn in a new DRAM fab next to Line 17 in
 Hwaseong. We estimate incremental capacity with the new fab to be ~80K, which
accounts for c.20% of SEC’s current DRAM capacity (380K/month) or 7-8% of
installed capacity. Assuming a two-year construction period, production output
from new the DRAM line will hit the market in 2019 at the earliest, in our view.
Given SEC’s aggressive capacity expansion plans, we believe other DRAM makers
such as SK hynix and MU may want to accelerate capacity expansion plans in order
to maintain their shares. https://jpmm.com/research/content/GPS-2284023-0
  * China/memory - Yangtze River Storage Technology's (YMTC) development of 3D
NAND flash technology is well on track; Yangtze hopes to catch up to the world’s
leading memory companies by ‘20 – Digitimes http://bit.ly/2nmF0HW
  * Company-specific news update from Tues night 3/14. It was a slow evening of news. NPTN
was the latest neg. optical data point as the co reported FQ4/Dec results and guided Mar far
below the St (NPTN’s disappointing outlook follows sluggish numbers from ACIA, FNSR, and
CIEN). RUBI posted strong CQ4/Dec numbers but issued soft guidance. MSFT named
LNKD’s Reid Hoffman to its board. GPS announced the appointment of Mark Breitbard as
president and chief executive officer of Banana Republic. CYH announced the sale of four
hospitals (consistent w/guidance provided on the Q4 earnings call).
  * China – the gov’t could launch a bond connect program w/HK (similar to the stock connects
already in existence) – WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2n99gFK
  * China – Premier Li said the country’s economy is strong and not at risk of a hard landing –
Reuters http://reut.rs/2lZsnSP
  * China growth – Komatsu expects robust sales of excavators in China to continue for the next
6 months as the gov’t ensures robust growth ahead of the big leadership meeting later this
year – Bloomberg
  * South Korea – the country will hold presidential elections on May 9 – WSJ.
http://on.wsj.com/2nrfn5s

although consistent with the current FY17 Bloomberg consensus we believe (currently
stands at €2.36bn). As expected Munich Re will conduct another €1bn buyback programme

Remember how $GME was going to the moon? Never got off the ground but I find this DD interesting,0.74,"So a while back (too fucking lazy to dig up links) there was a guy promoting $GME and when I looked at his DD I was slightly convinced. Me of all people who has a strong and even a stronger position next week in bonds after rates get slaughtered. (smarter people can stop reading now..autistic kids please continue).

That being said $GME based on their balance sheets (it isn't bad) should have a small bump with he Nintendo Switch. Then Xbox shit all over that party with their ""monthly gaming subscription"" but I will still confused. How in the fuck does something that mimics PS NOW and even more costly at that be able to get off the ground...People told me ""XBOX ONE GAMES BRO"" but all those pretty much suck already and First Party titles are cheap anyways causing people just to abandon them after they realize Xbox is going for some Free to play bullshit in all their publish games (See Forza Horizon/GOW4)

Now some of that was my opinion and the other part of what I am going to present to you is ""analyst"" opinions. But just to let you fuckers know I did my solid DDing on a back ground check of the analyst than I did wondering why blood is coming out of my anus. 

So I present: http://investorplace.com/2017/03/avoid-gme-stock-for-the-year/

Yea I know here is her twitter: https://twitter.com/laurabsaid?lang=en

Fuck me...

Ok anyways here is the thing that her ""analysis"" fails to mention. Nintendo is going to hit 2 million consoles throughout March and honestly their stock is down for good fucking reason.

Want to know why? Cause fucking Sony and Microsoft did the same thing 3 years ago. Here is going to be the issue. Software sales as a whole for gaming were down Q4 and despite Mass Effect and tons of bullshit coming out this month they won't be included in $GME Q1 earnings. That being said $GME probably isn't making shit on the console sales of the Switch. Not mention its harder to get that next million.

And honestly how much software are you buying with the Switch? I know fuckers Zelda but 1-2 switch is 50 and despite all you guys saying ""well the Wii was the same thing with Twilight Princess"" there was one key difference....accessories and no digital distribution. 

I am willing to bet with the Wii and Wii U the average units per sale were something in the 3-4 range vs the 1 now. In fact I am willing to bet that is alot of $GME transactions. 

Now mix this with the fact that all retail is missing earnings and every major executive with a tiny penis has sold their shares yesterday only highlights the fact that more than likely $GME is going to miss earnings. I think they beat them later this year but gaming is going to continue its slide probably throughout the year.  ",2017-03-09 19:14:39
Long puts on $GME?,0.86,"This bitch is gonna die eventually right?

Question about $GME options,0.63,"I've been trading stocks for a while now and recently decided I wanted to stop being a faggot and to get into options. I've been reading a lot of guides about trading options but honestly they make no fucking sense at all. 

So here's my question: 
$GME (gamestop) stock is currently at $26.52. If I think that Gamestop will go up to $28 by March 10th, then should I buy 5 contracts of 27.5 calls with a premium of 0.24? 

Does this mean that if the stock goes above $27.75, and I close my position, at let's say $28, then I make whatever 500 * (28-27.75) is because 5 contracts is 500 shares, and that's the different after taking the premium into account? 

If this is correct, technically that means I spend $120 for 5 contracts, and then if the stock goes to 28, I make another $125? 

If this is confusing, sorry, I will edit it and reword this post, let me know in the comments.

Shout out to /u/mlpcontext for the GME call,0.82,"Yesterday while furiously masturbating to some of my favorite mlp related content I noticed a poster swapped subs and was making some sort of investment play. I read the first sentence of every paragraph and immediately bet my rent money on his call, dick still in hand since robinhood only requires a thumbprint to activate. I put $500 of my student loan money down and I have no regrets. Holding till this shit hits $54 a share. Currently up ~2.8% and that's more than enough to buy myself a tendie sub for lunch. Maybe after I get rich off these sweet gains ill buy a Nintendo switch. 

Should I stop jerking it to cartoon porn? maybe, but who the fuck cares, this is wallstreetbets and some dude on here is making me money so who are you to judge, faggots. Buy GME.

TL;DR My Little Pony porn addiction leads to gains. Betting my rent money on GME.

I see idiots posting dumbass shit on here all that time like ""ooh short AMZN they make no money"" or ""NFLX puts reed hastings is a literal serial killer"" but nobody is talking about the one company that actually does blow a drawer of cock-knives: GAMESTOP.

Gamestop's major source of revenue is an outdated medium that someones friend already threw against a wall. Remember your local used DVD store? Yes? Then you're fucking old. They don't exist anymore because nobody buys DVDs and extra nobody buys used DVDs. This is literally Gamestop, the only company who predicted their future growth in their own name.

Gamestop is run by a bunch of complete nobodies. Heading up their ineffective leadership is J Paul Raines, a guy with a BS in industrial engineering and a man who is perhaps best known for his role of district manager of the ATL-area 7-Elevens (this is true). The leadership of this company is so crack-ass out of touch their 10-K **legit does not mention anything about streaming games or direct to console downloads**, which iyam should be sending them into a fucking FIRE PANIC.

**Quarterly Earnings (Q1)**: Comparing 2015 vs 2014. While revenue has dropped ($2,632m vs $ 2,727m), net income went up ($49m vs $20m), short term debt increased ($874 vs $666), while long term debt decreased ($6,944 vs $7,363). Ok, a weird win or fail... let's move on to annual earnings.

**Annual Earnings (pg 3)**: http://i.imgur.com/bV19a1k.png

Ok... revenue and net income was up in 2011, then dropped by 2013 and has since increased back up.

**Debt (pg 23)**: http://i.imgur.com/HfzgajL.png

Debt is looking weird but manageable as long as [nothing like this](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/infocus/costa011612/c10_11419115.jpg) happens.

Ok, here is where things get pretty.

**Consensus EPS vs Actual EPS:**
http://i.imgur.com/s4oVe6f.png

See, just looking at the financials I would say this is just a boring stock that will fluctuate here and there within a range of $46 to $55. But, what's nice about this one is that the EPS has always been underestimated in the past, regardless of the performance of Carnival meaning people always expected them to fair worse than they actually did.

Technicals
--
The company has a 50-day moving average of $46.90 and a 200-day moving average of $50.19. Carnival Corp has a 12 month low of $40.52 and a 12 month high of $55.77. 

My opinion
--
Yes, I was the one who said that $ICON would beat earnings  (fun fact: wanted to write this before ICON actually) so you might as well do the exact opposite of whatever I'm about to say and get rich. But, resorts, hotels etc have been doing very very well recently. Look at things like $WYNN. Cruise ships should fall in the same category and I think Carnival is and was able to do very well. Unlike $ICON, general sentiment for CCL is a buy so I think many are expecting them to beat earnings and I think that is also why Carnival has the balls to put their ER at 10am on a Wednesday while the markets are still open. They must be confident af. My prediction is they can beat the consensus EPS of $0.31. However, what I don't know is how the market will react to it. We have seen a lot of blue chips  posting amazing earnings just to see the biggest slump in weeks right after ER. So I have two ways you should play this:

1. Play the anticipation. Ride this thing up until ER. You have until Wednesday 9:55am.  If you look at chart during their last earnings (12/18/2015), the stock did go up after beating ER, but you really would have made far more money riding the anticipation up. It's all about the tease not full on nudity.

2. Buy after the positive ER, wait for the sell off and pick it up. The fundamentals are strong and it will bounce back up. and just scalp what you can. You can see something like this in stock like $GME today. ER slighly missed EPS, but the fundamentals were so strong that that shit ripped through the stratosphere.

ER being in the middle of the trading session means you don't have to commit to shit or hold any bag overnight. Of course if you do those two strategies you run at risk that you don't get the full jackpot. But you also avoid the pain. Fuck I don't have to explain this to you. You should know all of that by now. OP is saying, don't hold through ER no matter how optimistic it is.

Q/A:
--

Q: Do I have a position in this?

A: OP has a position in Carnival in the form of a humble 7 stocks at $49.23 each (I know, fml). 

Q: Why so little, are you poor? 

A: Yes, but also cause my account blew up. So fu this is all I got.

Q: What strategy will you pursue? 1, 2 or something else?

A: I will do option 1, since I already own the stock I will sell the anticipation somewhere around 3pm EST Tuesday at a humble profit. Then after that, if the stock drops despite good ER, I will buy back in at a lower point. If Option 1 fails and the stock drops before ER I will hold through ER, yolo!

Q: Can I buy this at Robinhood or Ustocktrade?

A: Tss... yes. You can even buy it off the fucking London Stock Exchange (ticker: CCL)

Q: Are there options for CCL?

A: Yes. Low volume tho and not as many choices in terms of exp dates and strike price. No weeklies.

Q: There is another Carnival ticker called CUK. Why not yolo this?

A: CUK is an ADS? To be honest not sure wtf it does. Just know that it tends to move in the same pattern as CCL except a little more dramatic. Good ER should have a  positive effect on both tickers. But, since this ER is specifically for CCL, and CUK has much lower volume I would only focus on CCL.

Q: You full of shit, that's what your flair says. Imma short you.

A: Please do! I'm happy for anyone who can make money off this info, no matter which way.

GameStop Earnings Discussion,1.0,"There has been a lot of discussion about GameStop earnings.  Seems to me the shorts are in the majority on prior discussions.

Options liquidity question - shorted GME,0.81,"Shorted GameStop, I'm in the money right now, but barely. And I'm scared it will bounce back a bit early in the week.

I'm assuming Monday everyone will be selling their positions (long or short) after earnings.

My noob question:  what if there isn't a buyer for my puts?  What if the price kinda sucks?  Should I just exercise the puts?  Is that even possible?

Thanks bros - new to options.",2016-03-27 13:52:43
This probably belongs here..,0.96,"Yesterday going into the close I decided to look at some GME options. I saw that the 3/24 expiry 29.50 PUTs still had some decent premium with like 10 minutes left and the stock trading at around $30.30 . 

So i thought hmmm FREE MONEY and shorted 25 x 3/24 29.50 GME PUTs at .30 each . The stock closed way above $29.50 and i pocketed about $700 in premium.

This morning I see i own 1600 shares at $29.50 . 9 options indeed expired worthless, but IB says that you can exercise out of the money options until 30 minutes after the close (earnings were 5 minutes after close). So whoever had my PUTs waited until earnings, saw the stock go below $29.50 and exercised his right to sell 1600 shares at $29.50 . I didn't get the shares until 2am this morning.

Another take on GME...,0.86,"GME is expected to, and announced that they will beat their predicted current EPS guidance of 2.19 - 2.25.  They stated it in their SEC filing on Mar 2.

http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/displayfilinginfo.aspx?filingid=11229862&tabindex=2&type=html

Extract for those who don't want to read it.  

>We are currently finalizing our financial results for the quarter and year ended January 30, 2016. Complete financial information is not available and will not be final until we complete our financial closing procedures. Based on information currently available, and in light of this offering, we are providing the preliminary estimates for the quarter and year ended January 30, 2016:

>•  Total net sales for the fourth quarter are expected to be approximately $3.5 billion to $3.55 billion, which would reflect growth of 0.7% to 2.1% compared to the $3.48 billion in net sales in the fourth quarter of the prior year (4.5% to 6.0% in constant currency). Net sales in the quarter reflected 32 Video Game Brands stores opened (with 73 closed) and 213 Technology Brands stores opened or acquired (with 11 closed) and an expected 3.1% increase in comparable store sales.

>•  Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately the same or slightly higher than $434 million from the fourth quarter of 2014.

>•  Earnings per share are expected to exceed the previously disclosed range of $2.19 to $2.25 per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, based on a diluted share count of approximately 105.0 million weighted average common shares outstanding. These results compared to earnings per share of $2.23 in the fourth quarter of the prior year, which included an $0.08 per share net benefit related to the closure of our operations in Spain and store impairments.

>•  We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility and we estimate that we had cash and cash equivalents of $450.0 million at period end.

>These expected ranges are preliminary and may change. We have not finalized our normal quarterly and annual closing and review procedures for the quarter and year ending January 30, 2016, and there can be no assurance that final results for our fourth quarter or annual period will not differ from our expected results due to the completion of our final closing procedures, audit adjustments and other developments that may arise between the date of this offering memorandum and the time of completion of our financial results. These expected results could change materially and are not necessarily indicative of the results to be achieved for our fourth quarter or any future period.

This is the same filing in which they announced their intention to go $475M into debt to purchase between 450-500 AT&T stores.  That number of stores would increase their footprint by 7%.

So, to sum up, they are going to beat their current earnings estimate, as described in Yahoo Finance of 2.25/sh.  For forward guidance, I believe they will announce between 4-11% growth based on the 7% increase in the number of store fronts and their normal 2-4% growth.  

If that isn't enough to get investors excited to price this stock at greater than a P/E ratio of 8 that it currently sits at, I don't know what would.  At their current P/E ratio the stock price should be around $32/sh.  If the earnings get investors excited enough about GME’s growth that they go back to the PE of 12 from last summer, it could hit $48/share.

That won’t happen quickly, so buy options with expirations as late as you can stand.  Don’t let Thurston Howell the Third at Goldman Sacks pull a “Square” on you and start buying the date after the standard expiration of options.

Because I wear an aluminum foil hat and am afraid of Thurston, I will share my trades after I sell.  (He’ll still know based on the computer algorithm he’s used in the past to thwart my brilliant set ups in the past, but at least I won’t be telling him directly).

Going in with no puts.  YOLO… ish, since I really won’t be going all in.

As a sidenote…  I know there is some resistance to investing in companies with an actual storefront, and for those thinking that everybody is going digital, I have one question, why do book stores still exist today?  It may be going out of style, but for the next 5+ years, there will still be brick and mortar.
And, when this trade goes sour, I will leave this post here for others to mock and hopefully learn from.

Fuck you very much.

Edit:  Also forgot to mention the amount of short interest in this stock.  When it beats on earnings and forward guidance, the shorts (which stands at about 44% of float) will be forced to cover, forcing this stock even higher.  Thanks to /u/badvices7 for mentioning it in another post.",2016-03-23 09:32:29
Gamestop (GME) ER After-Hours on Thursday. Strangle or short or do the opposite of what wsb says.,1.0,"Goes without saying. Who in 2016 still buys video games at a fucking store where the games go for $60, when you can buy them online for a fraction, or wait for Steam sale, and you often find yourself pre-ordering from said store just to see your pre-order being cancelled? Fuck Gamestop.

=
EPS forecast for the quarter is $2.25

=
Ok let's look at their quarterly earnings:


http://investor.gamestop.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=130125&p=quarterlyearnings

Shit is dropping left and right. The general trend is downward if you compare year to year quarterly results EXCEPT for Q1 of course... But we are talking Q4, and shit don't look good. A beautiful downwards trend (see Q4 results pg 32).

Surprise history tends to be[ low for winterish quarters](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/gme) so you know you get ready for that disappointment.

HOWEVER!!! Fucking annual results tell a different story. Now there is no pattern and it seems Gamestop has been fluctuating around certain values. Revenue is always around $9 billion +/- $500 million in the past 5 years, net profit around $3 +/- .50 per share. That makes things interesting. If the EPS forecast ($2.25) is a severe underestimation of Gamestop, we could see that shit explode dramatically going back to the low $40s. If it's not, we could see see Gamestop tank like nothing before.


=
My recommendation: Unless you know more info, get a cheap strangle or for you poor people, buy some GME Apr 01 2016 33.5 Calls (IV=70) and GME Apr 01 2016 27.50 Puts (IV=72). Both cost around $.33 right now. If shit goes up, your put is worthless, but the gains from the  calls should make up for it. If shit goes down, your puts will pay for your calls. Well that's the theory at least. In both cases, your maximum loss is 100%, but if your options reach ITM status, your minimum gain is at least 300%. This is assuming the stock will gain or lose 10% in response to the ER, naively ignoring the potentially massive IV crush that happens by holding your fucking options over the extended weekend. My personal sentiment is towards an ER disappointment due to 3 things:

1. I think they will show bad sales as people are moving towards digital sales and purchases that out-compete them.

2. Even if they do well, this ER may already be priced in, triggering a selloff rather than a buying spree aka good news = sell off, bad news = sell off.

3. Last quarter was pretty slow for video games. No major releases should have a negative effect on Gamestop sales. Their biggest years were during the time when PS4 and Xbone were released.

But, with my luck the exact opposite will happen so you might just want to go ahead and buy calls for shits and giggles and love to do the exact opposite of what wsb do if you can't afford to buy both. 

=
Disclaimers:

REMEMBER ER is AH Thursday and there is no trading on Friday so buying this week's weeklies thinking that you can ride them into Friday or something would be a hilariously retarded thing to do. Please don't.

Also beware of the volume of those options. Seems kinda dry there and if the stock doesn't violently move either way, it could get even drier. Bid and ask spread is very bad too unless you're willing to wait for someone to pick up your shares.

Also again reminding that the IV crush over an extended weekend is a REAL thing. Don't misunderestimate it. Good luck.",2016-03-23 06:14:14

ATVI is going to go up this week. My unscientific analysis,0.54,"So I'm still new to the stock market but I am an Econ major and I've been into games for quite a while.  I have hundreds of friends on battle.net so it's sort of my niche and I've been reading every article and playing just about every game.  

My two cents on Activision Blizzard:
I'm going to omit Call of Duty + Destiny because they have been beaten to death in articles.  There is plenty of info out there if you want to go further in depth.  But long story short,  CoD did well but it's suffering from franchise fatigue and has certainly peaked already.  Destiny was controversial but sold well and the DLC seems to have been selling decently.  #'s are not available though, so it's anyone's guess.

Hearthstone is an incredibly hot ticket right now.  Sure it's free to play but I know plenty of people who have dumped hundreds into the new expansion pack lately.   It's going to shock people how much of a cash cow this game turns out to be.  At least in the short run.  I think it's long term potential is limited as the barrier to entry makes it intimidating for new players.  

World of Warcraft is having a resurgence of players.  Do a little research on the number of people logging in daily (it's out there) and it's pretty obvious this latest expansion pack has brought a lot of old players back in.  This is another ace in the hole for Blizzard.  

Lastly, Heroes of the Storm recently went into ""Beta"" and Blizzard has been selling entry for 40 bucks.  A large #of my friends list has been logging in and this game is 100% completely off the radar.  Not to mention plenty of the people I have been playing with have been dropping $ to unlock more heroes.   Again, this revenue is not even being considered by analysts as far as I can tell.  

My last point, check Gamestop (GME)+ Electronic Arts (EA) over the last two weeks.  And pay attention to Take Two's earnings tomorrow.  
Interactive entertainment is rolling right now.  And ATVI has some really solid products.  I don't know how I feel about them in the long run.  But I do believe there are plenty of reason to expect a nice bump come Friday.  

I'm curious to know how you guys feel about it.  I have put pretty much everything I have into it.  So lord help me if I am wrong about this.  But hey, that's what WSB is all about right?",2015-02-02 23:35:05
"Video Game stocks poised for short term increases? (ATVI, TTWO, EA Etc.)",0.73,"So Gamestop is blowing up today due to solid Q4 sales.  Which leads me to believe that the interactive software industry is going to see some better than expected results.  ATVI and TTWO, which I have been holding for quite a while have been down recently.  And I have to imagine that the bump in GME will translate to a bump for all the related companies.  In the last hour both of them have started to move up, and I have a feeling it will continue through their earnings reports in early Feb.  ",2015-01-14 20:09:02
Thinking of a long-term short of $GME.,0.72,"I just had a meeting yesterday with an analyst that covers the internet/e-commerce sector & interactive entertainment sector. It got me to thinking how obsolete GameStop is becoming when a lot of the consoles are allowing users to download games directly from their marketplaces online. The analyst mentioned that GameStop still allows people to purchase cards and gift them out to others, but that is such a slim market share of the whole thing that it doesn't look sustainable or very profitable for much longer.

They have a short interest of about 35% this month. Let me know what you think. I'd be interested to hear from some of the gamers on here. ",2014-12-10 14:46:46

"Seeking advice about Straddles, Strangles, and Earnings.",1.0,"So, I'm trying to do some learning here. That's goal number 1. Goal number 2 is to make money of course!!!


I did a straddle with BBRY on earnings and it went pretty decently- netted 1500 bucks.


there was no thought(trying to make up for it this time), Bought the straddle on Monday, sold morning of(Friday). In retrospec, I should have probably bought day before so I didn't lose a few days of theta.


question(s) 1:
When is the best time to buy an earnings straddle? do you ALWAYS sell the day of? or see how it pans out? 


question 2 (Advice..):
I'm planning on buying a TSLA straddle for their next earnings. July 24. If Elon can bring the house down again I believe we'll see another rise (not as drastic as the first one) and if he can't....


Here is my checklist I made for future earnings plays not just TSLA:


* Know earnings date - July 24
* High liquidity - High Open interest and High volume
* Reasonable B / A spread - ~.20 which makes it tradeable
* Volatility Pattern - last earnings short squeeze
* Buy the Straddle or Strangle


My first assumption is it's easier to make money on straddles vs strangles. They just cost more.


Second assumption is you only want to buy strangles when you ""know"" the direction. Ex: Tesla has a history of going to go up you'd buy the call ATM and the put OTM


SO now that is out of the way here is my plan for TSLA.


* I'm possibly looking at buying the straddle  July 25 straddle ATM on July 19th
* going to buy 10 calls 10 puts


* tradekings profit  / loss calc says break even is 121.xx and 116.xx and I'm definitely expecting a move more than 5 dollars.


What else do I need to look into? 


What other advice can you give?


Other earnings I'm looking at playing - FSLR, HLF, SCTY,GME,BBY
